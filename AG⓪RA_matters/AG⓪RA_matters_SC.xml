                <![CDATA[<p>用这句话当标题啊，实在是觉得有点儿不雅，加上，刻薄。但又很难抵挡得了诱惑你说咋办？最后只好把万千宠爱给了自己，管它后来洪水滔天。</p><p>这话也不是我的原创，是我从一篇微博的评论区抄来的。就是那篇关于班宇、陈春成、淡豹等著名作家考编的微博。一大早醒来看到消息，不知道为什么硬是从一干人名里看到了个不存在的双雪涛。大概是我前两天才读了他的长篇处女作《翅鬼》的缘故，读完感慨，稚嫩是当然的了，然而自由之精神那时候就有了。而班宇和陈春成，不自觉被我归类和双雪涛同一种类型，虽然我都没读过班宇的任何作品。可能因为我听说过的班宇也是东北人，也爱写下岗潮。而陈春成，也得过宝珀理想国文学奖。我对淡豹的了解很有限，我只记得她当过《随机波动》的嘉宾，至于讲了什么，没留下印象。但那也是随机波动啊！</p><p>一个，一批，字里行间闪烁自由之光的作家，竟然主动委身体制，你说还有比「归来还是喜欢爸爸的大编制」这话更能表达读者的失望之情的吗？</p><p>还好最后证明我眼花，那里头没有双雪涛。我大概只看到个「雪」字就发了狂，那其实是淡豹的真名，她叫刘雪婷。她很惨，没考上，却不得不和金榜题名的另两位一起承受嘲笑。除了家人亲戚，也不知道有没有人同情她。</p><p>班宇的《冬泳》，我甚至有次在书店差点买下来。但班宇离我最近时，是今年热播的国产剧《漫长的季节》，他是这部剧的文学策划。我不知道文学策划是干啥的，原来以为是编剧，后来看报道，这剧的编剧另有其人。但《漫长的季节》这个名字，来自于班宇的同名短篇小说。剧集里王阳在铁轨上给沉默读的那首诗，《漫长的》，也是班宇写的。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/5b2bf3e1-c9e0-4de5-90b9-735d52e027cb.webp/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>这诗的感觉真好，在剧里它是王阳写的，虽然有我有点不信，就像现在我也有点难以相信他是班宇写的一样。</p><p>最让我失望的，其实还是陈春成。我读过他的《夜晚的潜水艇》，惊为天人，还写过读后感。在那本书里，陈春成写的很多故事都让我误以为他和双雪涛一样，对于现实，牢骚满腹，却只能和着血吞。不信你看看，他在《裁云记》里讲说某个城市因为元首的一句玩笑话说云彩破破烂烂，城市管理者立马成立了《云彩管理局》，随时修剪云彩。他在《音乐家》里，讲了个苏联故事，一位克格勃的音乐审查员，本身拥有天才的创作能力，但一直被恐惧压制，直到有一天，他「感到灵魂中激起一圈圈波纹，应和着乐声，漩动成涡流，不知要往哪倾泻……」，他决定放飞自我，成为一只椋鸟。</p><blockquote><p>说是上帝每造出一只椋鸟，就造出一段旋律，和它灵魂的形状完全一致，藏在世间某处，让这鸟去寻找。也许在泉流中，也许在树梢的摇荡中，也许正盘旋在某个人的脑子里。椋鸟终日乱叫，探索着新的调子，也学它听来的任何声音，就是为找它的旋律。一旦被它偶然唱出，椋鸟的形体就会立时化作灰烬，而它的灵魂就钻进那旋律里，再也不出来了……</p></blockquote><p>陈春成是 90 年生人，《夜晚的潜水艇》是他迄今为止唯一出版物。读完之后，我一直期待他的新作，直到昨天。</p><p>我猜，一个需要整天打卡「学习强国」挣学分的人，是很难写出飘逸文字，也很难再成为椋鸟了。就算有天他写出同样的故事来，也好像没办法说服我了。</p><p>有个词想送给陈春成：英年早事。</p><p></p><pre><code>陈春成作品弹幕：</code></pre><blockquote><p>上头希望借助你的力量，复原《红楼梦》，当然要在尽量保持作品原貌的同时加以修正，去其糟粕，注入新时代的正能量。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>我断断续续念了出来：揭示了腐朽的封建社会必然灭亡的命运……</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>「《红楼梦》没有中心思想，因为它就是一切的中心；也无法从中提取出意义，因为它本身就是宇宙的意义。」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>红学会将二者的理论与对《红楼梦》的崇拜融合起来，形成了他们的教义：他们相信宇宙的意义就是《红楼梦》。教义宣称，冥冥中有一条引线，由所有人的命运共同编织而成，它从天地开辟前的混沌中发端，隐秘地盘绕在万事万物之间，千秋万载地延伸。创世之初它就被点燃，火星不断向前推进，穿过历朝历代，一直烧到《红楼梦》完成的那一刻（他们称之为红点），然后，轰隆，宇宙达到最辉煌灿烂的顶点。此后就是漫长的下坡、缓慢的衰亡：《红楼梦》一完成便开始流逝，到它彻底消失时，宇宙亦将随之泯灭。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>袭春寒告诉过我，全球的天空上逡巡着万千青鸟，它们监控一切，也是极具杀伤力的武器；在城市上空还作为移动广播，时刻宣传焦大同的丰功伟绩。</p></blockquote>

However, he was limited by the two-dimensional realm, and many concepts couldn't be fully translated onto paper.</p><p>(§ 22 How I then tried to diffuse the Theory of Three Dimensions by other means, and of the result)</p><blockquote><p>So I devoted several months in privacy to the composition of a treatise on the mysteries of Three Dimensions. Only, with the view of evading the Law, if possible, I spoke not of a physical Dimension, but of a Thoughtland whence, in theory, a Figure could look down upon Flatland and see simultaneously the insides of all things, and where it was possible that there might be supposed to exist a Figure environed, as it were, with six Squares, and containing eight terminal Points. But in writing this book I found myself sadly hampered by the impossibility of drawing such diagrams as were necessary for my purpose: for of course, in our country of Flatland, there are no tablets but Lines, and no diagrams but Lines, all in one straight Line and only distinguishable by difference of size and brightness; so that, when I had finished my treatise (which I entitled, 「Through Flatland to Thoughtland」) I could not feel certain that many would understand my meaning.</p></blockquote><p>A-Square repackaged certain three-dimensional concepts using two-dimensional language, presenting them in a way that seemed less risky and easily understandable, yet not completely devoid of their original meaning.</p><p>However, A-Square still felt that writing constrained his expression, and he was uncertain if people would accurately grasp some of his intended meanings.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/3ddac58a-e796-428d-ab54-1a2dc2b867a4.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Zeal</strong></h3><p>Despite A-Square's intention to maintain a low profile and silently spread the gospel, he inadvertently exposed his dangerous thoughts.</p><p>(§ 22 How I then tried to diffuse the Theory of Three Dimensions by other means, and of the result)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart">And yet at times my spirit was too strong for me, and I gave vent to dangerous utterances.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Already I was considered heterodox if not treasonable, and I was keenly alive to the danger of my position; nevertheless I could not at times refrain from bursting out into suspicious or half-seditious utterances, even among the highest Polygonal or Circular society.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When, for example, the question arose about the treatment of those lunatics who said that they had received the power of seeing the insides of things, I would quote the saying of an ancient Circle, who declared that prophets and inspired people are always considered by the majority to be mad; and I could not help occasionally dropping such expressions as 「the eye that discerns the interiors of things,」 and 「the all-seeing land」; once or twice I even let fall the forbidden terms 「the Third and Fourth Dimensions.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>At last, to complete a series of minor indiscretions, at a meeting of our Local Speculative Society held at the palace of the Prefect himself,—some extremely silly person having read an elaborate paper exhibiting the precise reasons why Providence has limited the number of Dimensions to Two, and why the attribute of omnividence is assigned to the Supreme alone—I so far forgot myself as to give an exact account of the whole of my voyage with the Sphere into Space, and to the Assembly Hall in our Metropolis, and then to Space again, and of my return home, and of everything that I had seen and heard in fact or vision.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>At first, indeed, I pretended that I was describing the imaginary experiences of a fictitious person; but my enthusiasm soon forced me to throw off all disguise, and finally, in a fervent peroration, I exhorted all my hearers to divest themselves of prejudice and to become believers in the Third Dimension.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>And then, as expected, A-Square was imprisoned.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/4b4778ca-4306-4214-b167-b974dc1a6c4b.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p></p><h3>The Memoir</h3><p>In prison, A-Square encountered his own brother. Despite A-Square's brother witnessing the entire process of the sphere's "coming" and subsequently being silenced and imprisoned, he still doubted everything A-Square said. This caused great anguish for A-Square.</p><p>(§ 22 How I then tried to diffuse the Theory of Three Dimensions by other means, and of the result)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart">My brother is one of the best of Squares, just, sensible, cheerful, and not without fraternal affection; yet I confess that my weekly interviews, at least in one respect, cause me the bitterest pain.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He was present when the Sphere manifested himself in the Council Chamber; he saw the Sphere’s changing sections; he heard the explanation of the phenomena then give to the Circles. Since that time, scarcely a week has passed during seven whole years, without his hearing from me a repetition of the part I played in that manifestation, together with ample descriptions of all the phenomena in Spaceland, and the arguments for the existence of Solid things derivable from Analogy.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yet—I take shame to be forced to confess it—my brother has not yet grasped the nature of Three Dimensions, and frankly avows his disbelief in the existence of a Sphere.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>With no other activities to engage in within the confines of the prison, A-Square began writing his memoir. <strong>This memoir is what we know as "Flatland," the book we are familiar with.</strong></p><p>(§ 22 How I then tried to diffuse the Theory of Three Dimensions by other means, and of the result)</p><blockquote><p></p><p>Hence I am absolutely destitute of converts, and, for aught that I can see, the millennial Revelation has been made to me for nothing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Prometheus (Προμηθεύς = forethought) </strong>up in Spaceland was bound for bringing down fire for mortals, but I—poor Flatland Prometheus—lie here in prison for bringing down nothing to my countrymen. <strong>Yet I existing the hope that these memoirs, in some manner, I know not how, may find their way to the minds of humanity in Some Dimension, and may stir up a race of rebels who shall refuse to be confined to limited Dimensionality.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>That is the hope of my brighter moments. Alas, it is not always so. Heavily weights on me at times the burdensome reflection that I cannot honestly say I am confident as to the exact shape of the once-seen, oft-regretted Cube; and in my nightly visions the mysterious precept, 「Upward, not Northward,」 haunts me like a soul-devouring Sphinx.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is part of the martyrdom which I endure for the cause of Truth that there are seasons of mental weakness, when Cubes and Spheres flit away into the background of scarce-possible existences; when the Land of Three Dimensions seems almost as visionary as the Land of One or None; nay, when even this hard wall that bars me from my freedom, these very tablets on which I am writing, and all the substantial realities of Flatland itself, appear no better than the offspring of a diseased imagination, or the baseless fabric of a dream.</p><p></p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/63b625d6-68a6-4489-9997-717d38668163.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Thus concludes A-Square's memoir. This is the story that was published as "Flatland" in 1884.</p><p>The traveler snapped out of his reverie and refocused his attention on the elder's narration of the town's past.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/8e135eba-e1f2-4025-80cf-d1d7e7ad41a2.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Traveler's Question</strong></h3><p>Coming back to his senses, the traveler heard the old man say that the girl had grown up. While her mathematical abilities hadn't advanced significantly, her achievements in music and literature had grown increasingly refined. The townspeople adored her singing and piano performances, and the couple, along with their little daughter, experienced a truly blessed time.</p><p>Regrettably, shortly after the young girl reached adulthood, her father fell victim to an illness, evoking sympathy from the townspeople who mourned the family's loss.</p><p>As the old man carried on recounting the family's history, the traveler couldn't resist interrupting and posing a question that had piqued his curiosity.</p><p><strong>Traveler</strong>: Excuse me, I am intrigued to learn how that girl eventually pursued a path in mathematics and became a mathematician.</p><p><strong>Old man</strong>: That girl became a mathematician?</p><p><strong>Traveler</strong>: Indeed, as it is inscribed on her tombstone. I am genuinely curious about her journey of learning mathematics.</p><p><strong>Old man</strong>: I'm afraid I have to disappoint you, that girl did not become a mathematician in the end.</p><p><strong>Traveler</strong>: I'm perplexed. Why would the girl's tombstone bear the inscription "Mathematician Daughter ▲," while her parents' tombstones are marked with "Mathematician's Father ◭" and "Mathematician's Mother ◮"?</p><p><strong>Old man</strong>: That's a misconception, and it relates to the tragedy that befell the family later on.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/80303671-079f-4a78-8b0e-56a47817cb47.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Choice</strong></h3><p>The old man hesitated briefly, seemingly contemplating where to commence his memory.</p><p>The little daughter of that family was optimistic by nature. Besides her love for music and mathematics, she sometimes went to a nearby town to help at an orphanage, where she would teach the children to write, read, and of course, music.</p><p>In a certain year, rumors spread of a colossal war, unprecedented in history, which had broken out. Perplexingly, no one beyond the town could offer a clear explanation for its cause.</p><p>Some attributed it to a fierce conflict over valuable minerals, while others pointed to a contentious issue of noble inheritance. Yet, there were those who believed that the primary catalyst lay in a religious conflict, as only such a profound dispute could mobilize such a vast number of people.</p><p>It was rumored that this war, ignited by factions within the same religion, stemmed from a dispute over the translation of a single word in the scripture. One faction advocated for translating the word as "this," while the opposing faction insisted on translating it as "that." Remarkably, this seemingly innocent word carried a profound connotation of "up."</p><p>Neither side could sway the other, and the contentious debate persisted for countless years, accumulating sporadic vendettas and an array of conflicts. Interests clashed, political calculations intertwined, ultimately culminating in the outbreak of a massive war.</p><p>Countless lives were lost, fields transformed into desolate wastelands, and cities reduced to ruins.</p><p>Fortunately, owing to the town's strategic insignificance, the immediate vicinity remained relatively tranquil and unscathed by the ravages of war, allowing life to continue undisturbed.</p><p>The little daughter of that family, as usual, hummed her favorite song to the orphanage to teach the children music.</p><p>As the old man recounted this, he let out a sigh and uttered, "Disaster! What a disaster!"</p><p>It remains unknown which side's deserters, seeking to exploit the vulnerability of the poorly guarded orphanage, intended to pillage it. Their aim was to steal food, appropriate donations, and even abduct the children to sell them elsewhere. In the face of these thugs, the head of the orphanage bravely confronted them, instructing the girl from that family to lead the children and escape to the nearby town.</p><p>The head of the orphanage engaged in a fierce struggle with the deserters, inflicting injuries, but eventually succumbing and falling in a pool of blood, sacrificing his life for the children's sake.</p><p>The girl ran alongside the children, urging them not to look back, but to keep running until they reached the safety of the town. Even while fleeing, she valiantly fought back the pursuers with stones strewn along the path.</p><p>In her brave defense, she gravely wounded one of the deserters, further enraging the remaining accomplices. Though their anger stemmed not from the impending demise of their comrade, but from the audacity of a seemingly feeble entity daring to resist them. Yet, amidst their fury, they couldn't help but experience a tinge of schadenfreude—relishing the fact that there was now one less person to share their ill-gotten gains.</p><p>The pursuers harbored a delusion, believing that chasing after a young girl was an easier path to survival than going to battle, and that it would yield greater rewards. If stones were thrown, surely their unfortunate accomplice would bear the brunt, skillfully dodging any incoming projectiles.</p><p>To their astonishment, the stones wielded by the girl proved far more perilous than they had imagined. Each stone followed a destined parabolic trajectory, converging precisely on moving heads, claiming the lives of two more pursuers. In their foolishness, the remaining individuals hastily wrapped whatever they could find around their heads in a futile attempt to shield their most rational part. Panicking and with obstructed vision, they stumbled one after another while giving chase, their pace slowed to a crawl, unable to keep up with the agile girl.</p><p>The girl herself sustained injuries, her clothes drenched in blood. When she finally reached the nearby town with the children, her strength waned, her complexion turned ashen, and she collapsed onto the ground, unconscious.</p><p>The townspeople who arrived to offer assistance were relieved to find no sign of the pursuing thugs, as they surely would not dare attack a densely populated town.</p><p>They did their utmost to save her, staunching her bleeding and keeping a vigil by her bedside. However, before the dawn of the new day, the girl departed from this world.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/077475d8-741d-4ba3-9ea3-6d609006d8ac.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Mother's Question</strong></h3><p>The news of the girl's death spread back to the town where she grew up, leaving behind one mother whose face was constantly wet with tears.</p><p>"My daughter! My dear, foolish daughter! My dear, foolish daughter!"</p><p>Those who came to offer solace and support could only hear the echoes of this grieving mother's repeated sobs. She had no other words to express her pain, only tears streaming down her face. The separation from her daughter was tormenting her like a heart-wrenching pain, her soul was screaming silently.</p><p>For several days, the mother remained immersed in profound grief, barely eating, and surviving on little more than a sip of water. Not sleeping much, most of the time sitting by the window, as if she could still see her little daughter playing spinning under the night sky in front of her, hearing her daughter's piano and singing, sorrow catalyzed the whitening of her hair, the people who came could clearly see her accelerated aging, the whole person seemed to have lost the breath of the soul, the successive deaths of her husband and daughter caused her a heavy blow.</p><p>The mother was not just sitting idly, alongside reminiscing about the cherished moments spent with her husband and daughter, she pondered several questions, "The priests spoke of heaven and another world. Are my husband and daughter in heaven? Is my daughter happy there? Can my daughter sing in heaven?"</p><p>On one night, after sitting for half a day, the mother finally couldn't withstand the fatigue and closed her eyes to sleep.</p><p>In her dream, she saw a point of light, which seemed to be infinitely far away, and was separated from her by a vague human figure. She felt a deep awe.</p><p>The mother asked the questions she had been wanting to ask.</p><p><strong>The Mother</strong>: May I ask if my daughter has arrived in heaven? Is she happy there?</p><p><strong>Human Figure</strong>: Your daughter is an excellent mathematician. Her soul (ψυχή) beautiful (καλός), logical (λογος), miraculous (θαύμα), happy (ευδαιμονία).</p><p>Upon hearing the words of the ethereal figure, she was overcome with ecstasy, weeping and laughing in her dream, as if her soul was no longer torn asunder.</p><p><strong>Human figure</strong>: Your soul (ψυχή) beautiful (καλός), logical (λογος), happy (ευδαιμονία). You are also a mathematician.</p><p>The mother no longer comprehended the figure's words in her dream. She only recalled that her daughter was blissful in heaven, and a profound sense of relief washed over her.</p><p>In her understanding, her daughter had reached heaven, and was very happy in heaven. Her dear little daughter even became the mathematician she dreamed of becoming.</p><p>The only peculiarity was that the "angel" had referred to her as a mathematician as well. The mother attributed it to her old age and possible confusion, believing that the "angel" had intended to say she was the mother of her beautiful, logical, and happy mathematician daughter.</p><p>She harbored no doubt about the reality of her dream. Everything felt vivid and tangible. she firmly believed that her beloved daughter resided in a state of blissful existence within the realms of heaven.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/d0b32aa0-4e1f-43f5-ac9f-778b233120b4.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Tombstone Inscriptions</strong></h3><p>Following that fateful night, the mother underwent a profound transformation. Gone were the days of sorrow and tears. The very next morning, she hurried to her daughter's tombstone and engraved the words <strong>"Mathematician Daughter ▲"</strong> beneath her name.</p><p>Concern spread among the townsfolk, wondering if she had succumbed to delirium or madness due to overwhelming grief.</p><p>She took the time to explain to familiar faces in the town everything she had experienced and witnessed in her dream. She declared, "My daughter has reached heaven and become the mathematician she aspired to be. I am at peace."</p><p>Some townspeople chose to believe her, offering heartfelt gratitude to a higher power. "Thank God! Thank God! Thank God!" they exclaimed.</p><p>Others harbored doubts, perceiving the elderly woman's mental state as fragile but kindly refrained from disputing her claims.</p><p>A few remained skeptical, acknowledging that her daughter's ascension to heaven seemed plausible - after all, she was such a virtuous girl - but doubting that her daughter could become a mathematician. They thought it was probably a kind lie from the "angel".</p><p>Still, others thought, "Whether this is true or not, at least this poor woman is no longer washing her face with tears. This is what her husband and daughter would have liked to see."</p><p>Now, only the elderly lady remained in the family within the small town. Her other children implored her to leave and reside with them, assuring her of their care. However, she insisted on staying in the familiar surroundings, finding solace in the support of her neighbors. She longed to accompany her husband and young daughter until the end of her days, believing it would lessen the chances of losing her way to heaven and facilitate a joyful reunion. After all, she was an old lady who struggled to navigate by reading maps.</p><p>Several more years passed, and eventually, the elderly lady, too, passed away.</p><p>In her final moments, those who had been caring for her overheard her whispering, "Am I also a mathematician? Oh, my daughter is the mathematician."</p><p>Upon her demise, the townspeople inscribed the tombstones of both her and her husband: <strong>"Mathematician's Father ◭"</strong> and <strong>"Mathematician's Mother ◮."</strong></p><p>This is the origin of the inscriptions on those three tombstones, providing the answer the stranger sought to uncover.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/dbb643e2-8c16-482a-b440-efd0594a3d1b.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Having attentively absorbed the tale of this family, the traveler conveyed his sincerest gratitude to the elderly narrator, leaving behind a meaningful token of appreciation.</p><p>Prior to departing the small town, the traveler he offered flowers to the family's tombstone.</p><p>His mind drifted to the beginning passage from "<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/201/201-h/201-h.htm">Flatland</a></strong>":</p><blockquote><p>To</p><p>The Inhabitance of SPACE IN GENERAL</p><p>And H.C.

However, the residents of the two-dimensional plane world have very limited possibilities they can perceive; they can only make choices visible within their field of view.</p><p>Although both the "shape-based" and "color-based" philosophies may seem incomplete and destined for disaster, both sides sincerely believe that the philosophy they uphold can solve everything. They fail to realize that both "shape" and "color" are projections of the three-dimensional world onto the two-dimensional plane.</p><p>People in the three-dimensional world know that there is something deeper. The simple pursuit of "shape" or "color" cannot solve the ignorance, problems, and conflicts of the two-dimensional world.</p><p>Three-dimensional observers wonder why two-dimensional people would fight to the death for such incomplete philosophies. In contrast, the residents of the two-dimensional plane world find the speculations of the three-dimensional inhabitants unbelievable, viewing them as either pure fantasies or the whispers of the devil.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/8edb9d62-e1a7-4672-856c-67b015da7642.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>A Square's Visit to the One-Dimensional Linear World</strong></h3><p>On the penultimate day of 1999, A-Square, the protagonist of "Flatland," had a dream.</p><p>In the dream, A Square, being a two-dimensional square, observed a "line space" within an unknown realm. On this "line space," A Square witnessed various line segments.</p><p>(§ 13 How I had a Vision of Lineland)</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f62ac811-c854-4cae-a0c0-3eeb82be0cc2.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In this one-dimensional linear world, the longest line is the king. In this one-dimensional kingdom, length represents the highest value and serves as the foundation of social order.</p><p>Initially, A-Square attempted to have a conversation with the "Line King," but discovered that the "Line King" didn't know where A-Square's voice was coming from. For the king, A-Square's voice originated from an unknown direction (as anything outside the linear space was unknown to the "Line King").</p><p>(§ 13 How I had a Vision of Lineland)</p><blockquote><p>It seemed that this poor ignorant Monarch—as he called himself—was persuaded that the Straight Line which he called his Kingdom, and in which he passed his existence, constituted the whole of the world, and indeed the whole of Space. Not being able either to move or to see, save in his Straight Line, he had no conception of anything out of it. Though he had heard my voice when I first addressed him, the sounds had come to him in a manner so contrary to his experience that he had made no answer, 「seeing no man,」 as he expressed it, 「and hearing a voice as it were from my own intestines.」</p></blockquote><p>From the king's perspective, A-Square's voice seemed to be "emanating from within."</p><p>For a line, the left end and the right end are considered "sides," while everything between the left and right ends is considered <strong>"inside" (εσωτερικός = esoteric = internal)</strong>. And anything that is neither "side" nor "inside" is considered <strong>"outside" (εξωτερικός = exoteric = external)</strong>.</p><p>The king believed that the line space he perceived constituted the entirety of the world.</p><p>(§ 13 How I had a Vision of Lineland)</p><blockquote><p>Until the moment when I placed my mouth in his World, he had neither seen me, nor heard anything except confused sounds beating against, what I called his side, but what he called his <strong>inside</strong> (εσωτερικός = esoteric = internal) or <strong>stomach;</strong> nor had he even now the least conception of the region from which I had come. Outside his World, or Line, all was a blank to him; nay, not even a blank, for a blank implies Space; say, rather, all was non-existent.</p></blockquote><p>In this one-dimensional linear kingdom, auditory perception is the most important distinguishing sense because everyone can only see a single point, similar to how residents of a two-dimensional world perceive only a line.</p><p>(§ 13 How I had a Vision of Lineland)</p><blockquote><p>His subjects—of whom the small Lines were men and the Points Women—were all alike confined in motion and eyesight to that single Straight Line, which was their World. It need scarcely be added that the whole of their horizon was limited to a Point; nor could any one ever see anything but a Point. Man, woman, child, thing—each as a Point to the eye of a Linelander. Only by the sound of the voice could sex or age be distinguished.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/542fee08-a91f-4a2b-ad01-5601edcbe43d.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In A-Square's eyes, the one-dimensional world appeared quite dull, monotonous, and boring. However, he unexpectedly discovered that the king was full of vitality.</p><p>(§ 13 How I had a Vision of Lineland)</p><blockquote><p>Such a life, with all vision limited to a Point, and all motion to a Straight Line, seemed to me inexpressibly dreary; and I was surprised to note that vivacity and cheerfulness of the King. Wondering whether it was possible, amid circumstances so unfavourable to domestic relations, to enjoy the pleasures of conjugal union, I hesitated for some time to question his Royal Highness on so delicate a subject; but at last I plunged into it by abruptly inquiring as to the health of his family. 「My wives and children,」 he replied, 「are well and happy.」</p></blockquote><p>A-Square attempted to explain to the one-dimensional king that in this world, apart from the concepts of north and south, there are also east and west (left and right). However, the one-dimensional king expressed confusion, and their ensuing conversation ended up in communication failure.</p><p>(§ 14 How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart"><strong>King</strong>: 「...though I know not what you mean by ‘right’ and ‘left.’ But I deny that you saw these things. For how could you see the Line, that is to say the inside, of any Man? But you must have heard these things, and then dreamed that you saw them. And let me ask what you mean by those words ‘left’ and ‘right.’ I suppose it is your way of saying Northward and Southward.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>「Not so,」 replied <strong>I</strong>; 「besides your motion of Northward and Southward, there is another motion which I call from right to left.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>King:</strong> Exhibit to me, if you please, this motion from left to right.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I:</strong> Nay, that I cannot do, unless you could step out of your Line altogether.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>King:</strong> Out of my Line? Do you mean out of the world? Out of Space?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I:</strong> Well, yes. Out of <strong>your</strong> world. Out of <strong>your</strong> Space. For your Space is not the true Space. True Space is a Plane; but your Space is only a Line.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>King:</strong> If you cannot indicate this motion from left to right by yourself moving in it, then I beg you to describe it to me in words.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I: </strong>If you cannot tell your right side from your left, I fear that no words of mine can make my meaning clearer to you. But surely you cannot be ignorant of so simple a distinction.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>King</strong>: I do not in the least understand you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Alas! How shall I make it clear? When you move straight on, does it not sometimes occur to you that you <strong>could</strong> move in some other way, turning your eye round so as to look in the direction towards which your side is now fronting? In other words, instead of always moving in the direction of one of your extremities, do you never feel a desire to move in the direction, so to speak, of your side?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>King:</strong> Never. And what do you mean? How can a man’s inside 「front」 in any direction? Or how can a man move in the direction of his inside?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I:</strong> Well then, since words cannot explain the matter, I will try deeds, and will move gradually out of Lineland in the direction which I desire to indicate to you.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/92849a2a-9515-4bbf-a560-1ca399a69250.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When it became apparent that language was completely ineffective and their linguistic systems had non-overlapping realms, A-Square decided to persuade the king through action and tangible "phenomena." A-Square planned to "project" himself into the one-dimensional space, allowing the king to "perceive" his true existence.</p><p>And A-Square succeeded in making the king perceive his "projection."</p><p>(§ 14 How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart">At the word I began to move my body out of Lineland. As long as any part of me remained in his dominion and in his view, the King kept exclaiming, 「I see you, I see you still; you are not moving.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But when I had at last moved myself out of his Line, he cried in his shrillest voice, 「She is vanished; she is dead.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>「I am not dead,」 replied I; 「I am simply out of Lineland, that is to say, out of the Straight Line which you call Space, and in the true Space, where I can see things as they are. And at this moment I can see your Line, or side—or inside as you are pleased to call it; and I can see also the Men and Women on the North and South of you, whom I will now enumerate, describing their order, their size, and the interval between each.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When I had done this at great length, I cried triumphantly, 「Does that at last convince you?」 And, with that, I once more entered Lineland, taking up the same position as before.</p></blockquote><p>A-Square traversing his entire square body along the linear dimension.</p><p>From the king's perception, this action appeared as A-Square "suddenly" appearing and then "suddenly" disappearing, as if he had come and died.</p><p>A-Square believed that by accomplishing this "miracle," he could make the king believe. However, he didn't anticipate the deep-rooted inertia of the king's worldview. The king simply regarded A-Square as a demon or an evil entity.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/be12e43a-9799-4e7a-9df2-ce1698b943d3.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The king's "linear rationality" led him to reach a "clear" conclusion: A-Square did not actually move but rather employed magical tricks of disappearance and reappearance. The king believed that the "new world" proclaimed by A-Square did not exist.</p><p>Upon hearing this, A-Square became angry.</p><p>(§ 14 How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland)</p><blockquote><p>Furious at his perversity, and especially indignant that he professed to be ignorant of my sex, I retorted in no measured terms, 「Besotted Being! You think yourself the perfection of existence, while you are in reality the most imperfect and imbecile. You profess to see, whereas you see nothing but a Point! You plume yourself on inferring the existence of a Straight Line; but I <strong>can see</strong> Straight Lines, and infer the existence of Angles, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and even Circles. Why waste more words? Suffice it that I am the completion of your incomplete self. You are a Line, but I am a Line of Lines called in my country a Square: and even I, infinitely superior though I am to you, am of little account among the great nobles of Flatland, whence I have come to visit you, in the hope of enlightening your ignorance.」</p></blockquote><p>A-Square's arrogance successfully provoked the anger of the one-dimensional king, who attempted to attack A-Square.</p><p>(§ 14 How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland)</p><blockquote><p>Hearing these words the King advanced towards me with a menacing cry as if to pierce me through the diagonal; and in that same movement there arose from myriads of his subjects a multitudinous war-cry, increasing in vehemence till at last methought it rivalled the roar of an army of a hundred thousand Isosceles, and the artillery of a thousand Pentagons. Spell-bound and motionless, I could neither speak nor move to avert the impending destruction; and still the noise grew louder, and the King came closer, when I awoke to find the breakfast-bell recalling me to the realities of Flatland.</p></blockquote><p>And then A-Square's dream ended.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/33ee342c-6974-442a-bcc8-64456d52efd2.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Visitor from the three-dimensional space</strong></h3><p>On the day following A-Square's dream visit to the one-dimensional world, he encountered a visitor from the three-dimensional space.</p><p>(§ 15 Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>It was the last day of our 1999th year of our era. The patterning of the rain had long ago announced nightfall; and I was sitting in the company of my wife, musing on the events of the past and the prospects of the coming year, the coming century, the coming Millennium.</p></blockquote><p>In the house where A-Square resides, a strange sound appeared, along with the appearance of a "person," which greatly frightened A-Square and his wife.</p><p>(§ 15 Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>My Wife as well as myself heard the words, although she did not understand their meaning, and both of us sprang forward in the direction of the sound. What was our horror when we saw before us a Figure! At the first glance it appeared to be a Woman, seen sideways; but a moment’s observation shewed me that the extremities passed into dimness too rapidly to represent one of the Female Sex; and I should have thought it a Circle, only that it seemed to change its size in a manner impossible for a Circle or for any regular Figure of which I had had experience.</p></blockquote><p>After A-Square asked his wife to leave, he recognized the unfamiliar visitor as a "<strong>Circle</strong>," one of the most respected entities in his society.</p><p>(§ 15 Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>then, suddenly recoiling, 「Oh! it is not a Woman, and there are no angles either, not a trace of one. Can it be that I have so misbehaved to a perfect Circle?」</p></blockquote><p>The unfamiliar visitor spoke enigmatic words.</p><p>(§ 15 Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>「I am indeed, in a certain sense a Circle,」 replied the Voice, 「and a more perfect Circle than any in Flatland; but to speak more accurately, I am many Circles in one.」 ...... I glanced at the half-hour glass. The last sands had fallen. The third Millennium had begun.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b662e466-249a-4d4b-b5a0-98a3b995385e.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When this unfamiliar Sphere "descends" into the two-dimensional space where A-Square resides, he perceives it as a Circle based on his experience and knowledge.</p><p>The perception of the Circle by A-Square is the two-dimensional <strong>cross-section</strong> of the "sphere" in the flat plane.</p><p>What A-Square's sensory eyes perceive is the one-dimensional projection of this sphere's two-dimensional cross-section.</p><p>Through a perceptive interpretation of this one-dimensional projection, A-Square concludes that he sees a two-dimensional "Circle."</p><p>(§ 16 How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>There was not the trace of an angle, not the slightest roughness or inequality: never in my life had I met with a more perfect Circle. He remained motionless while I walked around him, beginning from his eye and returning to it again. Circular he was throughout, a perfectly satisfactory Circle; there could not be a doubt of it.</p></blockquote><p></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f3c7dc3e-1500-4f65-b189-8fa12552e346.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/2b74dceb-d4c9-47ec-b438-3f1f161951fc.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Revelation of the Three-Dimensional Visitor</strong></h3><p>A-Square witnessed the appearance of a stranger in his house, and the "roundness" of this unfamiliar individual surpassed any approximations to roundness he had ever encountered. In A-Square's worldview and value system, approaching roundness was synonymous with nobility, leading him to hold deep respect and admiration for the visitor.</p><p>(§ 16 How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>Then followed a dialogue, which I will endeavour to set down as near as I can recollect it, omitting only some of my profuse apologies—for I was covered with shame and humiliation that I, a Square, should have been guilty of the impertinence of feeling a Circle. It was commenced by the Stranger with some impatience at the lengthiness of my introductory process.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. Have you felt me enough by this time? Are you not introduced to me yet?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Most illustrious Sir, excuse my awkwardness, which arises not from ignorance of the usages of polite society, but from a little surprise and nervousness, consequent on this somewhat unexpected visit. And I beseech you to reveal my indiscretion to no one, and especially not to my Wife. But before your Lordship enters into further communications, would he deign to satisfy the curiosity of one who would gladly know whence his visitor came?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. From Space, from Space, Sir: whence else?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Pardon me, my Lord, but is not your Lordship already in Space, your Lordship and his humble servant, even at this moment?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. Pooh! what do you know of Space? Define Space.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Space, my Lord, is height and breadth indefinitely prolonged.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. Exactly: you see you do not even know what Space is. You think it is of Two Dimensions only; but I have come to announce to you a Third—height, breadth, and length.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>A-Square and the Three-Dimensional Spherical Visitor repeated, in a certain form, the interaction process A-Square had with the One-Dimensional King the previous day. The Three-Dimensional Visitor attempted to explain the existence of the "third dimension - height" to A-Square, but he couldn't grasp it entirely.</p><p>What exactly is "height"? &nbsp;A-Square remained completely unable to comprehend.</p><p>(§ 16 How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart"><strong>I</strong>. Your Lordship is pleased to be merry. We also speak of length and height, or breadth and thickness, thus denoting Two Dimensions by four names.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. But I mean not only three names, but Three Dimensions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Would your Lordship indicate or explain to me in what direction is the Third Dimension, unknown to me?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. I came from it. It is up above and down below.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. My Lord means seemingly that it is Northward and Southward.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. I mean nothing of the kind. I mean a direction in which you cannot look, because you have no eye in your side.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Pardon me, my Lord, a moment’s inspection will convince your Lordship that I have a perfectly luminary at the juncture of my two sides.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. Yes: but in order to see into Space you ought to have an eye, not on your Perimeter, but on your side, that is, on what you would probably call your inside; but we in Spaceland should call it your side.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. An eye in my inside! An eye in my stomach! Your Lordship jests.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. I am in no jesting humour. I tell you that I come from Space, or, since you will not understand what Space means, from the Land of Three Dimensions whence I but lately looked down upon your Plane which you call Space forsooth. From that position of advantage I discerned all that you speak of as <strong>solid</strong> (by which you mean 「enclosed on four sides」), your houses, your churches, your very chests and safes, yes even your insides and stomachs, all lying open and exposed to my view.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>The topic of "lateral" and <strong>"inside"</strong><strong>(εσωτερικός = esoteric = internal) </strong>reappeared in a different form during the conversation between A-Square and the Spherical Visitor.</p><p>And so, the two continued their futile communication across dimensions.</p><p>(§ 16 How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p></p><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. No, indeed. By 「height」 I mean a Dimension like your length: only, with you, 「height」 is not so easily perceptible, being extremely small.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. My Lord, your assertion is easily put to the test. You say I have a Third Dimension, which you call 「height.」 Now, Dimension implies direction and measurement. Do but measure my 「height,」 or merely indicate to me the direction in which my 「height」 extends, and I will become your convert. Otherwise, your Lordship’s own understand must hold me excused.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>Just as the "linear rationality" of the one-dimensional king could not understand A-Square's revelation, A-Square's "planar rationality" could not comprehend the revelation of a sphere with a higher dimension than him.</p><p>After a round of ineffective persuasion, the Sphere decided to perform a "miracle". The Sphere moved its body to "penetrate" the plane where A Square was located. In A Square's vision, the Sphere "shrunk" and then "disappeared", yet A Square could still hear the Sphere's voice from "inside his body".</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/90c6d6b8-3722-49e9-babc-14d1738baead.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>(§ 16 How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>But to me, proficient though I was in <strong>Flatland</strong><strong>Mathematics</strong>, it was by no means a simple matter. The rough diagram given above will make it clear to any Spaceland child that the Sphere, ascending in the three positions indicated there, must needs have manifested himself to me, or to any Flatlander, as a Circle, at first of full size, then small, and at last very small indeed, approaching to a Point. But to me, although I saw the facts before me, the causes were as dark as ever. All that I could comprehend was, that the Circle had made himself smaller and vanished, and that he had now re-appeared and was rapidly making himself larger.</p></blockquote><p>After the Sphere demonstrated the "miracle", A-Square was still deeply confused. Therefore, like Socrates, the Sphere performed a round of "geometric knowledge midwifery" on A-Square, starting from a point to deduce a line, from a line to a plane, and then trying to deduce three dimensions from the characteristics of a plane.</p><p>But the Sphere failed. A-Square did not believe in the results of mathematical deduction under rational <strong>Logic(Λογος)</strong>. The deduced result was too bizarre, too crazy, too abnormal, and too unacceptable for A-Square. So A-Square went mad.</p><p>(§ 16 How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>「Monster,」 I shrieked, 「be thou juggler, enchanter, dream, or devil, no more will I endure thy mockeries. Either thou or I must perish.」 And saying these words I precipitated myself upon him.</p></blockquote><p>Then A Square launched an attack on the revealer.</p><p>(§ 17 How the Sphere, having in vain tried words, resorted to deeds)</p><blockquote><p>It was in vain. I brought my hardest right angle into violent collision with the Stranger, pressing on him with a force sufficient to have destroyed any ordinary Circle: but I could feel him slowly and unarrestably slipping from my contact; not edging to the right nor to the left, but moving somehow out of the world, and vanishing into nothing.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/6c0b25c0-a0b9-47af-bc60-c74e30b41f54.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>A Messenger from Heaven Brings the Three-Dimensional Gospel of the Millennium, but the Chosen Apostle Goes Mad</strong></h3><p>The Sphere felt a sense of disappointment. The Sphere had expected that A-Square, being a relatively fair person and mathematician, would accept the results of its logical deductions despite the limitations in their worldview, flaws, and prejudices. However, A-Square chose to place belief in the one-dimensional projection that his eyes could perceive.</p><p>In the three-dimensional society, there is a rule that every 1,000 years, a <strong>messenger (άγγελος = angel)</strong> is sent to reveal the truth of the three dimensions to the people of the two-dimensional society.</p><p>However, as the new millennium began, the path of preaching faced a significant setback. The three-dimensional <strong>gospel (ευαγγέλιο = ευ + άγγελος = good news)</strong> could not be effectively transmitted.</p><p>The chosen <strong>apostle (απόστολος = one with a mission)</strong>, despite possessing the ability for mathematical logic deduction, refused to accept the results of rational deduction.</p><p>Upon receiving the revelation, the apostle deemed it a bizarre vision and madly attacked the messenger from "heaven".</p><p>(§ 17 How the Sphere, having in vain tried words, resorted to deeds)</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sphere</strong>. Why will you refuse to listen to reason? I had hoped to find in you—as being a man of sense and an accomplished mathematician—a fit apostle for the Gospel of the Three Dimensions, which I am allowed to preach once only in a thousand years: but now I know not how to convince you.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0a62aa55-f544-423e-b3b5-7f1c504634b5.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Three-Dimensional Perspective is Not Omniscient</strong></h3><p>After a series of futile demonstrations of "miracles," the Sphere became desperate. It decided to forcefully "shake" A-Square out of his familiar two-dimensional plane, allowing his eyes to "witness" the "three-dimensional gospel".</p><p>(§ 17 How the Sphere, having in vain tried words, resorted to deeds)</p><blockquote><p>「Fool! Madman! Irregular!」 I exclaimed; 「never will I release thee; thou shalt pay the penalty of thine impostures.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>「Ha! Is it come to this?」 thundered the Stranger: 「then meet your fate: out of your Plane you go. Once, twice, thrice! ’Tis done!」</p></blockquote><p>Once "shaken" out of the two-dimensional plane, A-Square finally understood the Sphere's Revelation and what the "three-dimensional gospel" meant.</p><p>(§ 18 How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there)</p><blockquote><p>I looked, and, behold, a new world! There stood before me, visibly incorporate, all that I had before inferred, conjectured, dreamed, of perfect Circular beauty. What seemed the centre of the Stranger’s form lay open to my view: yet I could see no heart, lungs, nor arteries, only a beautiful harmonious Something—for which I had no words; but you, my Readers in Spaceland, would call it the surface of the Sphere.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>......</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once more I felt myself rising through space. It was even as the Sphere had said. The further we receded from the object we beheld, the larger became the field of vision. My native city, with the interior of every house and every creature therein, lay open to my view in miniature. We mounted higher, and lo, the secrets of the earth, the depths of the mines and inmost caverns of the hills, were bared before me.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ae33d39b-41de-466a-914c-a7769650a081.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>A-Square thought that witnessing such an incredible spectacle was the manifestation of the "omniscience" and "omnipotence" of "God."</p><p>However, A-Square's thoughts were refuted by the Sphere.</p><p>(§ 18 How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart">Awestruck at the sight of the <strong>mysteries (μυστήρια)</strong> of the earth, thus unveiled before my unworthy eye, I said to my Companion, 「Behold, I am become as a God. For the wise men in our country say that to see all things, or as they express it, <strong>omnividence</strong>, is the attribute of God alone.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There was something of scorn in the voice of my Teacher as he made answer: 「is it so indeed? Then the very pick-pockets and cut-throats of my country are to be worshipped by your wise men as being Gods: for there is not one of them that does not see as much as you see now. But trust me, your wise men are wrong.」</p><p></p></blockquote><p>In the Sphere's view, the vision of the three-dimensional world is neither omniscient nor omnipotent. The vision of the three-dimensional world simply knows more relative to the two-dimensional vision. People in the three-dimensional world can overlook all the details of the two-dimensional plane at any time, but this does not mean that the three-dimensional world is full of good and righteous people. The residents of the three dimensions are just aware of more possibilities.</p><p>The vision of the three dimensions does not equate to the <strong>Good (ἀγαθός)</strong> vision. The three dimensions simply see more than the two dimensions and are aware of more possibilities.</p><p>Just as the two dimensions easily see what the one dimension cannot see, it does not mean that A- Square in the two dimensions is a god. However, if A-Square wishes, he can pretend to be a "god" in the one-dimensional world. This is the information advantage of two-dimensional logic over one-dimensional rationality.</p><p>(§ 18 How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there)</p><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Then is omnividence the attribute of others besides Gods?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Sphere</strong>. I do not know. But, if a pick-pocket or a cut-throat of our country can see everything that is in your country, surely that is no reason why the pick-pocket or cut-throat should be accepted by you as a God. This omnividence, as you call it—it is not a common word in Spaceland—does it make you more <strong>Just (δικαιοσύνη) </strong>, more merciful, less selfish, more <strong>Loving (caritas)</strong>? Not in the least. Then how does it make you more <strong>Divine (άγιος)</strong>?</p><p></p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/eb45e2d0-997a-4095-93bd-f8c6321fd8da.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Order, State, and the Messenger's Predicament</strong></h3><p>After the Sphere revealed its Revelation to A-Square, it brought A-Square to the political core of the two-dimensional Flatland world.</p><p>This was the beginning of the new millennium, the first day of the year 2000, when national leaders were gathered together in a meeting.</p><p>At the meeting, the ruler of Flatland announced that at the beginning of every millennium, there would be subjects who fell into illusions, claiming to have received revelations from "heaven" and spreading words about the "existence of a three-dimensional world", "a dimension beyond length and width", and "a new world", thereby bewitching the public, poisoning the minds and souls of young people, corrupting the morals of society, and endangering the order of the state.</p><p>Thus, the Circles instructed a strict search for these lost individuals.</p><p>After witnessing this, the Sphere, like its predecessors, "descended" to the political core of Flatland and declared the existence of three-dimensional space to the priests.</p><p>The Chief Circle and other top rulers were not surprised by the sudden appearance of a stranger, as such things had happened in history and there were records of these events.</p><p>(§ 18 How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there)</p><blockquote><p>「My Lords,」 said the President to the Junior Circles of the Council, 「there is not the slightest need for surprise; the secret archives, to which I alone have access, tell me that a similar occurrence happened on the last two millennial commencements. You will, of course, say nothing of these trifles outside the Cabinet.」</p></blockquote><p>The Chief Circle ordered silence and locked up all the lower-ranking individuals present.</p><p>A-Square's brother was also present. He was a square clerk, so he was also locked up.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0bfef0f2-e5b1-40ce-8efc-530a6397419e.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Projection, Analogy, Logic</strong></h3><p>After the Sphere completed its "descent" and "revelation," it continued to impart knowledge to A-Square about three-dimensional space, including the understanding of light rays, shadows, and perspectives.</p><p>Through these teachings, A-Square fell into a kind of intoxicated joy, because he realized that, according to the <strong>logic (λόγος)</strong> of <strong>analogy (αναλογία)</strong>, above the "three-dimensional space", there might exist a "four-dimensional space".</p><p>To A-Square, the Sphere was so learned and capable, a high-dimensional existence, that it must understand his logic and have the ability to show A-Square the grandeur of the four-dimensional space.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this move by A-Square angered the Sphere messenger. The Sphere thought that A Square's logic was nonsense, as it had never seen another dimension beyond the three-dimensional space.</p><p>After some twists and turns, they visited the zero-dimensional world. In the zero-dimensional world, there is only one point, one existence, and no one else outside of that zero-dimensional existence. It thinks it is the world and doesn't know there is a broader existence.</p><p>After visiting the zero dimension, the Sphere admitted to its student that there is indeed the possibility of the existence of four-dimensional space.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/c4328907-4206-4544-a1fa-05da9df29b82.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/4d35c96f-78a2-48d0-a0a0-2d07aaa9bcd5.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The traveler passing through the town remembered that Charles Howard Hinton [19] was the one who named the hypercube as a tesseract, and he wrote a book called The Fourth Dimension [20].</p><p>Dionys Burger wrote a book inspired by "Flatland" called "Sphereland" [21].</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/5d737fed-2e37-46df-a523-7b8b2012b307.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9902bbba-8229-497b-a5bb-f1586137052c.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Three-Dimensional Gospel of the Two-Dimensional Apostle: Upward, Not Northward!</strong></h3><p>After experiencing numerous inexplicable revelations, A-Square had the confidence to spread the three-dimensional gospel to every corner of the two-dimensional world.</p><p>A-Square condensed the gospel into a single phrase: <strong>"Upward, not Northward!"</strong> The revelation described a new dimension in a direction called <strong>"Up"</strong>, analogous to the two-dimensional world's <strong>"North"</strong>.</p><p>Upon waking up, A-Square overheard the council's proclamation. The council ordered the arrest, imprisonment, or execution of anyone who deceived the people's minds with three-dimensional illusions and claimed to have received revelations from another world.</p><p>This alarmed A-Square, and he decided to start his missionary work with those closest to him. He chose his grandson to be his first disciple of the gospel, as his hexagonal grandson was intelligent and had a keen interest in mathematics.</p><p>As A-Square began explaining the possible existence of the third dimension to his grandson, he heard a directive from the highest level being transmitted.</p><p>(§ 21 How I tried to teach the Theory of Three Dimensions to my Grandson, and with what success)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart">At this moment we heard once more the herald’s 「O yes! O yes!」 outside in the street proclaiming the Resolution of the Council. Young though he was, my Grandson—who was unusually intelligent for his age, and bred up in perfect reverence for the authority of the Circles—took in the situation with an acuteness for which I was quite unprepared. He remained silent till the last words of the Proclamation had died away, and then, bursting into tears, 「Dear Grandpapa,」 he said, 「that was only my fun, and of course I meant nothing at all by it; and we did not know anything then about the new Law; and I don’t think I said anything about the Third Dimension; and I am sure I did not say one word about ‘Upward, not Northward,’ for that would be such nonsense, you know. How could a thing move Upward, and not Northward? Upward and not Northward! Even if I were a baby, I could not be so absurd as that. How silly it is! Ha! ha! ha!」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p><p>「Not at all silly,」 said I, losing my temper; 「here for example, I take this Square,」 and, at the word, I grasped a moveable Square, which was lying at hand—「and I move it, you see, not Northward but—yes, I move it Upward—that is to say, Northward but I move it somewhere—not exactly like this, but somehow—」 Here I brought my sentence to an inane conclusion, shaking the Square about in a purposeless manner, much to the amusement of my Grandson, who burst out laughing louder than ever, and declared that I was not teaching him, but joking with him; and so saying he unlocked the door and ran out of the room. Thus ended my first attempt to convert a pupil to the Gospel of Three Dimensions.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>A-Square's first attempt at missionary work failed.</p><h2><strong>(Mythos Lullaby - Kosmos Flatland - Part II End)</strong></h2><p></p><p></p>

All these sensory stimuli are real, yet there is a significant deviation in the unconscious inference process, where the fragmented "projection" is taken as the complete whole "source," which is a component of projective geometry's work.</p><p>And one day, someone flying in a helicopter above us, observing us on the ground operating a piece of paper as if it were a phone, also becomes entangled in the great confusion of "what is this person on the ground doing."</p><p>The <strong>Hope (Ελπίς)</strong> may lie in the illusion being an incomplete projection.</p><p>The movement and rotation of the projected source will always generate subtle clues. If those who are trapped in the illusion close their eyes, not solely focusing their attention on the projection's appearance, but instead search for abnormal traces in their memories and meticulously calculate the extraordinary deviations from inertia, they might discover a glimmer of light at the exit. They could hear the loud roar of the helicopter above, prompting them to look up, where the possibility of the right angle (ορθή γωνία = right angle = correct angle) lies.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0fc9de23-c0d5-489c-9278-964a245ca6c1.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p></p><h3><strong>Tower of Knowledge in Two-Dimensional Projection</strong></h3><p>The wandering thoughts of the traveler shift from being fixated on the topic of perception to contemplating the depiction of the priestly hierarchy in the story of "Flatland."</p><p>In the two-dimensional plane world, polygons that closely resemble circles constitute the highest hierarchy of social order. The protagonist, A-Square, explains this.</p><p>(§ 11 Concerning our Priests),</p><blockquote><p>When I call them <strong>Priests</strong>, let me not be understood as meaning no more than the term denotes with you. With us, our Priests are Administrators of all Business, <strong>Art</strong>, and <strong>Science</strong>; Directors of Trade, Commerce, Generalship, Architecture, Engineering, Education, Statesmanship, Legislature, Morality, Theology; doing nothing themselves, they are the <strong>Causes </strong>of everything worth doing, that is done by others.</p></blockquote><p>These nearly circular priests are the philosophers, theologians, metaphysicians, and core rulers of the entire society. They are the aristocrats possessing the most "knowledge." They legislate and interpret the <strong>natural law (Ius naturale)</strong> based on their perceptions and strive to learn and uphold it.</p><p>Although these priests are referred to as "circles" in society, everyone knows that no "circle" is truly a "circle"; all "circles" are merely approximations of polygons (300 polygons, 400 polygons, 500 polygons, and so on).</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/c0ee1fc5-19c6-4193-a46e-16c95ca6265e.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Doctrine of Two-Dimensional Projection: Attend to your Configuration</strong></h3><p>The priests' comprehension of <strong>metaphysics (μεταφυσική = μετά + φυσική = beyond physics)</strong> and <strong>natural law (ius naturale)</strong> is transformed and popularized into the doctrines, laws, culture, customs, and all the subtle thoughts and actions of the general public.</p><p>The core doctrine of the social order in the two-dimensional world where A-Square resides is that</p><p>(§ 12 Of the Doctrine of our Priests)</p><blockquote><p>As to the doctrine of the Circles it may briefly be summed up in a single maxim, <strong>「Attend to your Configuration.」</strong> Whether political, ecclesiastical, or moral, all their teaching has for its object the improvement of individual and collective <strong>Configuration</strong>—with special reference of course to the Configuration of the Circles, to which all other objects are subordinated.</p></blockquote><p>That is to say, the highest value in A-Square's society is to strive towards resembling a "Circle" in geometric figures. The regular polygons with a greater number of sides bear a closer resemblance to a "circle". Consequently, a polygon with 12 sides is considered more noble than one with 10 sides, and a polygon with 10 sides is deemed more noble than one with 5 sides.</p><p>The foundation of society is constituted by triangles with 3 sides. These triangles are further divided into equilateral triangles, which bear a stronger resemblance to circles, isosceles triangles at the next level, while other types of triangles are viewed as inferior.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/285de933-263b-4d97-aabd-a7a220215ec4.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>"Round-based and Attend to your Configuration"</strong> is the core value and worldview of the society in which A Square resides. It serves as the foundation for the entire political order.</p><p>There was once a famous philosopher in the two-dimensional plane world. His name was Pantocyclus (panto + cyclus = everywhere is round). The metaphysics of this philosopher can be summarized as,</p><p>(§ 12 Of the Doctrine of our Priests)</p><blockquote><p></p><p>All faults or defects, from the slightest misconduct to the most flagitious crime, Pantocyclus attributed to some deviation from perfect Regularity in the bodily figure, caused perhaps (if not congenital) by some collision in a crowd; by neglect to take exercise, or by taking too much of it; or even by a sudden change of temperature, resulting in a shrinkage or expansion in some too susceptible part of the frame. Therefore, concluded that illustrious Philosopher, neither good conduct nor bad conduct is a fit subject, in any sober estimation, for either praise or blame. <strong>For why should you praise, for example, the integrity of a Square who faithfully defends the interests of his client, when you ought in reality rather to admire the exact precision of his right angles? Or again, why blame a lying, thievish Isosceles, when you ought rather to deplore the incurable inequality of his sides?</strong></p><p></p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/a343b102-3cb9-475c-9e4a-7d9ac4c331c1.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>What the entire society prioritizes the most is the notion of "tending to be round". The value system heavily centers around geometric figures, while placing less emphasis on intangible <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete">virtues (ἀρετή)</a></strong> such as <strong>temperance (σωφροσύνη)</strong>, <strong>courage (ἀνδρεία)</strong>, <strong>justice (δικαιοσύνη)</strong>, <strong>wisdom (σοφία)</strong>, and so forth.</p><p>In the society where A-Square resides, the perception of nobility and <strong>beauty (καλός)</strong> revolves solely around the concept of "tending to be round".</p><p>The society operates in accordance with this order, and it has been functioning since the beginning of time, spanning two millennia (the events in "Flatland" revolve around the past 1999 and the approaching new millennium of 2000).</p><p>Certainly, the doctrine of "Round-based and Attend to your Configuration" occasionally faces challenges when it comes to interpreting reality.</p><p>(§ 12 Of the Doctrine of our Priests)</p><blockquote><p>Theoretically, this doctrine is unquestionable; but it has practical drawbacks. In dealing with an Isosceles, if a rascal pleads that he cannot help stealing because of his unevenness, you reply that for that very reason, because he cannot help being a nuisance to his neighbours, you, the Magistrate, cannot help sentencing him to be consumed—and there’s an end of the matter. But in little domestic difficulties, when the penalty of consumption, or death, is out of the question, this theory of Configuration sometimes comes in awkwardly; and I must confess that occasionally when one of my own Hexagonal Grandsons pleads as an excuse for his disobedience that a sudden change of temperature has been too much for his Perimeter, and that I ought to lay the blame not on him but on his Configuration, which can only be strengthened by abundance of the choicest sweetmeats, I neither see my way logically to reject, nor practically to accept, his conclusions.</p></blockquote><p>A-Square also observed that the upper echelons of his society did not strictly adhere to the most rigid doctrines when it came to educating their children.</p><p>(§ 12 Of the Doctrine of our Priests)</p><blockquote><p>For my own part, I find it best to assume that a good sound scolding or castigation has some latent and strengthening influence on my Grandson’s Configuration; though I own that I have no grounds for thinking so. At all events I am not alone in my way of extricating myself from this dilemma; for I find that many of the highest Circles, sitting as Judges in law courts, use praise and blame towards Regular and Irregular Figures; and in their homes I know by experience that, when scolding their children, they speak about 「right」 and 「wrong」 as vehemently and passionately as if they believe that these names represented real existence, and that a human Figure is really capable of choosing between them.</p></blockquote><p>In A-Square's society, 300 years ago, the ruling priests held the belief that women lacked rationality, leading them to prohibit women from receiving education.</p><blockquote><p>One other word of warning suggest itself to me, though I cannot so easily mention a remedy; and this also refers to our relations with Women. About three hundred years ago, it was decreed by the Chief Circle that, since women are deficient in Reason but abundant in Emotion, they ought no longer to be treated as rational, nor receive any mental education. The consequence was that they were no longer taught to read, nor even to master Arithmetic enough to enable them to count the angles of their husband or children; and hence they sensibly declined during each generation in intellectual power. And this system of female non-education or quietism still prevails.</p></blockquote><p>And A-Square is concerned that this would lead to the overall decline of society. In comparison to 300 years ago, the intelligence of the contemporary residents in the two-dimensional world is gradually diminishing. A-Square firmly believes that it is imperative for the higher authorities to once again permit women to receive education.</p><blockquote><p>Already methinks I discern a weakness in the grasp of mathematical truth at the present time as compared with the more robust intellect of our ancestors three hundred years ago. I say nothing of the possible danger if a Woman should ever surreptitiously learn to read and convey to her Sex the result of her perusal of a single popular volume; nor of the possibility that the indiscretion or disobedience of some infant Male might reveal to a Mother the secrets of the logical dialect<strong>. On the simple ground of the enfeebling of the male intellect, I rest this humble appeal to the highest Authorities to reconsider the regulations of Female education.</strong></p></blockquote><p>A-Square's perspective is still constrained by the inertia of his deeply ingrained worldview.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0098b409-9fff-43ae-9409-3d707079d276.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Powerful Opponents of the Two-Dimensional Configuation Order</strong></h3><p>The order established by the Circle Priest class, with its emphasis on "Attend to your Configuration", has encountered formidable challengers in the history of the two-dimensional world.</p><p>In the past, people have discovered that the recognition of geometric shapes can be differentiated by coloring various edges.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f5b88d8d-ff61-46ec-9a7e-e05291e21274.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>(§ 9 Of the Universal Colour Bill)</p><blockquote><p><strong>Year by year the Soldiers and Artisans began more vehemently to assert—and with increasing truth—that there was no great difference between them and the very highest class of Polygons, now that they were raised to an equality with the latter, and enabled to grapple with all the difficulties and solve all the problems of life, whether Statical or Kinetical, by the simple process of Colour Recognition.</strong> Not content with the natural neglect into which Sight Recognition was falling, they began boldly to demand the legal prohibition of all 「monopolizing and aristocratic Arts」 and the consequent abolition of all endowments for the studies of Sight Recognition, Mathematics, and Feeling. Soon, they began to insist that inasmuch as Colour, which was a second Nature, had destroyed the need of aristocratic distinctions, the Law should follow in the same path, and that henceforth all individuals and all classes should be recognized as absolutely equal and entitled to equal rights.</p></blockquote><p>These revolutionaries are known as "<strong>Chromatistes</strong>."</p><p>The "<strong>Chromatistes</strong>" launched a formidable challenge against the "<strong>Formalist Order</strong>".</p><p>The "<strong>Chromatistes</strong>" put forth a new <strong>metaphysics </strong>and value system - "Color solves everything, and the spectrum signifies fulfillment."</p><p>However, the implementation of the "Chromatistes Values" (Colorist Values) resulted in unexpected side effects.</p><p>Science and Art were deemed redundant, leading to a decline in the overall intellect of society.</p><p>(§ 9 Of the Universal Colour Bill)</p><blockquote><p>The Art of Sight Recognition, being no longer needed, was no longer practised; and the studies of Geometry, Statics, Kinetics, and other kindred subjects, came soon to be considered superfluous, and fell into disrespect and neglect even at our University. The inferior Art of Feeling speedily experienced the same fate at our Elementary Schools. Then the Isosceles classes, asserting that the Specimens were no longer used nor needed, and refusing to pay the customary tribute from the Criminal classes to the service of Education, waxed daily more numerous and more insolent on the strength of their immunity from the old burden which had formerly exercised the twofold wholesome effect of at once taming their brutal nature and thinning their excessive numbers.</p><p></p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/edbbfddd-467f-4f0e-b515-85639277773c.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It has also caused unexpected confusion - confusion between circles and lines.</p><p>(§ 9 Of the Universal Colour Bill)</p><blockquote><p></p><p>Bear in mind the decay of Sight Recognition which threatened society at the time of the Colour revolt; add too the certainty that Woman would speedily learn to shade off their extremities so as to imitate the Circles; it must then be surely obvious to you, my dear Reader, that the Colour Bill placed us under a great danger of confounding a Priest with a young</p><p>Woman.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>The original intention of "<strong>Chromatism</strong>" was to weaken the aristocratic class, but inadvertently made the aristocratic class even stronger (due to the preservation of intellect).</p><blockquote><p></p><p>The second object aimed at by the Bill was the gradual demoralization of the Circles themselves. <strong>In the general intellectual decay they still preserved their pristine clearness and strength of understanding. From their earliest childhood, familiarized in their Circular households with the total absence of Colour, the Nobles alone preserved the Sacred Art of Sight Recognition, with all the advantages that result from that admirable training of the intellect.</strong> Hence, up to the date of the introduction of the Universal Colour Bill, the Circles had not only held their own, but even increased their lead of the other classes by abstinence from the popular fashion.</p><p></p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/3e886800-be79-486c-b2a5-36f8353daabd.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Under the belief that "color can solve everything," people also discovered the use of color for deception because, in the new system, people solely relied on color.</p><p>(§ 9 Of the Universal Colour Bill)</p><blockquote><p>It happened that an Isosceles of a low type, with a brain little if at all above four degrees—accidentally dabbling in the colours of some Tradesman whose shop he had plundered—painted himself, or caused himself to be painted (for the story varies) with the twelve colours of a Dodecagon. Going into the Market Place he accosted in a feigned voice a maiden, the orphan daughter of a noble Polygon, whose affection in former days he had sought in vain; and by a series of deceptions—aided, on the one side, by a string of lucky accidents too long to relate, and, on the other, by an almost inconceivable fatuity and neglect of ordinary precautions on the part of the relations of the bride—he succeeded in consummating the marriage. The unhappy girl committed suicide on discovering the fraud to which she had been subjected.</p></blockquote><p>The struggle between "chromatism (coluorism)" and "formalism" ended in a bloody coup and civil war, with the intellectually dominant old priesthood using means to eliminate the "Chromatistes."</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/821f5451-3a4f-4086-bcb9-aa96a439db3f.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>After that, colors were prohibited nationwide.</p><p>A-Square heard that colours would only appear in some of the most advanced and profound courses.</p><p>(§ 10 Of the Suppression of the Chromatic Sedition)</p><blockquote><p>Needless to say that henceforth the use of Colour was abolished, and its possession prohibited. Even the utterance of any word denoting Colour, except by the Circles or by qualified scientific teachers, was punished by a severe penalty. Only at our University in some of the very highest and most esoteric classes—which I myself have never been privileged to attend—it is understood that the sparing use of Colour is still sanctioned for the purpose of illustrating some of the deeper problems of mathematics.

                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>作者：房间里的人（社科研究者）</strong></p></blockquote><p>说起葡萄牙，你会想到什么？可能很多中国人首先想到是出身于马德拉岛的足球明星 C 朗拿度。但近年这个国家以另外一种方式被知晓─移民。</p><p>2008 年发生的金融危机令很多欧洲国家陷入经济困境，其中境况最差的葡萄牙、爱尔兰、希腊、西班牙、意大利被戏称为「欧猪五国」，政府缺钱自然需要想办法搞钱，黄金签证于是应运而生。它容许申请人通过投资等值 50 万欧元的不动产或基金的方式获得永久居留权，并在 5 年后容许申请入籍。</p><p>抛开婚姻形式不谈，移民基本上就是技术和投资两种形式。葡萄牙并没有太多技术性工作机会，而对于有投资能力的中国家庭，他们一般会更偏好经济更发达的英美或没有语言问题的新加坡。</p><p>然而随著中国和英美国际关系的变化和获得当地居留权变得越来越困难，投资成本较低同时条件宽松的黄金签证逐渐成为了移民市场上的宠儿。</p><p>事实上，中国的投资者是黄金签证最大的申请来源地，下面这张根据葡萄牙统计局制作的图片显示从 2012 年开始，截止 2023 年 9 月为止 12,178 通过投资获得黄金签证的申请者中有 5,407 位来自中国，占 44%。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ac0a63bc-d74c-4e26-a4e3-c33b5fbfb826.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>而以下的另一张图片提供的统计数据则显示自 2010 后，中国移民的数量开始快速增加。这个快速增加的移民群体也引起葡国牙学者的兴趣，希望搞明白这些移民是谁，又抱著怎样的心态来到葡萄牙。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/27ea9fa4-5b57-4479-ac34-757d40565c38.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>Source: Amante &amp; Rodrigues (2021).

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>本周我们搞搞新意思，来个粤语教室，聊聊谚语「葾猪头都有㒼鼻菩萨」。</p><p>「葾」，臭味，葾肨烂臭，传出难闻的异味，一般源于腐烂的食物。不同于普通话「我手写我口」，粤语有很多口语，多数人都不认识本字，真要写出来的话只能取同音但意思不相关的字，即所谓借字，「葾」是其一，通常会写成大家都认识的「冤」，也有人说正字应该是「蔫」，粤音「烟」。</p><p>「㒼」，通常会写成借字「萌」，也有人认为正字应为「盲」、「齆」，众说纷纭。「㒼」意思是闭塞不通，「㒼鼻」即呼吸不顺，我特别有资格谈论，因为一般人偶尔鼻塞，我却是偶尔呼吸畅顺，大部分时间都或多或少鼻塞。</p><p>广东人拜神喜欢用猪头，南方天气炎热，古时又没有冰箱，食物变坏发臭不足为奇，不过不打紧，菩萨是用木雕、石雕或泥塑的，总之都没有鼻孔，「葾猪头都有㒼鼻菩萨」，是指即使多数人厌恶的东西，总会找到欣赏的人，通常用于男女关系。</p><p>读到这里，相信你也能体会，粤语不但源远流长，更带丰富幽默感，很多谚语都十分「抵死啜核」，让人忍俊不禁。好了，今期我们就聊到这里… 开玩笑，以下开始正题。</p><h2>迎合大众口味还是寻找知音小众</h2><p>假如你是个认真的创作者，但作品没有人欣赏，你会：</p><ul><li><p>A：改变风格、路线或者创作媒介，以求迎合大众品味？</p></li><li><p>B：透过积累和整理作品、跟受众互动、推广、销售，更加努力地寻找知音？</p></li></ul><p>你作的曲不够琅琅上口，就写出更适合 K 歌的旋律；你拍的影片太过正经，就改成轻松搞笑的；你想用文字来表达但新一代把超过一百字的状态更新都标注 #长文慎入，就改用 TikTok 来制作内容吧。在商言商，怎么看 A 都像是正确答案。</p><p>我不会说 A 绝对错，只不过，如果所有作曲家都写 K 歌，所有 YouTuber 都走诙谐路线，所有人都用 TikTok 表达，那么非主流的人群谁来满足？既然说在商言商，我们且撇开理念，小众需求没人满足关我屁事。但是，小众需求没有人满足，在商言商，不正好是个商机么？反过来，所有人都跑去满足最大众化的需求，那岂不是很拥挤、竞争很激烈的市场？</p><p>你或许会说，我的作品太小众了，不走更大路的风格，会没有足够的人埋单。那当然有可能。不过，下这个结论之前，让我们先算算指头，看看曲有多高，和才会太寡。</p><p>假设你让粉丝以 50 港元或 200 台币月费订阅或支持你的作品，目标是 1000 位付费粉丝，即每月收入 5 万港元或 20 万台币，扣除假设占 20% 的信用卡、平台手续费、支援人员等成本，每月 4 万港元或 16 万台币，还是一份说得过去的收入，尤其是考虑到你做的是自己喜欢、相信的事。</p><p>那么，寻找 1000 位愿意付费支持你的粉丝是甚么概念？如果以香港人口为基数，就是每约 7000 人中找到一位知音人；以台湾人口为基数，则是每约 23,000 人中找到一位；以世界为基数，就是每 7,000,000 万人里面找到一位。</p><p>如果以上的算术没错，当你说自己的作品过于曲高和寡，没有足够的支持者，你基本上是说，在 7,000,000 人里头，即整整一个香港的人口，都没有一位愿意为你的作品埋单。真的是这样么？还是我们不够努力去找？</p><p>葾猪头尚且有㒼鼻菩萨，何况是用心的创作？除非你的风格、议题、创作媒介都只是试水，还没定型，随时可以改变，否则如果你认真创作，真心相信自己的作品，与其尝试随波逐流，还不如更努力在人海中找出知音人，一步一步向 1000 位粉丝迈进。</p><h2>1000 true fans</h2><p>为免盗取前辈的光环，我必须强调，这些洞见不是我原创的，而是来自人称 KK 的 Kevin Kelly。KK 早于 2008 年就写下短文 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1000 True Fans</a>，启发了千千万万的读者，当中不少后来成为非常成功的创作者或创业者。</p><p>1000 true fans 显然不是自古以来就适用的路径，毕竟在互联网诞生之前，要单人匹马把产品卖出方圆十公里外都很难，遑论在全球范围寻找知音人。1000 true fans 要成立，跟互联网的发展密不可分。</p><p>1993 年，WIRED 杂志创刊，定位「The Rolling Stone of Technology」，一直走在资讯科技与互联网文化的前沿。作为首任主编，也是 The Whole Earth Catalog 的编辑（对，就是封底印有「Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.」那份杂志），KK 对科技趋势，尤其是其对社会、经济的影响，有深刻的洞察力，出版了著名的三部曲<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.books.com.tw/products/E050031774">《失控》</a>、<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010874341">《科技想要甚么》</a>和<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010753764">《必然》</a>。</p><p>2008 年，互联网经历了十多年的发展，即使 iPhone 还没面世，KK 已经观察到一个新的典范，写下 1000 true fans，并由另一位著名作家与投资者 Tim Ferriss 到处推介，发扬光大。到了 2016 年，原文部份细节已经过时，随著 Tim Ferriss 收录 1000 true fans 一文的 <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788">Tools of Titan</a></strong> 出版，KK 重写了更简洁的新版本。</p><figure class="embed embed-video" data-provider="youtube"><div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/py43k-mSG7s?rel=0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>虽然两文相隔八年，而后者又距离当下接近八年，但 1000 true fans 的根本论述与倡议始终没变：作为创作者或创业者，如果目标不是发大财而是维持生计，你不需要目标百万、千万、上亿的客户，只需要寻找 1000 位忠实粉丝，持续做好自己，制作优秀的内容和产品；互联网不但让作者跟受众直接互动，又能轻松收费，是寻找并维系知音人的最佳媒介。</p><p>但我必须加上一个重要的注脚。即使目标不只是维生而是扬名立万，1000 true fans 亦是起步阶段的不二法门；成功找出并满足 1000 位忠粉，再来考虑横向或纵向发展，比起一开始就嫌市场太小不够做，靠谱得多。Y Combinator 的联合创办人 Paul Graham 提出过很多务实的创业建议，其中一个最重要的正是「<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/brian-chesky-ges-entrepreneurship.html">it’s better to have 100 people love you than a million people that sort of like you</a>」。</p><h2>我的 135 位㒼鼻菩萨</h2><p>我 kin ko 虽然也是 KK，但除了粤语恐怕没一样比得上 Kevin Kelly，唯有拾他牙慧，以「葾猪头都有㒼鼻菩萨」为 1000 true fans 补充这个时空的脉络，分享我实践过程中的体会。</p><p>有人觉得，我明知文字已经不流行还只写文章和出书，流连的社区与支持的产品都跟文字、文章、书本密不可分，不肯转型 YouTuber、Podcaster，或者做出更顺应时代的产品，说得好听是坚持 L，说得不好听只是个老顽固。</p><p>固执的确有一点，坚持或许也说得上，但那都不是重点。最核心的原因其实是，潮流总是在变化，即使学会迎合，也很易计划赶不及变化，与其刻舟求剑，不如保持一贯风格，择善固执，把迎合的心力都省下来持续创作、推广以及从各种角度重申观点，寻找懂得欣赏自己的 1000 true fans。</p><p>这跟不肯聆听意见的「死牛一面颈」，差之毫厘。聆听固然是好，但听谁的，甚么时候听，都是关键。如果我说你创作的古典音乐有点老土，你该做是无视我而专注寻找知音，就算莫札特再世，我都会觉得他的曲子老土，我根本不是你的受众。即使是潜在受众群中，Alice 跟你说太左，Bob 跟你说太右，Carol 跟你说太大，听从所有意见是逻辑上的不可能，死路一条；在锁定个人特色前就随别人意见改来改去不是聆听，而是还没找到自身特色。聆听是与粉丝互动的过程，跟《喜剧之王》提到「由外入内再到外」的方法演技差不多，首先要创作者向外展现个人特色，找到初步的知音后，所获的反馈才是最宝贵的意见，需要细心琢磨，考虑融入到个人风格，再一次对外呈现。</p><p>我可并不是说，锁定个人风格去寻找知音人会比走大众化路线来得简单，我体会到的刚好相反，要找到 1000 位愿意为自己作品埋单的人绝不轻松，需要顽强的意志，不挠的毅力和坚定的信念。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/bb0eaf49-a9ca-4009-9ec0-a8bce46102ac.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>liker.land/ckxpress</figcaption></figure><p>我从去年中起把每篇文章和相关旧文都出版成 Writing NFT 供读者收集，直到上周，NFT 持有人数量才刚刚到达 1000，执笔之际，共 1002 人。本来，去年出版的《所谓「我不投资」，就是 all in 在法定货币》就有 943 位读者购买，不过好些读者都太大方，拿到文本甚至单是支持就满足，总是不来领取应得的 NFT，我只好替这些读者暂时保管，搞不好要带著这份责任入土。</p><p>不过，NFT 持有人只是单次客户，去年卖出一千本书的确是足够我生活一个月，问题是我可不能每月出版一本书，一年能出版一本都很不错了。参考 KK 的说法，true fans 的定义是总会购买你新作的粉丝，铜臭却真实，因为那才称得上是固定收入，有了这个 fan base，创作者才能心无旁骛，维持品质，持续输出。</p><p>从这个角度，《区块链社会学》周报的付费订户才称得上忠粉，而我只有寥寥 135 位「true fans」（衷心多谢大家🙏🏼），达标进度仅 13.5%。122 期周报积累 135 位忠粉，平均每周每篇文章 1.1 位，如果维持这个节奏，即使所有人都不退订，我都还得再写 15 年多，才能积累到 1000 true fans。</p><hr><blockquote><p>我非常，非常需要大家支持。<br class="smart">如果我的文章给到你启发或乐趣，或者你认为我的文章有价值，请付费订阅。<br class="smart">请不要以为我有没有收入都一样，也不要误会我没所谓。我很需要靠写作带来收入，我超有所谓。<br class="smart">如果你能负担，请不要再犹豫，付费支持。</p><p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://weekly.dhk.org/subscribe?utm_source=ckxpress">👉 好，我考虑一下 👈</a></strong></p></blockquote><hr><p>进度不佳除了因为我坚持开放所有科普文章，较难说服读者付费，也因为几年前 LikeCoin 撤销香港注册，让我动态清零一次过失去百多位订户。不过，以上或多或少都只是借口，最重要的还是我不够努力推广，内向又社恐，写作虽然用力，但一到推广就放软手脚，佛系又随缘。</p><p>就算我克服个性，改善推广，寻找千位忠粉无论如何都是件苦差，更不要说，就算有天真的获得 1000 true fans，假如到时我的身心已经没法维持品质或产量，就算读者愿意单为老本付费，我也不好意思继续收费，宁愿停刊。说起这个，台港科技圈最受推崇的电子报，非已经停刊的《<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://daodu.tech/">科技岛读</a>》莫属，我也是《科》的忠粉，读过所有文章，听过所有 podcast，获益良多，但要说最最欣赏的一点，反而不是分析多有洞见，而是当周钦华先生感到没法一直维持高质输出，就毅然决定在高峰期停刊及按比例退款，毫不拖拉。</p><p>创作本来就是辛苦活，创作以外还要推广、营运、销售，更是百上加斤；1000 true fans 不是快速致富秘笈，丝毫没有提供让创作和推广变得轻松的秘技，再说，想要轻松的人生，根本不应以创作或创业维生。1000 true fans 理论纯粹告诉我们，如果你真正热爱创作并相信作品对世界的价值，就不必担心曲高和寡，只需要尽情创作，同时以最大努力寻找你的㒼鼻菩萨，不，1000 true fans。</p><hr><p>为了科普教育，我的文章全部开放阅读。即使未能付费订阅，也可以<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://liker.land/zh-Hant/nft/class/likenft1jdaenjrdyxhtwmcgpxj5kj3zvv2pww2slnz0n74yj657507j0ugqmvnh98?utm_source=widget">单次购入这篇文章</a>，作为纪念与支持。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b6d622a7-cf29-4586-b87a-4a146cb80187.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p>

                <![CDATA[<figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/55fff657-a79a-4791-9359-53201997e56b.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>《百年之孤寂第二年﹕往事与流言》(照片来源﹕https://shorturl.at/bnuU2)</figcaption></figure><p>文﹕小西</p><p>1982 年，成立不久的进念．二十面体接受台北新象艺术中心的邀请，随即把《龙舞》和《中国旅程之五﹕香港台北》等两个作品带到台湾，参与第一届亚洲戏剧节。1984 年，他们则带了《百年之孤寂第二年﹕往事与流言》以及《列女传 (国语版)﹕三个女人的一只神话》到台北国立艺术馆演出，主办单位是云门舞集。进念在 1980 年代初两次访台，无论从当时台湾媒体的广泛报导与评论，还是从台湾剧场中人的亲身见证，都在在为台湾剧场 (尤其是小剧场) 带来了一片冲击与影响。[1] 本文将尝试把大家带回上一个世纪八、九十年代的时空，看看到底是怎样的政治、经济、社会与文化条件，促成了进念对当时台湾小剧场的强烈冲击与深远的影响，以及在那个瞬息万变的年代，进念与台湾小剧场界之间频繁的文化交流情况。</p><p><strong>解严前的美学冲击</strong></p><p>根据进念．二十面体的艺术总监荣念曾的忆述，其实早在 1970 年代中期到末期，已在纽约跟「兰陵剧坊」的创办人吴静吉以及「云门舞集」的创办人林怀民认识。[2] 当时他们已经是台湾剧场界的重要人物，而「兰陵剧坊」更是台湾第一波小剧场运动的重要剧团之一。他认为当时内地与台湾都有着强烈的文以载道的传统，跟进念的风格相当不同。</p><p>荣念曾记得，1982 年，由于新象艺术中心要举办第一届亚洲戏剧节，想找香港的表演艺术团体，去了询问前香港艺穗会总监谢俊兴的意见。谢俊兴告诉他们，进念．二十面体刚刚成立，于是新象艺术中心便接受了他的意见，向进念发出了正式的邀请。不过，由于当时荣念曾正在协助王颖拍摄电影《点心》，相当忙碌，只交出了《中国旅程之五﹕香港台北》的剧本，并没有跟随林奕华、黄庆锵、欧雪儿等进念年轻成员赴台演出与交流。[3]</p><p>是次进念赴台参与第一届亚洲戏剧节的，包括《龙舞》与《中国旅程之五》。《龙舞》是一个儿童剧，由王守谦编写；《中国旅程之五》则以荣念曾之前创作的《中国旅程》二至四为基础编写而成。《中国旅程之五》基本上说的是劫机，讨论何谓安全，而其中一个重要议题是当时轰动台湾海内外的「陈文成事件」。1981 年 5 月 20 日，美国卡尼基美隆大学统计系助理教授陈文成全家自美返台探亲，7 月 2 日被三名警备总部人员带走约谈后，隔日清晨被人发现陈尸于台大研究生图书馆旁。当时国民党政府曾声称陈文成为畏罪自杀，但陈文成的家人与朋友则认为他遭政府谋杀。「陈文成事件」至今真相未明，却引起了台湾与国际社会的关注，曾经是台湾境内的高度敏感话题。可以想像，在前解严的国民党党国时代，要在作品中透过「陈文成事件」讨论何谓安全、安全与暴力之间的关系等敏感议题，当时大概只有像进念这样对政治高度敏感的外来前衞艺术团体才有胆量在舞台上直接提出，其可能产生的轰动性，也就可想而知。但荣念曾认为，对于台湾的观众来说，《中国旅程之五》所带来的，首先还是美学上的冲击﹕</p><blockquote><p>这是一个结构性很强的作品，因为我设定了一个 chart，里面的内容全都是大家可以自行填补的。他们做了这个作品，也是台湾第一次看见非敍事体的作品，对他们来说是有一定的冲击的。他们看到一些意象和片段是需要你自己拼凑变成你自己的故事。这是 1982 年，我认为对台湾戏剧界有一个比较重要的冲击。因为他们和香港是同文同种，大家都是讲中文的，对他们来说比较亲切，而不是他们去看韩国人讲述卡夫卡等等。</p><p>据我得到消息，他们所有表演的场次都是满座的，甚至最后面是站满了人的。其中一个就是陈国富，他现在是一个很重要的电影制作人，他也导演了好几套重要的电影。也包括你刚刚提到的鸿鸿。他们都很好奇，香港究竟会带来什么实验性的作品。以前他们习惯了看敍事体的作品，那是他们第一次看到一个作品，需要他们参与其中的、需要投放一个想法，对他们来说是很新鲜的。[4]</p></blockquote><figure

年代初对台湾的剧场界甚至文化界造成这样大的冲击? 按钟明德的分期，1980-1990 年代的台湾小剧场运动可分为两个阶段﹕(一) 「实验剧时期」﹕1978 年，心理学博士吴静吉在耕莘实验剧团 (后来兰陵剧坊的前身) 所主持的演员训练，将当时外外百老汇所风行的肢体、声音训练和集体即兴创作方法传授给金士杰、卓明、黄承晃、刘静敏等第一代台湾小剧场创作人，促使了兰陵剧坊于 1980 年的成立。之后，经过五届「实验剧展」的助长，到 1983 年赖声川回台，创立表演工作坊，在 1985 年以《那一夜，我们说相声》集其大成，实验剧由发芽到开花结果，可算是台湾小剧场运动的第一阶段。(二)「前衞剧时期」﹕第二代小剧场在 1986 年崭露头角，其中有些剧团 (例如屏风表演班、果陀剧场等) 继承了「实验剧」的演出方法与风格，有些则在「实验剧」的基础上再进一步发展，加上受当时美国、日本、香港前衞剧场的影响，拓展出跟第一代小剧场在政治与美学上廻异的「前衞剧」，例如环墟、河左岸、当代台北、零场、优剧场等等。<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

年代的台湾小剧场运动的内在发展逻辑，基本上是「戏剧地再现台湾此时此刻的欲望」。[6] 在台湾小剧场出现之前，台湾现代戏剧一直以「话剧」为主导，一种沿袭自从二十世纪一、二十年代发展出来的中国/台湾现代戏剧形式。但由于 1980 年代以前，台湾的「话剧」大多坚守当时国民党政府的反共抗俄意识形态、笃行「推广标准国语」，「话剧」一直难以在台湾本土生根发展。就此而论，「实验剧」的兴起，可算是在原有话剧机制外另起炉灶的企图。虽然「实验剧」基本上仍然说「国语」，也无力质疑国民党的党国意识形态，但在题材上已更贴合当代台北的生活与言行举止，在表演形式上则加入儿童剧场、传统戏曲等「新」的实验元素。<a target="_blank"

若果说「实验剧」跟「话剧」尚有一些折衷和合的地方，1986 年后崛起的「前衞剧」则在美学与政治上更彻底地反体制与颠覆，跟「话剧」划清界线，且更严肃地挖掘与看待台湾被压抑的语言和历史。[8]</p><p>换言之，进念两次访台 (1982 与 1984 年) 正好处于台湾小剧场运动的第一和第二阶段之间。这也解释了为甚么进念的非敍事剧场风格，会在 1980 年代初对台湾的剧场界甚至文化界造成这么大的冲击。虽然，早在 1965 年《剧场》杂志同人已在耕莘文教院的大礼堂翻译并上演贝克特的名剧《等待果陀》，<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://matters.news/@VXNlcjoxMTAx/%E5%BD%A2%E5%BC%8F%E7%9A%84%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB-%E9%80%B2%E5%BF%B5-%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E9%9D%A2%E9%AB%94%E8%88%87%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%B0%8F%E5%8A%87%E5%A0%B4%E6%97%A9%E6%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81%E5%8F%B2-bafybeihg5m7632b26tbw6vz3qyghwomqxnzqipmft4yoznsh5ipod3j4cm#_ftn9">[9]</a> 但始终 1960 与 1980 年代的政治、社会与文化时空廻异，像《等待果陀》那样的非敍事剧场作品 (虽然仍然有很重的语言成份)，并没有像 1980 年代初的进念那样在 1960 年代中激起同样的美学与政治上的冲击。1980 年代初与中期是当代台湾「旧的正在死去，新的还没有到来」的过渡时期，社会上充满了蠢蠢欲动、四处流窜的躁动能量，而进念的非敍事剧场风格正好为第二代台湾小剧场的年轻人打开了一个美学与政治上的缺口。</p><p><strong>国际社会上的亚细亚孤儿</strong></p><p>此外，进念 1980 年代初两次访台之所以会对台湾的剧场界造成这样大的冲击，也跟当时台湾在国际社会上的位置有关。虽然随着台湾六、七十年代的「经济奇迹」，台湾的整体国民经济与生活水平，都慢慢得到改善，但也随着七十年代「退出联合国」(1971 年)、「中日断交」(1972 年)、「中美断交」(1978 年)，无论在政治与文化上，台湾在国际社会上都日趋孤立。虽然，台湾剧场界与文化界一直都有透过翻译与报导接触欧美前沿文化，但却鲜有机会临场观赏。可以想像，当进念在 1980 年代初，把当时的台湾人年轻仅能透过书本或杂志认识的欧美前衞剧场摆在他们的眼前，会有多大的震撼。当时还很年轻的台湾著名剧场导演与剧评人鸿鸿，便这样描述那份震撼的经验﹕</p><blockquote><p>因为那个时候关于 Robert Wilson，我们只能看到一些文字资料跟剧照。没有人看过现场表演，甚至是录影，那时根本没有这些东西流动。我们看了进念·二十面体的《百年孤寂》，就好像看到 Robert Wilson 在我们面前演出一样。<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://matters.news/@VXNlcjoxMTAx/%E5%BD%A2%E5%BC%8F%E7%9A%84%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB-%E9%80%B2%E5%BF%B5-%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E9%9D%A2%E9%AB%94%E8%88%87%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%B0%8F%E5%8A%87%E5%A0%B4%E6%97%A9%E6%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81%E5%8F%B2-bafybeihg5m7632b26tbw6vz3qyghwomqxnzqipmft4yoznsh5ipod3j4cm#_ftn10">[10]</a></p></blockquote><p>况且，说起国际，当时台湾的连结大概跟欧陆的比较少，根据鸿鸿的观察，要做国际交流的话，可能一个路线是美国，另一个就是香港，「因为香港当时对于台湾人来说，是一个更国际化、更多关系网络的地方。所以感觉在美学、创作上都有一些比较新的探索是台湾没有的。」[11]</p><p>除了美学上，1980 年代初进念访台时也在政治上对台湾造成了不少的冲击。根据荣念曾的忆述，除了《百年孤寂》之外，进念第二次访台也带了《列女传》去演出与交流。《列女传》是有关性别议题与女性主义的﹕</p><blockquote><p>对台北的观众来说是很震撼的，我们可以这么直接地讨论这些主题。当然，我们也是用非敍事体在讲述，我们并不是真的在讲故事，但实际上又是在讲故事。我转变了性别和身份的议题，我们在讲耶稣其实是女人，有十二个女人在跟著她去搞革命。这是比较早期的社会主义。然后《金瓶梅》也是转换了性别，变成了一个女人养了六个男妾氏。这些于中国传统、宗教而言是一个实验。[12]</p></blockquote><p>我们知道，随着 1987 解严，台湾社会要待至 1980 年代末、1990 年代初才出现第一波波澜壮阔的女性主义运动，更莫说 1990 年代才崛起的酷儿运动。由此可见，基于历史的偶然，进念也在 1980 年代初，在误打误撞的情况下为台湾的公民社会送上第一轮的性别冲击波。</p><figure class="image"><img

与经验上都跟当时台湾小剧场的年轻一代有着一定距离。这或许也解释了为甚么跟九十年代的沙砖上不同，荣念曾在 1980 年代台湾的出现，更多被视为启蒙「剧场导师」甚至生命导师，而非同样青春叛逆的「同代人」。</p><p>根据荣念曾的忆述，他有随进念第二次访台演出。除了演出《百年孤寂》与《列女传》之外，他还主持了几个工作坊，开放给当时对表演艺术与实验艺术感兴趣的台北年轻人。无论在演出与工作坊之后，他都跟这一些台北年轻人有很多深入的讨论，「他们对我们写剧本的方法，以及所谓的剧本、文本的结构、处理方法都很有兴趣的」。<a

然后这些年轻人组成了几个团体，例如黄承晃的「笔记剧场」。[14] 这些台湾小剧场年轻团体一直有跟荣念曾联络，会来香港跟荣念曾持续讨论创作的问题，荣念曾也会在台湾看他们的演出，并跟他们深入讨论。例如当时临界点剧象录的艺术总监田启元，他得了爱滋病后临终前还到香港探访荣念曾，「他很绝望，我们有很多讨论，关于身体和剧场的关系。他们来了香港，跟我聊了很久。」。<a target="_blank"

由此可见，荣念曾在台湾第二代小剧场的某些年轻人的心目中，的确有点「剧场导师」甚至生命导师的况味，这在台湾当时一片反权威与反父权的时代氛围下，的确别具意味。</p><p>若论进念/荣念曾对台湾小剧场发展的影响之深，大概要数黄承晃的「笔记剧场」，尤其是黄承晃本人。「笔记剧场」正式成立于 1985 年 5 月，随即在新象小剧场演出《流言》与《旧约》等两个作品。《流言》是根据荣念曾的剧本《旧约》所做的演出，而《旧约》则是由笔记自己团员集体创作而成的七个女孩子的恋爱故事。根据黄承晃自己的解释，这种剧本名称上的混淆，「有想像不到的新鲜感，我们就这样做了。」[16] 这种看似无所谓的态度，若果被理解为黄承晃对他的「剧场导师」甚至生命导师荣念曾的戏谑式的致敬，大概也不为过 (注留﹕1984 年访台的演出《百年之孤寂第二年》，副题为﹕「往事与流言」)。</p><p>事实上，进念在 1980 年代两次访台时，黄承晃看了他们的演出便甚为喜欢，事后也跟荣念曾经常交换意见。而且早在 1985 年成立「笔记剧场」以前，他已向荣念曾拿过剧本，在 1984 年 11 月推出演出《情蚀》。可见进念/荣念曾对黄承晃/笔记剧场的影响之深。根据钟明德的分析，虽然《情蚀》、《流言》与《旧约》等演出内容上都不脱男欢女爱的快感与疼痛，但在美学形式上已跟兰陵剧坊或表演工作坊等「实验剧」不同，演出中演员已经不再扮演角色，对白常常呈现为机械性的独白或反复，整体风格往「非个人性、非剧情性、非再现性演出方式」的后现代剧场方向走，<a target="_blank"

而这明显受到进念/荣念曾作品中的非敍事剧场风格的直接影响。</p><p>当然，1980 年代初进念与台湾小剧场的交流也不是单向的。记得笔者 1980 年代中开始先后在进念的礼顿道与湾仔会所留连的日子，便有机会透过录像带观赏云门舞集、表演工作坊等台湾现代舞与第一代小剧场的作品。而这种港台之间颇原始的作品交流方式，往后却造就了更多意想不到的「文化交流」﹕</p><blockquote><p>我清楚记得，赖声川把他所有作品的 Copy 都给了我们。然后有一次赖声川台北办公室淹水，他们所有的材料都丢失了。他们问我，当时给你的材料能不能复制一份给我们。这是我印象很深的，这是关于交流。原来也有这样的作用，当我要重建历史时，我们的纪录丢失了，可以问对方拿回来。</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img

年代，进念对外交流的活动更频繁，规模也更大，在《中国旅程 1997》、《中国旅程 1998》和《中国旅程 1999》等演出交流系列中，香港与台湾更被置放在一个更大跨城市、跨地域的网络中进行深度文化交流。</p><p>其实早在 1980 年代，透过跟中国内地与台湾的交流，荣念曾已察觉到香港「可以是中国和台湾中间的重要平台，让大家可以心平气和地去讨论。我看见中国的很多习性是比较自我中心的。我觉得台湾也是。这很多时候都启发我们思考香港的重要性。因为我们都没什么自我中心，大家都在很放松的状态。」<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

创造出一个交流的平台，看看「不同的文化背景怎么处理时间、空间、演员、资源的局限」。<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

换言之，透过这种形式主义的文化交流模式设定，更能比对出不同地方在创意、文化甚至政治上的同和异。</p><p>这样说来，《中国旅程》系列的形式主义文化交流模式，其实一早已蕴含在进念那种结构性很强的剧场美学风格之内。在《龙舞》、《中国旅程之五》、《百年之孤寂》、《列女传》等作品中，进念都是由一些文化符号出发，建构一个有足够开放度的框架，让观众可以在内容上自行填补，它们需要观众「参与其中的、需要投放一个想法」。说到底，「文化交流一般都是借别人来讲自己的东西的」，<a

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>一个世纪以前，爱因斯坦的相对论将我们的理解推向了一个全新的高度。他的理论不仅揭示了时间和空间的深层关系，而且提醒我们每一刻的价值。然而，我们是否真的理解了这样的信息，并且在我们短暂且宝贵的生命中体现出来呢？</p><p>相对论认为时间是相对的，不同的观察者将会有不同的时间感知。这一点在我们繁忙的日常生活中有时会体现得淋漓尽致。当我们忙碌于工作，疲于奔波时，时间似乎在无声无息中飞逝。然而，当我们在休闲时刻，或者在等待某件重要事情的来临时，时间又仿佛迟缓地流动。我们每天都在时间的摆荡中，奔波劳碌，而生命的沙漏却在不停地流逝。</p><p>我们是不是因为生活中的种种繁杂，而忽视了生命中的美好与独特呢？我们是否过于专注于追求物质的富足，而忽视了心灵的富足呢？爱因斯坦的相对论提醒我们，时间是个相对的概念，每一刻都拥有其独特的价值。我们是否能够深刻理解这个道理，并且在生活中实践呢？</p><p>我们的生命就像是一艘在时间海洋中的船，每一刻都在向前进。我们不能停止时间的流逝，也不能回到过去。我们所能做的，只是掌握好舵，确保我们的航向。我们需要学习欣赏每一刻，珍惜每一刻，因为这些都是我们生命中的独特瞬间。</p><p>生活中有许多美好的事物值得我们去欣赏和珍惜，如家人的笑声、朋友的陪伴、自然的美景、书籍的智慧、美食的滋味、音乐的旋律...这些都是我们在时间的海洋中的小岛，是我们在奔波劳碌的生活中的驿站。我们需要学会停下脚步，去欣赏这些生活中的美好，去体验这些独特的瞬间。</p><p>在繁忙的生活中，我们有时会感到迷茫和困惑，但我们需要记住，只有珍惜每一刻，我们才能真正体验生活的价值。就像爱因斯坦的相对论一样，我们的生活也是相对的，每一刻都有其独特的价值和美。</p><p>所以，让我们慢下脚步，去欣赏生活中的每一刻。</p>

                <![CDATA[<p><br class="smart">中国数字时代：新一轮巴以冲突产生以来，国内舆论场上对哈马斯的恐怖主义，及其虚伪「正义性」做了很深入地分析、揭露，这是很有价值的。但是国内的知识阶层出现了一种矫枉过正的倾向，他们选择性忽略巴以冲突的复杂现实，以及形成中的是非曲直，对以色列无尽的道德美化、合法化辩护......（文章链接：阜成门六号院｜我毫不同情哈马斯，但也不接受无底线美化以色列）</p><p></p><p>我：这篇文章非常好</p><p></p><p>「以色列的确充满先进文明的国家，它是中东第一个民主国家，科技、教育上都创造了伟大成就，但是这种文明只是在本国国界内、对自己人的文明」</p><p>我们不要忽视了很多「文明」是有严格物理和人群界限的，如果故意忽略它对别人不文明一面，一味地喊「站在文明一边」就成了助纣为虐，就成了愚蠢。」</p><p>这段说的非常好</p><p></p><p>Mario Nawfal：（翻译）埃胡德-巴拉克关于加沙的建议</p><p>以色列前总理埃胡德-巴拉克建议埃及、阿联酋和摩洛哥共同组建一支阿拉伯维和部队：</p><p>"以色列将屈服于国际压力，将加沙交给一支阿拉伯维和部队，其中可能包括埃及、摩洛哥和阿拉伯联合酋长国。他们将确保该地区的安全，直到巴勒斯坦权力机构能够控制该地区"。</p><p>资料来源：《经济学人》</p><p></p><p>朱韵和：（转发并翻译了这篇推文）</p><p></p><p>我：这个建议其实很不错</p><p></p><p>Aric Toler：以色列和美国情报官员认为，在阿赫利阿拉伯医院爆炸前不久，视频中捕捉到的一枚射弹是巴勒斯坦火箭弹。</p><p>@nytimes 目视调查发现该物体是从以色列发射的，可能与致命爆炸无关</p><p></p><p>Michael Anti：纽约时报的视觉调查记者仔细合并了 5 个当场的直播视频，并且全部在地图上做了回溯，认为当时的确有以色列的某种炮弹（比如铁穹）参与，但到底加沙医院谁炸的，他们也无法分析出，仅证明以方证据不够。【这个调查做了个寂寞啊，我要是值班主编，肯定让他们调查清楚了再发布】</p><p></p><p>我：就是铁穹拦了哈马斯火箭弹，然后在医院上空或者临地爆炸。现在发布是要赶上时效。等完全搞清楚，这场战争可能都结束了</p><p></p><p>以色列在中国：从今晚起，这里就在我们的大使馆

日的大屠杀中被哈马斯恐怖分子杀害的无辜以色列平民。</p><p></p><p>分享并帮助我们传播关于被绑架的无辜者的消息，并把他们带回家。（视频）</p><p></p><p>我：希望她/他们重获自由。也希望加沙人民都得到自由</p><p></p><p>visegrad 24 ：（翻译）Fahima Karim，@UAInst 的学生和 Marie Andersen，WUM 的学生。（两张图片，这两个学生分别在不同场合，举着「让世界干净」并把以色列（国旗）丢进垃圾桶的海报。）</p><p></p><p>我：这当然也是恶的。虽然以色列欺凌巴勒斯坦，但全世界穆斯林围攻以色列，也是以大欺小、以多欺少。暗示种族清洗更是可耻</p><p></p><p>Piers Morgan Uncensored：（翻译）以色列前总理纳夫塔利·贝内特表示，约旦女王拉尼娅指责以色列是种族隔离国家时「完全撒谎」。</p><p></p><p>「拉尼娅女王感到羞耻，她感到羞耻。她能说出这些公然的谎言，这真是令人遗憾。」</p><p></p><p>陈军：公平起见，我昨天转发了约旦皇后有关的视频，今天转发以色列前总理（2021-2022）在电视上对其的反驳。</p><p></p><p>他举了例子证明在以色列有巴勒斯坦人担任最高法官等，所以以色列治下不存在种族隔离。</p><p></p><p>我：曾国藩担任两江总督，就没有满汉区隔了？美国南北战争时南方也有黑人军人，所以没有种族隔离了吗？对了抗战期间，汪精衞、溥仪名义上还比驻中国日军司令地位高呢。实际上呢？</p><p>另外，以色列有两成巴裔公民，但还有更多巴裔没有公民权，只能打工。当然这也是以色列怕巴裔太多鸠占鹊巢。但的确是种族隔离</p><p></p><p>Safarier03 Liam：又一个虚假信息：在巴勒斯坦社交媒体上广泛传播的「在加沙去世的儿童」照片集中，至少有一名儿童被证明是在 2021 年 5 月哈马斯的火箭袭击中丧生的以色列儿童，其他儿童照片的来源尚不清楚。</p><p></p><p>(哪怕只有一个，就足以证明他们在说谎欺骗世界)（图片）</p><p></p><p></p><p>瑞典茉莉：拜登说过，他对巴勒斯坦方面公布的数据持怀疑态度。</p><p></p><p>哈马斯的每一句话都不能信。他们是一群凶残狡诈无耻的人。</p><p></p><p>我：六四时候还有人谣传王丹被杀，后来显然没死。难道可以否认六四时候中共杀了一些学生吗？</p><p></p><p>大声：《外交事务》这篇文章，分析了对巴勒斯坦人过去几年的多次民调，有助了解那里的人们究竟在想什么，他们最真切的希望和失望。比如，在这次冲突发生之前，相比以色列的长期封锁，加沙地带人民更加反对的是哈马斯的统治。（链接）</p><p></p><p>我：孤证不立，除非更多媒体、学术和民调机构，有起码 50% 佐证巴勒斯坦人讨厌哈马斯胜过以色列。单独一篇文章，选择性找几个民调，不能说明问题。</p><p>看看台湾民调，不同媒体结果差别太大了，选择的样本不同，提问诱导性差异、统计方式不同，结果大相径庭。</p><p>哈马斯的确不是善类，但在巴人那里，比以色列口碑好</p><p></p><p>Quds News Network：（翻译）以色列记者吉迪恩·利维（Gideon Levy）：「我不记得在哪一次占领中，占领者将自己表现为受害者。」（视频）</p><p></p><p>我：以色列国内、各国犹太人，都很多有良心的，倒是中国一帮人替以色列侵略者摇旗呐喊、各种粉饰甚至称颂</p><p></p><p>无论个人之间还是族群之间，各种恶性竞争、利益冲突，以及形成的恶劣社会环境，不可能只靠单方妥协来和解与改变。那样只有善良守序者吃亏、损人利己者得利。</p><p>比如插队，坏人插队好人排队，那好人就一直排不上；比如酒店大厅打电话，大家都大喊大叫、你小声不打扰别人，那你反而不能正常通话</p><p></p><p>中国自由派支持以色列，其实本质都是社达心理和「敌反对就支持」的扭曲心态作祟。其实他们还不如明确说「反正我就支持强者、支持以色列、支持中共反对的/反对中共支持的」，而不要再找各种具体借口，例如同情以色列妇女儿童。这更加虚伪和狡辩。因为按社达理论，妇女儿童不应该得到比成年男性更多的同情</p><p></p><p>我同情加沙人民，但也认为应警惕伊斯兰极端主义和保守主义，以及它对世界的影响。</p><p>最近在世界各地爆发的穆斯林反以色列示威，名义上是同情弱者、民族解放，但也有强烈的宗教色彩、排他性、极端性。如果他们成为世界主导力量，绝不会比现在西方主导更讲人权和包容。</p><p>这一点上我是同意秦晖部分观察观点的</p><p></p><p>不仅 Metoo，国际关系方面，涉及到各种冲突纠纷，在是非不完全清楚或者双方对错参半情况下，人们（尤其有影响力的知识分子）应该更多同情弱势方、受害方，而把指责和压力更多给强势方、加害方，这样才能形成某种衡平。</p><p>另外，侵害和受害不能只看某个点上具体事、断代为史，还要看前因和全局、整体性评判</p><p></p><p>我：关于最近的巴以冲突、中东博弈、国际关系，可以回看一下刘慈欣的《三体》，里边有不少情节结合当今现实，颇是有价值和耐人寻味。</p><p>里边价值观是偏社达的，但讲的一些事实、道理、喻示，是很震撼和深刻的。奥巴马就高度评价了《三体》，同样是看到了其中的深刻之处。</p><p>大家可以回想回看一下</p><p></p><p>《三体》中不仅有直接提及巴以冲突、反映人类冤冤相报的内容，还有一些情节，或者说整个三体，都在反映族群冲突、尔虞我诈、生存竞争。</p><p>其中一部分，讲人类在自认为取得军事优势后，对三体同情和尊敬，希望和平共处。而三体人则利用了人类同情和放松警惕，派遣水滴袭击了人类舰队，将人类逼向灭亡</p><p></p><p>我写的《三体》书评，专门评论过这部分内容。</p><p>刘慈欣所写的，其实是人类各族群之间的真事。生存竞争是残酷的，人们之间是难以信任乃至相互欺骗的。善良、同情、信任，反在这种丛林社会下被坑死。从司马懿赚杀曹爽，到毛泽东镇反杀死百万起义国军，还有纳粹屠杀犹太人和南京大屠杀，残暴都以欺骗为手段</p><p></p><p>悉尼维尼 Sydney Winnie：国内的民族主义已经到了这个程度了吗？</p><p>看到以色列的东西就直接骂？（图片，国内互联网平台网友使用各种恶毒言辞辱骂以色列）</p><p></p><p>我：这些人是被恶意引导，将本来是中共政权压迫造成的痛苦，转移到仇恨美国、辱骂以色列。而且他们也并不真心同情加沙人民，无非是借机发泄而已</p><p></p><p>硅谷码农：一道选择题让我想起一个传说：在内战中曾有共军压着百姓向国军阵地进攻。我怀疑其真实性。但假定为真，那么国军应不应该开枪？开枪就会杀死平民百姓。不开枪就只有认输（投降或撤退）。这与加沙的情形或有不同，因为现在以军是攻方而非守方。但相同点在于另一方都使用人盾。我认为罪责在人盾使用者。</p><p></p><p>我：那如果国军不得已带着大批百姓逃难，中共追击并以剿匪为名射杀国军和百姓，应不应该呢？</p><p></p><p>小径残雪：巴勒斯坦现状。西岸，伯利恒，一座露天监狱。/1（许多图片，巴勒斯坦人生活在像监狱的环境中（或者说就是监狱），许多儿童没有童年，或者说童年都在战争中度过）</p><p></p><p>我：所以我早说了，从这里杀出去的人，做什么也不奇怪。让生活在痛苦绝望中的人们，还遵守道德，纯属慷他人之慨。再说杀以色列妇女儿童的，都已经被以军消灭了啊</p><p></p><p>唐丹鸿：世界上和历史上，通常战争结束的方式有如下几种：</p><p>占领</p><p>投降</p><p>耗散（少数情况）</p><p>单方面撤军</p><p>停火</p><p>外部强制中断</p><p>停火前后的妥协和协议。</p><p></p><p>联合国应该知道，达成停火的最快路线是：哈马斯在屠杀 1,400 多名以色列人后，现在立刻释放全部人质并投降。</p><p></p><p>我：那谁来保障此后加沙人民的安全呢？以后加沙能否被解除封锁隔离？或者压迫还会加剧？</p><p>另外，我看很多自由派和东突人士，在新疆问题上可不是这么想的。没觉得要维族放弃抵抗中共，屈服于陈全国，换取新疆和平，反而一致指责中共镇压是包括发生暴恐袭击的新疆冲突根源</p><p></p><p>我一直以为反对新疆再教育营的，肯定都是反对以色列侵占巴勒斯坦、压迫加沙人民的。尤其是自由派学者肯定如此。</p><p>现在看显然不是这样，非常双重标准。哪怕以色列压迫加沙的力度、造成人员死亡，其实是超过新疆集中营的。</p><p>选择性的关心，呵呵</p><p></p><p>另外，作为旅居以色列的学者，应该尽可能保持客观中立，而不是因为在那里享受到以政府和公民的各种服务、帮助、友爱，就不分青红皂白的站在以色列一边。</p><p>同样，像旅居日本的一大票中国人，因为在日本得到一些好于中国国内的生活，就卖身投靠，各种跪舔日本，也是非常恶心的。在美欧的也应该尽可能中立</p><p></p><p>我：不仅 Metoo，国际关系方面，涉及到各种冲突纠纷，在是非不完全清楚或者双方对错参半情况下，人们（尤其有影响力的知识分子）应该更多同情弱势方、受害方，而把指责和压力更多给强势方、加害方，这样才能形成某种衡平。</p><p>另外，侵害和受害不能只看某个点上具体事、断代为史，还要看前因和全局、整体性评判</p><p></p><p>我：以色列这些天杀害的巴勒斯坦人包括妇女儿童，是前些天哈马斯突击造成死亡的起码十几倍，而且数字仍然在迅速增长。</p><p>不仅这本身就是不人道的残暴行径，即便从「以牙还牙」角度，也足够报复了。现在停止，也就算了。巴勒斯坦人也不可能被消灭。以色列应该撤军了</p><p></p><p></p><p>联合早报

Nguyen：（翻译）有趣的是，新加坡投票支持约旦关于加沙人道主义休战的决议，而印度却投了弃权票。新加坡与以色列的关系有着悠久的历史，并且有传闻称以色列帮助建立了新加坡军队。</p><p></p><p>我：新加坡的立场是兼顾现实与人道，非常好</p><p></p><p>BBC News 中文：【一周热点回顾】被哈马斯掳走的超过 200 名以色列人质都是谁？BBC

News：一场严峻的信息战与以色列和加沙的人身暴力并行，虽然这种形式的战争与战争本身一样古老，但在社交媒体的帮助下，它现在正在大规模实时发生。（链接）</p><p></p><p>我：没错，信息战就是战争一部分，在看似文明的现代社会更是重要</p><p></p><p>Snow FlakeZero：如果以色列能在中东地区推进土改，惩戒绿蝻，解放妇女，批斗阿訇，强推世俗化，帮助中东工业化，派扫盲队下乡，推广义务教育和医疗，那我愿称以色列为「正义之师」，我绝对支持以色列解放整个中东</p><p></p><p>可惜以色列不是，以色列只想抢点地盘，把阿拉伯人赶进缺水缺电的大监狱里，拿导弹无差别对妇女儿童开</p><p></p><p>我：没错</p><p></p><p>MASK

2018 年一份地缘政治刊物上的专论，题目是：犹太复国主义的本质。</p><p></p><p>我不了解他对犹太复国主义的解读多大程度上代表了普京或某些俄罗斯精英的看法，但他文章所暗示的结论和目前一些流行的看法有呼应的部分：巴以冲突是千年宗教冲突的延续····（下面内容太长省略）</p><p></p><p>我：杜金对于犹太复国主义及巴以冲突、阿拉伯世界与西方的冲突的观点，其实就是发动俄乌战争理论的延续。杜金和许多俄罗斯保守派认为，西方已在同性恋、多元化、女权、世俗主义之类东西下「堕落」了，并且被包括犹太人在内「深层政府」控制。发动俄乌战争，就是为了击败西方「深层政府」。</p><p>这套东西蛊惑了很多人</p><p></p><p>陈军：问题是，内塔尼亚胡也用这样《旧约》的部分敍事逻辑，我们就自然会看到土耳其总统的反应····。以巴冲突无论短期如何解决，它所留下的隐患，可能在未来以更惨烈的方式爆发。</p><p></p><p>许多历史上大事件的结局，往往和「自我实现的预言」有关，和各民族的自我认同有关，而和其内容否对错无关。</p><p></p><p>我：这的确是自我实现和恶性循环。但如果直接没有民族和教派意识，只会被其他势力吞噬，而不会真的和平或者独善其身。从古至今，人们都以族群形式存在，当今人类社会也不例外。只能通过某种平衡，而不是放弃民族认同。或者说有办法让所有民族宗教都放下狭隘的身份成为世界公民，而不能只要求一部分人这么做</p><p></p><p>这就像裁军、废除核武器，不能要求单方面放弃，而是要双方一起裁减。我裁了你不裁，那以后你打过来怎么办？</p><p>民族主义和教派主义也是这样。它的确是一种狭隘的意识形态，只顾自己族群。但物以类聚人以群分，就像家庭一样，也是狭隘但却根深蒂固。而且存在价值观、习俗、语言等差异，也难真的大同</p><p></p><p>老鱼吹牛皮

Anti：拜登政府对以色列友善这点就不说了，问题是这个政府同时也对杀戮记者、支持各地极端主义的沙特政府也友善。以色列游说有钱，但海湾国家也有钱。所以这事在美国内部不会很快结束，双方定会继续撒钱影响美国外交政策。</p><p></p><p>我：沙特其实和以色列是友好关系，不是敌对的</p><p></p><p>Michael Anti：支持巴勒斯坦的美国人发誓不投拜登也没意义，因为难道你想让川普上台？拜登政府吃定你们最后含泪投票。</p><p></p><p>我：希拉里也是这么想的，然后就悲剧了</p><p></p><p>Dr. Eli David：（翻译）意大利：LGBTQ+ 🏳️‍🌈示威支持巴勒斯坦🇵🇸</p><p></p><p>我想知道他们会在巴勒斯坦对他们做什么🤔（视频）</p><p></p><p>我：LGBTQ 支持巴勒斯坦，同情弱势，这个没错。不过大多数伊斯兰国家都是禁止 LGBTQ 的。现在哈马斯法塔赫支持 LGBTQ，究竟是真心还是权宜，不太好说。我觉得权宜和统战成分大一些。和中共当年争取进步学生差不多。不当权就要把朋友搞得多多的、敌人少少的，但当权就翻脸了</p><p></p><p>Michael Anti：「从河到海」是巴勒斯坦人对 1948 年前巴勒斯坦全部地区的代称。具体可以看哈马斯 2017 年新纲领《一般原则和政策文件》：「巴勒斯坦东起约旦河，西至地中海，北起纳古拉角，南至乌姆拉什拉什，是一个完整的领土单元。」 但在同一个文件中，哈马斯不反对 1967 年边界作为全民谈判起步。（链接）</p><p></p><p>我：其实出于安全舒适考虑，以色列应该建国在欧洲，或者南美，而不是中东。即便考虑到耶路撒冷是圣城，也不应该在那。现在这样阿以双方都痛苦。而西方支持以色列在中东建国，也是楔钉子，居心不良</p><p></p><p>巴勒斯坦人受难，以色列也要天天防着周边阿拉伯各国还有伊朗，近的火箭弹覆盖以色列全境，远的中程导弹也完全覆盖以国。这情况下以色列才拼命发展包括核武在内各种武器、动不动跨境定点清除先发制人。然后仇怨越来越大，没办法和解。这比《三体》里地球和三体的互相威慑还要紧张可怕，而这本来可以避免</p><p></p><p>Michael Anti：当时二战更结束，犹太人被屠杀几百万，西方社会一面倒愧疚。</p><p></p><p>我：那不更应该在欧洲建国吗？慷阿拉伯人之慨算什么</p><p></p><p>Michael Anti：那毕竟复国主义者已经移民过去不少人了。</p><p></p><p>Y 先生_：在非洲找块地方多好……</p><p></p><p>我：其实在非洲也比中东好。例如在马达加斯加，以色列建国，然后每年给马达加斯加支付 100 亿美元，加上其他经济科技军事扶助，双赢</p><p></p><p>我：这位女士对我同情巴勒斯坦人、谴责以色列侵占、批判美国保守派，非常赞同支持。但是到了我批判中共、对伊斯兰极端主义表达反感和担忧，以及支持美国维护人权的政治军事活动时，又激烈反对。自己说话不文明，还指责我不文明。</p><p>这种人就不是真正的人权人士，仅仅是讲一面理、为反美而反美罢了（图片）</p><p></p><p>当然也有许多人是反过来的。我批判中共政权、讲中国人权问题，他们就点赞支持。但是讲同情巴勒斯坦、反对以色列侵略、批判美国保守派对内压迫弱势群体对外搞霸权主义，他们就不高兴了，就拉黑了，就骂人了</p><p></p><p>我并不反对批判美国帝国主义对外霸权、对内迫害弱势族群的恶行。相反，我是很支持相关批判的。</p><p>但在批判时，不应该忽略这世界上其他国家尤其欠发达国家和族群，其比美国更加蔑视人权、更残害本国及他国民众的暴行。而更不应该借助批判美国丑恶一面，去掩盖或淡化亚非拉各国独裁者戕害国内外人民的暴行</p><p></p><p>Matthew Miller：（翻译）以色列必须采取措施保护巴勒斯坦人免受以色列极端主义定居者的暴力侵害，追究袭击者和待命或未能干预的以色列国防军的责任。我们已经向以色列政府明确表示，这些袭击需要停止，责任人需要被追究责任。</p><p></p><p>陈军：（转发了这条推文）</p><p></p><p>我：民族或者阶级冲突中，一方对对立方的暴力行为，哪怕超过必要限度乃至杀害无辜，己方往往也是不会惩罚的。因为己方是一个整体，处罚会影响士气，影响团结。</p><p>这方面其实以色列还真是做了一些，例如会强拆一些犹太人定居点、把射杀巴勒斯坦人的以国人判刑。但大多数时候仍然是不处罚的，或者处罚力度很轻</p><p></p><p>我：这个谣传被哈马斯处决的欧洲和平人士，其实是被哈马斯敌对派别、和基地组织有关系的机构绑架杀害的。而且他本人也并不支持哈马斯一些行为。很多谣传完全将事实变了样（链接：在加沙被极端组织杀害的和平人士维多利奥·艾里格尼的维基百科）</p><p></p><p>美国之音中文网：新加坡国防部长黄永宏

是一名公交车司机，运载人们参加和平音乐节。他被哈马斯抓住，问清了他是东耶路撒冷的巴勒斯坦人，同样杀了他。尸体十天后被确认。电台有人分享了他的善，他让一个刚下飞机身无分文的人免费乘车从机场到北方（视频）</p><p></p><p>我：这当然是悲剧和罪行。不过，对于加沙的巴勒斯坦人，巴裔以色列公民的幸福，跟他们没关系，或者还有负关系。看见同胞被敌人扶植幸福生活，能不气吗？</p><p>话说南疆农村维族在乌市和全疆连维人也打也杀，不也这样原因吗？</p><p>以色列让这一百多万巴裔公民享有以色列的公共福利，而对加沙各种制裁，也是分而治之的伎俩</p><p></p><p>要是某个加沙人，投胎到巴勒斯坦裔以色列人家庭，那他也可能成为以国中产阶级，在耶路撒冷或特拉维夫有美满的生活，做慈善、助人为乐什么的，也是举手之劳；</p><p>反过来，要是巴裔以色列人投胎到加沙，那就很可能成为哈马斯成员。可能父母被炸死，女儿上不了学，自己一贫如洗，既没物质更没心情助人机票钱</p><p></p><p>我所说的这些，只是讲清楚现实情况和哈马斯成员的部分动机，并不是说这是对的。暴恐当然是错的。但如果不探寻暴力的来龙去脉，不去从根源改变不公不义，就无法阻止暴力发生。</p><p>即便在局部阻止，那也往往是以更大的暴力、不讲道理威压实现的。新疆集中营和加沙集中营，本质是类似的，且后者被杀戮更多</p><p></p><p>中国国内发生「献忠」事件后，自由派公知往往希望探寻原因，而五毛粉红社达，则喜欢说「我不想知道他经历过什么，我就想让他被判死刑/当场击毙」。</p><p>到加沙问题上，反过来了。自由派公知说「我不想知道哈马斯成员经历过什么，只想以色列消灭恐怖分子」。</p><p>这也说明了，许多公知只是立场站队，而非真有人道关怀</p><p></p><p>还有在国内的户籍制度、收容劳教制度、各种不平等政策上，自由派公知也是骂的很厉害。而且公知全都很反感「感恩共产党」的说法。</p><p>但到了巴以问题上，就成了以色列恩赐给巴勒斯坦人打工挣钱的机会、提供水电服务，好像以色列是加沙人的上帝。</p><p>这又反映了公知们普遍双重标准、逻辑不恰、立场决定是非的特征</p><p></p><p>陈军：如果把慕容的看法纯粹当作道德表态的自我满足实在是对人类复杂的事务缺乏基本的认知。</p><p></p><p>我们先看美国 911 之后打的两场正义之师的战争，不仅劳民伤财，结果还适得其反。</p><p></p><p>拜登总统自己承认，当时美国没有听其它同盟国的意见，为了复仇入侵了阿富汗和伊拉克。不仅这两场战争在过程中失去清晰战略目标，还把自己拖入一场长达 20 年之久的泥沼。</p><p></p><p>以色列这次反击哈马斯我看结果也会一样，所谓消灭哈马斯这一说，除了轰炸加沙以报复巴勒斯坦以外，没有可证明他们正在消灭哈马斯。同时，他们不在乎已经接近要谈成的亚伯拉罕协议和前面和阿联酋，巴林的合作协议，也不在乎他们的做法将留下多少后患，包括伊朗，土耳其，中国和俄国的卷入，这样不明智之举，只有背后有不可告人的目的才可以解释。</p><p></p><p>在我看来，内塔尼亚胡目前的做法是有几种可能性的解读，受国内极端犹太复国主义的挟持，不得不做出这种反应；转移他自己面临的个人和执政方面普遍的不满情绪，还有将美国更深的拖入到中东地区的冲突中，利用美国的威慑力拿下更多的巴勒斯坦土地，后者这一点，完全不是美国的利益所在。</p><p></p><p>预估一下未来的发展：以色列因遭受哈马斯恐怖袭击所得到的同情和支持正在失去，他们不希望看到的反犹主义正在朝着相反的方向发展，同时他们国际上日益孤立（联合国大会中，反对停火的大国只有美国，欧盟许多国家已经开始公开表示了对以色列过度使用暴力的不满）阿拉伯国家对以色列的敌意升高，伊朗和土耳其已经明示有可能以军事方式卷入。做为北约成员国，土耳其的立场已经让情况变得更复杂。俄罗斯前总统梅德韦杰夫最近放话，俄罗斯将不得不与北约正面冲突，战争的规模将超过 1945 年的二战……中国正在利用这场危机扩大在该地区的影响力，并在西方联盟之外利用扩大版的金砖四国体系挑战美国，如果此刻美国民主党当政的政府处理不当，这将给川普更大的机会卷土重来，如是第三次世界大战的风险就会接近 70% 以上。</p><p></p><p>总之，内塔尼亚胡目前所做的一切，不仅他个人会付出代价，以色列也会付出代价，世界其它地区也会付出相应的代价。世界上没有一个重大的失误而无需付出代价的。只是这种代价通过战争来支付的话，那将是无数平民百姓的生命消逝，另外，它还会为将到而未到的更大的战争，更多的死亡铺平道路····</p><p></p><p>所以不要鼓吹暴力，人类祈求什么将会得到什么。</p><p></p><p>善用刀剑者将死于刀剑之下。历史已经反复证明过这一点，我们今天不需要再用更多，更新鲜的血再次证明这一点。</p><p></p><p>我：我的看法一直是折中的。即一方面不赞同美以极右派那种「消灭穆斯林」、「通过战争将独裁国家颠覆，且不惜平民伤亡代价」，但同时也不赞同极左反战人士「被恐怖袭击也不还手，用爱感化」，或者将第三世界对西方国家的攻击都视为文明冲突或者反殖民。</p><p>反恐是必要的，但打击要有定向和限度，更多要去改造和建设</p><p></p><p>很多事情还要具体分析区别对待。就像阿富汗战争和伊拉克战争，我就支持前者、反对后者。前者是高度教权专制、压迫女性和弱势族群，还包庇恐怖组织。而伊拉克虽然独裁，但萨达姆政权相对于沙特、敍利亚等其他国家，暴政并不突出。美国打击缺乏足够理由，弊大于利。但打了之后，那也就打了，但要做好善后</p><p></p><p>我相信慕容雪村先生的同情是真诚的，而不是卖人设。我也同意他在巴以问题上一些看法。</p><p>但有时候，他又用力过猛，一下子完全站在穆斯林立场，包括批判汉族、中国，不是客观中立，而是为反而反，一些行为又和中共五毛一体两面了。例如柴静拍穆斯林暴恐纪录片，他激动的表达担忧</p><p></p><p>就像我在柏林勃兰登堡门遇到的这些反战人士，反对军事援助乌克兰，认为以暴制暴不能带来和平。还有欧美一些核裁军人士，也认为自己国家要先放弃核武，才能促成无核化。我是很敬佩他们的。</p><p>但现实里，这真的能促成和平吗？你释放善意，未必得到对等对待，乃至让恶人更加得势。停止军援，普京会撤军吗？</p><p></p><p>我也去搞了活动劝说普京撤军、俄乌和平。我还写了长信敍述中俄友谊。但我也知道没什么用。普京不会听我的，也不会听哪怕各国总统的劝说，否则一开始就不会入侵乌克兰了。真正可能让普京退却的，只有在军事上击败他</p><p></p><p>小径残雪：一个欧洲阿拉伯人的质问。（内容是有人说阿拉伯人内部相互杀戮、腐败、专制，所以不应该仇恨犹太人，而要关注内部的不公不义）</p><p></p><p>我：显然对内对外要兼顾。而且涉及民族问题，那的确表达立场会更强烈一些。如果只对内不对外，那确实可以说是阿奸了。中共勾连苏联和日本，打国民政府，不也是这套说辞吗？</p><p></p><p>陈军：「王小山问慕容雪村，你说个不死平民抓哈马斯的方案出来？后者推脱说这是专业问题。但实际上这个问题很严厉，不具备可行性的方案是不解决问题也不会被真正的成本承担方所接纳的。」</p><p></p><p>我的回答：</p><p></p><p>这个角度把别的方案的可能性排除了。</p><p></p><p>以色列开始有很多选项，其中之一就是加快和沙特恢复关系（这首先不让哈马斯迫害中东和平进程的策略成功）另外，继续保持和阿联酋巴林友好关系（目前巴林已经驱逐了以色列大使），以色列从受害者的角色出发，让西方全部占在他们这一边，同时拉近本来中立一点的土耳其，埃及等国家，并利用阿拉伯国家的力量，孤立哈马斯，并让他们出面先解决人质问题。</p><p></p><p>换句话说，在危机面前，以色列先建立起联合阵线，让有些以色列自己办不成的事，比如解散哈马斯，交出首领等，交给其它中东国家出面去办。这样可以争取全世界的人心，也最大程度的孤立了哈马斯，同时找机会时定点清除他们的首脑，以达到他们最终」消灭」哈马斯的目的。</p><p></p><p>同时，以色列回到原来既定的两步方案，把两国建国的方案交给联合国投票解决。这样以色列不仅会在国际社会上赢得广泛的赞誉的支持，他们在中东地区性也因此会获得更大的领导力。</p><p></p><p>现在这个窗口还有，但机会似乎变得越来越渺茫……</p><p></p><p>我：你说的这些，以色列本来就一直在做。而且，这些正是哈马斯发动突击及赢得加沙人支持的重要原因。正是因为中东各阿拉伯国家于以色列改善关系、逐渐放弃对巴勒斯坦的支持，才导致巴以矛盾激化，以及哈马斯的绝望一击</p><p></p><p>我几个月前就评论过</p><p></p><p>沙以和解、沙伊和解，都居心不良。虽然局部有好处，但是对整体的和平大局，既没有根本改善，还坑了弱势群体。特朗普推动的沙以和解，为了对付伊朗，还坑了巴勒斯坦；中国推动的沙伊和解，罔顾两国人权问题，也回避巴勒斯坦问题。</p><p>去年和今年我写了两篇文章，都谈了</p><p></p><p>这两个和解坑的最惨的就是巴勒斯坦。以前沙以、阿以博弈，巴勒斯坦虽然是棋子，但是毕竟得到阿拉伯各国道义支持，不承认以色列就是支持之一。沙以和解、阿联酋巴林和以色列建交，等于把巴勒斯坦人抛弃了，几十年的原则付之东流。</p><p>沙伊和解，两国也不再指责对方国内人权、少数派权利自由，等于认同对方国内的镇压。例如沙特镇压国内什叶派包括处决教士；伊朗对内排斥逊尼派。</p><p></p><p>以前没和解，双方还制衡一下、呼吁和保护对面的弱势族群。现在和解了，并不是承诺保障好弱势群体。相反，对这些都不管了，乃至和解的代价就是默许对方镇压他们。还有双方也能心照不宣的共同压制女权运动什么的……</p><p></p><p>这就跟 1972 年、1990 年，中美中日关系正常化差不多，看起来好，其实代价就是不顾人权、不顾受害者、不顾历史，唯利是图、践踏弱者、进一步排斥边缘者……</p><p></p><p>「这一对「巴以」的建交，受伤最深的，是另一个「巴以」关系中的巴勒斯坦。巴林跟随阿联酋的步伐与以色列关系正常化，证实了「多米诺骨牌效应」的发生，巴勒斯坦得到「阿拉伯兄弟」的道义支持将越来越少。各国为自身利益和丛林法则，纷纷「弃巴亲以」，让近年来越发在巴以博弈中处于不利境地的巴勒斯坦雪上加霜。悲哀的是，这个趋势还将继续下去，「多米诺骨牌」将不可遏止的继续倒下，巴勒斯坦人民争取独立自由、民族解放的道路将更加漫长和绝望。」</p><p></p><p></p><p>我：起码当下人类社会环境里，求同情就像乞讨，不仅经常没用，得到了也不是好滋味。起码比以暴制暴滋味更痛苦。</p><p>不仅巴勒斯坦人这样想，其实对犹太人也一样。如果哈马斯袭击后以色列不攻击加沙，以纯粹受害者身份当然可以博取更多同情支持。但以色列选择以牙还牙，这说明以色列也觉得同情没什么用、滋味不好，而不如报复回去更爽。这从人道主义角度当然不对，但却是客观现实，也是各方受害者能深刻感知到</p><p></p><p>造谣、嘲笑弱势，中国的反贼，和中共是一回事。而且他们嘲笑敢于反抗的弱者，那大抵在中共体制下当顺民，比抗争人士更合他们胃口</p><p>（类似的东西我没有关注过，但是总是出现在推荐里。有些拉黑有些没拉黑，不拉黑是为了观察这些人的价值观、言行、心理。都拉黑就变成同温层了）（图片，推特上一些人造谣说五次中东战争都是巴勒斯坦挑起，以及嘲笑巴勒斯坦人弱还要反抗、「人菜瘾大」）</p><p></p><p>visegrad 24 ：（翻译）来自纽约市@CityCollegeNY 的视频</p><p></p><p>一名学生走到一群犹太学生面前，毁掉了他们张贴的关于被哈马斯绑架的以色列平民的海报。</p><p></p><p>西方大学教什么？（视频）</p><p></p><p>我：这非常不道德。支持巴勒斯坦的，贴自己的海报就行了，把别人的撕了算什么？</p><p></p><p>我：这位女性并不是为哈马斯杀害平民欢呼，只是支持加沙人民反抗以色列。当然在以色列看来是叛国，但她明知后果仍然敢于发声，也是一种民族情感和勇气。然后这些东西却嘲笑她。所以国人普遍都是这种不仅自己精致利己、还嘲笑勇于牺牲的人的畜生（图片，推特上一个亲以色列博主，嘲笑一位支持巴勒斯坦的巴裔以色列人，认为她被以色列逮捕和未来可能剥夺公民权是活该。评论区也一片附和）</p><p></p><p>有一个很为人忽视的事实：</p><p>本次袭击以色列、杀害妇女儿童的哈马斯成员，大多数已经被抓捕或击毙（且击毙占绝大多数），剩余的未来也大都会被以色列抓捕或击毙。</p><p>而反过来，轰炸、炮击、碾压，造成巴勒斯坦人包括妇女儿童死亡的以色列军人，99% 以上都安然无恙。</p><p>不仅本次如此，历次巴以冲突情况都是这样</p><p></p><p>陈军：请提供这方面的资料</p><p></p><p>我：维基百科显示，2500 哈马斯渗透到以色列，在以色列境内已击毙超过一千人。另有 200 人被捕。还有信息说超过 1500 哈马斯被击毙。这只是在以色列境内。以历史惯例，以色列肯定不会放过杀害以色列人尤其平民、妇女儿童的人，会定点清除、全球追杀。所以不超过两年，参与者应该都会死</p><p></p><p>而反过来，巴以冲突中，以军参战者的伤亡比率一般不超过 1%，且那些发射导弹、开飞机轰炸、开坦克碾压者，死亡率更低。</p><p>对于战争中杀害平民的行为，以色列官方一般都不会追究责任。即便是在非工作时期或者明显违背命令，还被国际抓包发现，也只是会判刑，一般是几年徒刑甚至更低。且被判刑的也是极少数</p><p></p><p>NBC：Israel says it killed 1,500 Hamas terrorists, pointing to a brutal fight ahead in Gaza</p><p></p><p>谁将十万横扫三江：怎么判断大多数已经被抓捕或击毙？不是说哈马斯死了不到一半吗</p><p></p><p>我：哈马斯攻击不到三日，以色列就报道有 1500 名攻入以色列的哈马斯成员被击毙。而且以色列也迅速报复了。</p><p>还有，过去也是这样，还会事后调查和定点清除。即便跑到外国也会被追击杀死</p><p></p><p>谁将十万横扫三江：见过很多人说，以色列军改后战斗力大幅度下降，不地面攻进加沙是打不过或者战损比不好看，这是真实的吗？如果能快速精准消灭哈马斯的话，战斗力应该不是描述的这样。还是说这些哈马斯是因为冲进了以色列人所在地区所以不需要分辨才能办到这一点</p><p></p><p>我：或许战斗力有下降，但打哈马斯肯定没什么问题。这两天以色列军队已经攻入加沙，加沙已经至少 9000 人死亡，以色列仅仅 20 人阵亡</p><p></p><p>谁将十万横扫三江：这个战损比应该是加上了加沙的普通人，以及，以色列并没有地面战，大多采用空袭取得估算的成果吧，每天看到很多战斗的图片和视频，但是没仔细去看，如果是你说的这样，那么说以色列军队拉跨的粉红们，反而更像是在帮助以色列打舆论战</p><p></p><p>我：是加上普通人，但是即便哈马斯和以军伤亡比，历史上大多数都是 10：1 至 100：1。以军战斗力下降应该是五毛粉红瞎说的，没有迹象表明以军战力有明显的、大幅的下降。五毛小粉红还说以色列军人每个月就拿 2000 人民币工资呢，你信吗？</p><p></p><p>我：其实如果提一个政治不正确、但是对巴勒斯坦人最有利的解决方案，就是各阿拉伯国家将加沙所有人都接走，加沙变成无人区。以色列如果非要占，就占吧。但加沙人脱离了大监狱，以色列也不再烦恼于加沙的火箭弹及其他麻烦。</p><p>不过这个前提是各阿拉伯国家愿意尽这个义务。其实融合一百万同文同种族群并不很难</p><p></p><p>巴勒斯坦人、以色列人/犹太人、阿拉伯人/穆斯林，三者的关系，和亚美尼亚人、土耳其和阿塞拜疆穆斯林、西方基督徒/基督教世界，这三者的关系，是非常类似的。</p><p></p><p>穆斯林之所以攻击亚美尼亚，也和当年十字军入侵有关。十字军做了恶跑路，亚美尼亚人成了穆斯林报复对象。这很不公平</p><p></p><p>阿拉伯人围殴犹太人，犹太人又欺负更弱的、同属阿拉伯的巴勒斯坦人。所以阿拉伯人应尽义务，接纳巴人在自己国家生活</p><p></p><p>我：那些反对巴勒斯坦反抗以色列的，一是回避以色列这些年对巴勒斯坦人的杀戮迫害，二是并不给一个可行的和平解决方案（更不用说亲自去做了）。以色列怎么做都不闻不问，巴勒斯坦人一反抗就骂了</p><p></p><p>我：加沙 60 万人，有 2.5 万哈马斯。中国要是有 7000 万反共游击队，哪还会有中共存在呢？</p><p></p><p>我：我反对以色列攻击加沙、杀伤巴勒斯坦平民，很大程度是因我不是以色列人、是中立者。所以看到以色列过度报复、滥杀无辜，以及加沙人民的惨状，非常同情。</p><p>但如果我是以色列人，看到同胞尤其妇女儿童被虐杀、己方战俘被处决、对方还拿纳粹大屠杀嘲笑自己族群，那我可能并不反对以色列十倍百倍的报复行为</p><p></p><p>Elsa：那如果你是巴勒斯坦人呢？</p><p></p><p>我：那我应该会比现在更加倾向于巴勒斯坦</p><p></p><p>唐丹鸿：（回答付志斌）你离哈马斯万里之外。我离哈马斯 70 公里。</p><p></p><p>傅志彬：理解，但以色列的领导人真的要考虑多一些，不然，后面更麻烦。失去了国际支持，以色列还能支撑多久想必你也明白。</p><p></p><p>唐丹鸿：你的思考完全不接我们的地气。你说的「国际支持」跟我们无关。</p><p></p><p>我：翻译一下：「我只关心我的家人、朋友、同事。其他人死活、考虑、情感，跟我有屁的关系。」</p><p>这话也可以完美的为新疆汉族支持再教育营背书</p><p></p><p>Dr. Anastasia Maria Loupis：（翻译）被占领的约旦河西岸的巴勒斯坦儿童受到以色列国防军士兵的骚扰，他们故意将孩子们扣在检查站，使他们上课迟到。孩子们变得沮丧，然后士兵用催泪瓦斯和眩晕手榴弹攻击孩子们。（视频）</p><p></p><p>Anne：你见过对只是儿童的群体使用催泪瓦斯的吗？</p><p></p><p>有！以色列政府！</p><p></p><p>「在被占领的巴勒斯坦西岸，巴勒斯坦儿童受到以色列国防军士兵的骚扰，这些士兵故意在检查站拦住孩子们，让他们上课迟到。孩子们变得沮丧激动，然后士兵们就用催泪瓦斯和强光和强声震撼手榴弹（非致命）攻击孩子们。」</p><p></p><p>我：中国公知还会说这些儿童是装可怜、博同情、未来也是恐怖分子。后半句可能判断对了，但难道不正是以色列从他们童年时就各种羞辱迫害，才逼的他们成了恐怖分子吗</p><p></p><p>屠夫吴淦：以色列和哈马斯关系有点像警方和绑匪关系，绑匪绑架了人质做要挟。普遍规则是警方把人质安全放在第一位，而不是为了消灭绑匪而不顾人质安全，如果绑匪没打死几个，人质却死一大片，很难说服人和得到支持，就像哈马斯无法被支持一样，当然绑匪死有余辜，活该被歼灭。说加沙民众活该，那不是正常人说的。</p><p></p><p>我：如果有人认为加沙民众因为支持哈马斯，所以不无辜。那么如何评价支持以色列军事行动、对以军杀害巴勒斯坦平民欢呼的以色列平民呢？还有为以军提供后勤及情感支持的以色列妇女儿童，按同样逻辑，是不是也是有罪的呢？（图片，一篇讲以色列封锁加沙恶行的文章，里边有以色列儿童为以军送食品等情节）</p><p></p><p>如果说加沙平民不无辜，同样的逻辑，这些专门开电报群欣赏和点赞炸死巴勒斯坦儿童视频的以色列人，是无辜的，还是有辜的？（图片）</p><p></p><p>Mia

2100 万中国人哀悼的事。日本没有一个在任首相去南京大屠杀遇难者纪念馆，有个别卸任的去了但也是个人身份且没有公开道歉。</p><p>这些好像中国公知和自由派都不提。大概他们心里中国人命不如日本人金贵</p><p></p><p>1949 年至今，除了少数时候（例如 2008 年前后），中国人就是国际贱民，不仅被外国人看不起，也被中国公知歧视，不能和正常国家国民有平等权利和人格。</p><p>在这些内外人士眼里，中国大陆人不配与外国人尤其日本欧美港台人有相同权利地位，在他们内心，把国人的利益、尊严、感受加以忽视或劣化，低人一等不止</p><p></p><p>Secretary Antony Blinken：（翻译）我会见了以色列反对派领袖@yairlapid

Anti：布林肯会见以色列反对党领袖讨论巴以问题，内塔尼亚胡不听话，就和反对党谈。</p><p></p><p>我：现在这局势和民意下，反对党恐怕也不愿意放弃强硬路线。即便是工党也是对外强硬派。蓝白党更硬，仅比利库德略微温和一点。真正反对的，可能只有那两个阿拉伯人政党了。但他们也不敢说什么，因为怕引火烧身</p><p></p><p>我：「民族是想象的共同体」，这句话和黑格尔的「存在即合理」一样，是译成中文者翻译错了，或者说翻译严重扭曲了原意。</p><p></p><p>正确的翻译是「民族是构建的共同体（不是天然形成，但也并非空想出来的，而是在现实合理基础上建构起来的））」。</p><p></p><p>而「存在即合理」，应该翻译为「凡是存在的都是有原因的（但并非一定是正确的、符合人道与正义的）」</p><p></p><p>小径残雪：根据 Zhang Heqing（这是真正的大外宣）的说法，CCTV 播出了一段以色列轰炸巴勒斯坦医院的视频，当然这个视频的真实背景是敍利亚政府/俄军 2016 年轰炸阿勒颇医院。本推要重申一下，近一个月在推上看见的所有以、哈非人道行为的视频，有三成是从敍利亚政府当年的视频里「化用」过来的。（图片）</p><p></p><p>我：这种造谣当然是错的。但同时也真有以色列对加沙平民包括医院的大规模轰炸，包括半岛电视台、BBC、CNN 等都有。既不能听信谣言，也不能因为有谣言。就把的确存在的以军攻击医院等平民目标行为遮掩了</p><p></p><p>程益中：当哈马斯发动恐怖袭击打死以色列妇女儿童老弱残疾和无辜平民的时候，人们谴责声讨哈马斯是正义的、必须的。当以色列无差别轰炸加沙地带，以更大规模的恐怖袭击，加倍屠杀巴勒斯坦妇女儿童老弱残疾和无辜平民的时候，人们呼吁停火，谴责以色列是以国家恐怖主义对抗恐怖主义组织，这也是正义的、必须的。</p><p></p><p></p><p>我：没错。但不仅如此。还有更前面的以色列长期封锁和轰炸加沙、扩建殖民定居点、剥夺加沙人自由发展和经济科技建设权利、对巴勒斯坦实施贫民弱民辱民政策……</p><p>如果忽视这些，好像哈马斯无缘无故去以色列杀人似的</p><p></p><p>David

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p></p><h3><strong>按：以下文章最初由敍利亚/瑞士学者和马克思主义国际主义者约瑟夫·达赫尔（&nbsp;Joseph Daher）于 2021 年 7 月 5 日在美国《暴风雨》（Tempest）网站上发表。作者感谢 Ashley Smith 和 Sai Englert 在文章撰写中提供的帮助。</strong></h3><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>以色列最近在以色列国内、约旦河西岸和加沙地带对巴勒斯坦人的袭击再次展现了锡安主义国家的残酷殖民主义、种族主义和类似种族隔离的本质。由极端民族主义者纳夫塔利·贝内特（Naftali Bennett）领导的新联盟取代以色列总理内塔尼亚胡政府，但这并不会改变巴勒斯坦人的处境。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>新政权的政策与内塔尼亚胡的政策没有什么不同。为了证明这一现实，贝内特在上台几天后就下令对加沙进行新的空袭。<strong>这些新的暴力与镇压行为证明了国际左翼必须毫无条件地支持巴勒斯坦的抵抗。</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>但是，我们也必须参与关于如何赢得解放以及我们在其中的作用的战略辩论。社会主义者应该将巴勒斯坦的斗争视为与中东和北非（MENA）反对该地区所有国家（尤其是以色列）的革命密不可分。将巴勒斯坦的抗争与区域内的革命相结合，是实现巴勒斯坦以及该地区所有人民自由的唯一现实方式。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>以色列：一个定居者殖民国家</strong></h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>锡安主义运动（The Zionist movement&nbsp;），其在欧洲的起源，经过 1948 年建立以色列国，到如今导致巴勒斯坦人的流离失所，始终是一个定居者殖民主义项目。为了确立、保持和扩张其领土，以色列国家不得不从他们的土地、家园和职业上对巴勒斯坦人进行种族清洗。在整个过程中，它与帝国主义列强结盟，并得到了帝国主义列强的支持，首先是大英帝国，然后是美国，后者在反对阿拉伯民族主义和社会主义的斗争中利用以色列作为代理人。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>因此，以色列国家对锡安主义定居者在谢赫贾拉（Sheikh Jarrah&nbsp;）对巴勒斯坦人住宅的侵占的支持，必须视作 1948 年导致超过 70 万巴勒斯坦人被迫离开家园的那场 Nakba（阿拉伯语「大灾难」）的持续。这一持续不断的殖民过程，是目前有超过五百万巴勒斯坦难民生活在中东和北非的难民营和城市中的原因。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>考虑到以色列彻底的反动本性，过去十年中，极右翼的政治霸权统治并不令人意外。从某种意义上说，这是锡安主义运动的合乎逻辑的产物......</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>现在，连主流团体也开始承认以色列殖民行为的反动本质。例如，人权观察和以色列的 B'Tselem 最近都谴责以色列持续掠夺巴勒斯坦土地。他们记录了以色列如何违反国际法，支持 62 万殖民者在被占领的约旦河西岸和东耶路撒冷地区建设殖民点。他们还断言，以色列是一个实行种族隔离制度的国家，赋予犹太人特殊权利，并使得巴勒斯坦人成为二等公民。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>鉴于以色列的极端反动性质，极右翼在过去十年中的政治霸权应该不足为奇。从某种意义上说，它是锡安主义运动、民族主义、以色列的制度性种族主义及其七十多年来对巴勒斯坦人的压迫和剥夺的合乎逻辑的产物。这些都为右翼锡安主义暴徒的蓬勃发展创造了条件，这些暴徒在巴勒斯坦社区游行，高呼「阿拉伯人去死」 （Death to Arabs）。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>与专制政权的错误联盟</strong></h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>就像殖民占领和种族隔离下的任何其他人群一样，巴勒斯坦人有抵抗的权利，包括采取军事手段。对这项权利的支持不应与对巴勒斯坦各政党政治观点的支持混为一谈。无论是法塔赫、哈马斯、伊斯兰圣战组织、巴勒斯坦人民解放阵线（PFLP）、巴勒斯坦民主解放阵线（DFLP）等，都没有提出能够实现巴勒斯坦解放的政治策略。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>主导的巴勒斯坦政党并不把巴勒斯坦大众、地区工人阶级和被压迫民众当作赢得解放的力量。相反，他们试图与该地区统治阶层及其政权结成政治联盟，以支持他们反对以色列的政治和军事斗争。即便这些政权在其境内压迫自己的民众和巴勒斯坦人，他们还是与之合作，并主张不干预。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>这种策略的演变中的一个关键例子是 1970 年的约旦，并在所谓的「黑色九月」事件中达到顶峰。尽管巴勒斯坦解放组织（PLO）在力量、组织和受欢迎度方面均表现突出，但在人口有七成是巴勒斯坦人的约旦，亚西尔·阿拉法特领导的法塔赫最初拒绝支持推翻国家独裁者侯赛因国王的运动。在得到美国和以色列的支持以后，作为回应，侯赛因宣布戒严，并且在阿拉伯地区政府基本保持袖手旁观的情况下，侯赛因攻击了巴解组织的营地，杀害了数千名巴勒斯坦战士和平民，并最终驱逐了巴解组织出境，使其进入了敍利亚和黎巴嫩。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>尽管有着这样的历史，以及随后在流亡中的经历，巴解组织几十年来仍旧坚持这种合作与不干预的策略。如今，巴勒斯坦自治当局（PA）主席马哈茂德·阿巴斯支持阿卜杜勒·法塔赫·塞西在埃及的独裁统治。在另一个令人震惊的例子中，尽管阿萨德残酷镇压了参与敍利亚起义的巴勒斯坦人，并摧毁了耶尔穆克难民营，但阿巴斯最近还是向敍利亚独裁者巴沙尔·阿萨德在 2021 年 5 月「再次当选」表示祝贺。</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>哈马斯也采取了类似的策略；其领导层与海湾国家的君主制国家，尤其是近来的卡塔尔，以及伊朗的原教旨主义政权结成了联盟。2012 年，当时担任加沙哈马斯政府总理的伊斯梅尔·哈尼耶赞扬了巴林的「改革」，与此同时，该政权在海湾盟友的支持下镇压了该国的民主起义。许多哈马斯领导人将其视为伊朗支持的巴林什叶派的「宗派」政变。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2018 年 4 月，哈马斯前领导人哈立德·马沙尔在访问安卡拉时赞扬了土耳其对敍利亚阿夫林的入侵和占领。他表示，「土耳其在阿夫林的成功是一个坚实的榜样」，希望这会被视为「世界许多地方伊斯兰乌玛取得类似胜利的希望」。土耳其武装部队及其在敍利亚的反动代理人占领了阿夫林，导致大约 20 万名库尔德人被驱逐，并镇压了那些留下的人。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>遗憾的是，巴勒斯坦左翼在很大程度上采用了与此相似的策略。它同样对盟友对其人民的压迫行为缄默不语。例如，人民阵线（PFLP）没有对敍利亚政权的罪行提出任何异议，反而支持其军队对抗‘外国阴谋’，声称大马士革‘将继续成为锡安主义敌人及其盟友面前的刺’。 人民阵线（PFLP）与伊朗的神权统治及埃及的军事独裁政权的关系，也呈现出类似的模式。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>政权背叛解放革命</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>该地区的专制国家非但没有推进革命，反而一再背叛革命，甚至镇压巴勒斯坦人。如前所述，约旦政府在 1970 年镇压了巴勒斯坦运动，在黑色九月期间杀死了数千人并驱逐了巴解组织。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1976 年，敍利亚的哈菲兹·阿萨德政权介入黎巴嫩事务，支持黎巴嫩极右翼政党，反对巴勒斯坦和左翼组织。他还在 1985 年和 1986 年对贝鲁特的巴勒斯坦难民营采取了军事行动。到 1990 年，大约有 2,500 名巴勒斯坦政治犯被关押在敍利亚监狱中。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>自 2007 年以来，埃及协助以色列对加沙地带实施封锁。伊朗投机取巧地试图利用巴勒斯坦事业作为外交政策工具，以实现其在该地区的更广泛目标。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>虽然敍利亚政权支持哈马斯，但在 2011 年拒绝支持该政权反对民主起义的反革命时，它大幅削减了对哈马斯的援助。伊朗只在伊斯梅尔·哈尼亚和萨利赫·阿鲁里被选为新领导后，才与哈马斯恢复了正式关系。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>德黑兰在阿富汗和伊拉克与美帝国主义合作。这就是为什么在最近的伊拉克起义中，抗议者在「既不是美国，也不是伊朗」的口号下游行。仅这些例子就摧毁了伊朗是巴勒斯坦事业的可靠盟友或是一个反帝国主义国家的想法。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>尽管雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安（Recep Tayyip Erdogan）批评以色列，但土耳其仍与以色列保持着密切的经济联系。埃尔多安将与特拉维夫的贸易额从上台时的 14 亿美元增加到 2020 年的 65 亿美元。因此，这些政权将他们对这一事业的支持限制在促进其地区利益的领域，并在不促进其地区利益的领域背叛它。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>美帝国主义斡旋的和平协议的死胡同</strong></h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>在依赖区域政权的政治支持和联盟战略失败后，巴解组织转而采取了更加走投无路的方式，那就是寻求美国和其他大国斡旋的和平协议。希望通过 1993 年达成的《奥斯陆协议》实现两国解决方案。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>这种解决方案不仅不会实现巴勒斯坦的解放，反倒等同于屈服，接受以色列在历史巴勒斯坦地区的殖民统治，而充其量只能赢得一个巴勒斯坦残余国家，并背叛巴勒斯坦难民返回他们在以色列被盗土地的权利。归根结底，和平进程使巴勒斯坦权力机构沦为统治完全由以色列控制的班图斯坦<a target="_blank"

href="https://matters.news/@MIAzh/%E5%B7%A6%E7%BF%BC%E7%9C%8B%E4%BB%A5%E5%B7%B4%E5%8D%B1%E6%9C%BA%E8%AF%91%E6%96%87%E8%BE%91no-16-%E5%B7%B4%E5%8B%92%E6%96%AF%E5%9D%A6%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%92%8C%E4%B8%AD%E4%B8%9C%E5%92%8C%E5%8C%97%E9%9D%9E%E9%9D%A9%E5%91%BD-palestinian-liberation-and-the-mena-revolutions-bafybeiaiznp3xhu674izmqnaxbbo2lg567lr7rogazltbrnhffibcaiswa#_ftn1">[1]</a>。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>这种灾难性的结果应该不足为奇。美国和其他帝国主义列强一直支持以色列作为其在本地的执法力量，以对抗该地区可能对他们控制产生挑战的革命性变革，这一事件将挑战他们对其战略能源储备的控制。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>以色列自建国以来一再达到这一目的。1956 年，在苏伊士运河国有化后，它参与了法国和英国对纳赛尔埃及的进攻。1967 年，以色列的六日战争在激进的民族主义阶段瞄准了纳赛尔的埃及和敍利亚国家。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>从那时起，美国一直支持以色列。华盛顿平均每年向特拉维夫输送 40 亿美元，支持其在巴勒斯坦的殖民活动以及对该地区进步政府和组织的侵略战争。华盛顿支持以色列于 1978 年和 1982 年对黎巴嫩的军事介入，这场介入导致了萨布拉和夏蒂拉恶劣的大屠杀，摧毁了进步的巴勒斯坦和黎巴嫩军队，并在贝鲁特建立了一个友好的政权。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>以色列对阿拉伯民族主义国家的胜利及其对黎巴嫩的干预导致该地区激进主义的后退，孤立了巴解组织。这一困境导致了亚西尔·阿拉法特的法塔赫派系在 1978 年采纳两国解决方案，这是其走向签署 1993 年《奥斯陆协议》的必要步骤。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>华盛顿平均每年向特拉维夫注入 40 亿美元，支持其殖民巴勒斯坦以及对该地区进步政府和运动发起的侵略战争。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>实际上，这意味着放弃历史性解放巴勒斯坦的斗争，并将法塔赫转变为管理被占领土的巴勒斯坦权力机构。反对《奥斯陆协议》的巴勒斯坦知识分子爱德华·赛义德（Edward Said）宣称，该协议代表了「对原则、巴勒斯坦历史的主要潮流和国家目标的大规模放弃」，并「将散居海外的巴勒斯坦人降级为永久流亡或难民身份」。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>美国和以色列一直支持巴勒斯坦权力机构控制约旦河西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人（在后者于 2007 年被哈马斯接管之前）。巴勒斯坦权力机构很高兴担任华盛顿和特拉维夫的警察。例如，在最近的起义中，巴勒斯坦权力机构逮捕了 20 多名活动人士，因为他们在社交媒体上发帖并领导抗议活动。最近，巴勒斯坦主要活动家和巴勒斯坦权力机构的批评者尼扎尔·巴纳特（Nizar Banat）在希伯伦杜拉（Dura）的家中遭到安全部队的突袭。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>随着巴勒斯坦权力机构作为一个狡猾的政权发挥作用，美国促进了以色列与该地区国家的政治和经济一体化，最近通过特朗普政府的亚伯拉罕协议。以色列与几个阿拉伯国家之间关系的正常化，这进一步孤立了巴勒斯坦的解放斗争。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>新当选的总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）重申了华盛顿对以色列的坚定支持，无论以色列对巴勒斯坦人犯下什么罪行。在对加沙最近的轰炸中，国会通过了向以色列出售 7.35 亿美元的精确制导武器的协议，而每年数十亿美元的援助也将继续涌入。巴勒斯坦权力机构与美国合作的战略需要向占领者及其帝国赞助商投降。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>巴勒斯坦工人阶级的软弱</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>如果基于该地区国家和美国斡旋的和平协议的战略是死胡同，那么对巴勒斯坦工人阶级的另一种取向呢？这一点也被以色列作为定居者殖民国家的特殊性质所排除。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>与种族隔离的南非不同，南非的工厂和矿山依赖黑人工人的劳动，以色列将巴勒斯坦工人赶出了其经济中的任何核心角色，取而代之的是犹太工人。因此，巴勒斯坦工人没有办法像南非的黑人工人那样通过罢工来关闭以色列经济。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>这并不意味着巴勒斯坦抵抗运动在以色列国内以及被占领的西岸和加沙地带无能为力。其他团体工人的斗争仍然是运动的核心。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>巴勒斯坦最近的斗争浪潮显示了它的力量和潜力，可以制定一项新的战略，以取代依赖该地区政权支持的失败战略。新的青年和女权主义团体，如塔拉特（Tal’at），以及工人阶级，一直是最近抵抗运动的核心。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5 月 18 日的工人总罢工是自下而上召集和领导的。它关闭了从以色列到约旦河西岸和加沙地带的部分经济。正如《国土报》所指出的那样：「以色列建筑商协会观察到巴勒斯坦工人参观了罢工，六万五千名巴勒斯坦建筑工人中只有 150 人来到以色列工作。这导致建筑工地瘫痪，造成估计为 1.3 亿谢克尔（近 4000 万美元）的损失。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>虽然罢工的性质极其重要，但不应过分夸大其影响。正如在约旦河西岸定居点工业区组织巴勒斯坦人的唯一以色列工会——MAAN 工人协会的主任阿萨夫·阿迪夫所指出的，巴勒斯坦在以色列工作的人遵守罢工在某种程度上是「由于检查站的关闭和约旦河西岸道路上的不确定性」。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>无论参与罢工的广度如何，以色列经济都相对毫发无损，这表明巴勒斯坦工人阶级和其他社会运动需要其他工人、农民和被压迫人民的声援。问题是巴勒斯坦人应该以哪些为导向，以在历史悠久的巴勒斯坦赢得世俗民主。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>以色列工人阶级——不是战略盟友</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>第一个也许是显而易见的战略方向似乎是以色列工人阶级。但它始终将对以色列的忠诚高于与巴勒斯坦大众的阶级团结。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>这不仅是意识形态奉献的结果，而且是对以色列国家的物质利益的结果，以色列国家为以色列工人提供了从巴勒斯坦人那里偷来的房屋以及膨胀的生活水平。因此，以色列统治阶级和国家将以色列工人阶级纳入作为共同定居者殖民主义项目的合作者。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>它的工人阶级机构，如其工会，Histadrut，在巴勒斯坦的种族清洗中发挥了核心作用。锡安主义工党领导人于 1920 年建立了一个 Histadrut，作为一个完全犹太人的工会，并用它来带头使巴勒斯坦工人流离失所。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>其口号「犹太土地、犹太工作、犹太产品」概括了它的民族主义阶级合作项目，并凸显了它与巴勒斯坦人团结的根本敌意。在以色列建国期间和建国后应用这些口号，它帮助确保土地只租给犹太人;农场和工业只雇用犹太人;巴勒斯坦的农场和工业遭到抵制。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>此外，以色列国家通过强制性征兵使以色列工人军事化的程度加深。这迫使他们参与对巴勒斯坦人的镇压，强化占领，并为锡安主义者占领巴勒斯坦人的房屋和土地辩护。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>考虑到这种纳入殖民项目的情况，工人们支持对加沙的最新袭击（除了极少数例外）也就不足为奇了。以色列电力公司（IEC）的工会甚至宣布，在两名以色列士兵和一名失踪的以色列平民被遣返之前，它不会修复通往加沙地带的电力线。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>这是否意味着巴勒斯坦人不应该寻求与以色列工人阶级的进步部门合作？ 当然不是。小规模团结的例子是存在的，但很少见。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>很难想象这些会成为以色列工人与锡安主义国家民族主义团结的压倒性模式的对立面。因此，专注于尝试在以色列和巴勒斯坦工人之间建立反对锡安主义的工人阶级团结的策略是不切实际的。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>区域革命战略</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>制定更好的解放战略的关键是将巴勒斯坦置于区域背景下。由于数以百万计的巴勒斯坦难民融入中东，并且在一定程度上融入北非，他们的民族和阶级斗争自然与该地区大众的斗争紧密相连。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>这些工人和农民铭记着他们的先辈反抗殖民主义的斗争，面对支持压迫他们的政权的帝国主义势力，与巴勒斯坦人的斗争产生共鸣，因此他们将自己争取民主和平等的战斗视为与巴勒斯坦的胜利紧密相连。这就是斗争之间相互影响、相互作用的原因；当巴勒斯坦人奋战时，它激发了整个地区的解放运动，而这些地区的运动又反哺于被占领的巴勒斯坦的斗争。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>他们的联合起义有力量转变整个地区，推翻政权，驱逐帝国主义列强，结束这些力量对以色列国的支持，在这个过程中削弱以色列，并向以色列工人证明地区性转型能终结他们的被剥削状态。极右翼部长阿维格多·利伯曼（Avigdor Lieberman）承认，2011 年的阿拉伯之春给以色列带来的危险，在他看来，推翻了胡斯尼·穆巴拉克并为民主敞开大门的埃及革命，比伊朗对以色列构成了更大的威胁。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>这一区域战略的力量和潜力已一再得到证明。在 1960 年代和 1970 年代，巴勒斯坦运动刺激了整个地区的阶级斗争。2000 年，第二次起义开启了抵抗运动的新时代，激发了一波组织浪潮，最终在 2011 年爆发了从突尼斯到埃及再到敍利亚的革命。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2019 年夏季，黎巴嫩的巴勒斯坦人在难民营组织了持续数周的大规模示威，抗议劳工部将他们当作外国人的决定，这一举措在他们看来是形式上的歧视和种族主义。他们的抵抗激发了 2019 年 10 月更广泛的黎巴嫩起义，这反过来又导致了伊拉克的民众起义。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>斗争之间有一种辩证关系;当巴勒斯坦人战斗时，它触发了区域解放运动，而区域运动又反馈到被占领的巴勒斯坦运动中。他们的联合起义有能力改变整个地区......</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>为了实行基于这种区域团结的战略，巴勒斯坦团体和运动必须放弃由巴勒斯坦权力机构、哈马斯以及大多数左翼所接受的不干涉该地区国家事务的政策。这种不干预是获得各种政权援助的先决条件。接受这一政策意味着切断巴勒斯坦人与可以帮助他们赢得解放的社会力量的联系。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>相反，巴勒斯坦的斗争需要重新采纳左翼分子在 1960 年代追求的那种区域性革命战略。不幸的是，多数人放弃了这一战略，转而盲目追随巴解组织与该地区的反动国家结盟。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>基于基层阶级斗争的区域革命战略，是从以色列到沙特阿拉伯、敍利亚乃至他们的帝国主义支持国，从美国到中国和俄罗斯的解放之路的唯一途径。在这场斗争中，巴勒斯坦人和其他国家的人们必须支持所有遭受民族压迫的群体的诉求，像库尔德人一样，以及那些遭受种族、宗派和社会其他形式压迫的人们。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>现在是恢复区域战略的时候了。整个中东和北非都处于一个长期的革命进程中，这个进程根源于群众被挫败的政治和经济抱负。已经发生了两波起义，第一次是在 2011 年，震撼了整个地区，第二次是在 2018 年和 2019 年，席卷了苏丹、黎巴嫩、阿尔及利亚和伊拉克。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>由于民众的诉求未得到满足，第三波起义无疑正在酝酿之中。巴勒斯坦能够并且必须站在这一轮解放自己以及整个地区斗争的前沿中心。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>革命进程中的巴勒斯坦</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>只有通过这一区域革命战略，我们才能设想在历史悠久的巴勒斯坦建立一个民主、社会主义和世俗的国家，在整个中东和北非的社会主义联邦中，巴勒斯坦人和犹太人享有平等的权利。在新的巴勒斯坦国家里，所有巴勒斯坦人将有权回到他们在 1948 年、1967 年及以后被迫离开的土地和家园。除此之外，巴勒斯坦的解放还必须包含一个全球性的经济发展与重建项目，以确保巴勒斯坦人民的社会与经济权利得到保障。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>为了实施这一战略，巴勒斯坦人必须铸造一个新的政治领导层，致力于在历史悠久的巴勒斯坦及该区域内部自下而上地自我组织。他们不能孤立行动，而必须通过与埃及、黎巴嫩、敍利亚、伊朗、土耳其、阿尔及利亚以及其他所有国家的社会主义者的合作来完成这一目标。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>对于地区之外的人来说，最重要的任务是争取左翼、工会、进步组织和运动支持对以色列的抵制、撤资和制裁运动。在帝国主义列强尤其是美国的机构和企业中强制执行这一运动，将有助于阻断它们对以色列和其他专制政权的支持，削弱它们在该地区的影响力。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>因此，巴勒斯坦的解放必须经过解放生活在大马士革、利雅得、多哈、德黑兰、安卡拉、阿布扎比、开罗、安曼以及其他所有暴君统治下的人民。正如一位敍利亚革命者在

                <![CDATA[<p>从黄山回来的第二天，我从京东买了两台笔记本电脑，一台红米 Book14，一台 HP 税 Pro14。这两台里的其中一台，是注定要被退货的，下单两个，只是为了不要跑电脑城，在家里就能比较。怀疑这样做有点剥削快递小哥，以及那些装箱打包做了无用功的人。但，是的，对不起。</p><p>许久没当揹包客了，能记得的，还是在 2018 年。那年春节后和朋友们一道去北海，下飞机看他们一水行李箱，只有我背个双肩包，打趣说你们好像女明星，我像助理。</p><p>自那以后，我也拖行李箱了，再没背过包。行李箱在平整的地面上占尽优势，几乎没有软肋。唯一的问题是噪音。有时凌晨出发，或者深夜到达，行李箱的滚轮滚过地面，轰隆隆雷鸣一样，让人有点尴尬。尴尬啥呢？当然是怕搅扰别人的好梦。这点上，我觉得我像日本人，愿意守文明社会的规矩，需要和人保持距离，生怕打扰到别人……</p><p>这次黄山行，因为计划中要去的地方比较多，黄山、宏村、西递等，都不大适合拖箱子，而又有些怀念起以前揹包走天下的那种自由的感觉，正好有天晚上和朋友们吃完饭逛迪卡侬，揹包顺手就买了。40L，只要不露营，足够了。最重要，这包还可以装电脑。</p><p>最近几年常拖箱子出门，也是因为每次出门总要带电脑，指不定就有工作的事情找上门来。有些时候运气好，带了不一定用得上。但不带不行，出不了门。别看我好像整天到处跑，自由地了不得，事实上，牵着你的东西很多。爬黄山那天，老板上午安排工作时，我还在索道门口排长队。给他说我堵在黄山，晚上才能做。他回我，好。但我想，大概肚子在冒烟，不好发作。他对我的不好发作，和我对他不好拒绝一样。于是粘粘糊糊，夹缠不清。晚上六点多才到酒店，吃完饭七点多，精疲力尽双腿打颤，还不得不加班搞事。</p><p>话说那晚住的全季，可能是旅游区，多少有点应付游客，大床房的床是两张单人床拼成的。目测是两张 1.5 米的单人床，拼后变成 3 米，能睡四五个人。真浪费，我发了个动态说。有人评论说那被套可不好套。可不是？他们不好套，我也不好盖，晚上想要卷一下被子，只能朝一边，另外一边，卷不到头。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/23c35cbb-86cc-4095-88cd-091a3fffa24e.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>第二天逛宏村时，甚至两次停下脚步在咖啡馆弄临时找上来的工作。花的时间倒不多，但影响心情，进而影响节奏。加上体力被前两天的高强度运动耗得七七八八，揹包沉重，使得我心心念念很多年的宏村之行，草草收场。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b67f9de9-5792-4fb9-bae8-385186b2339b.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>宏村的湖边、街巷，到处都是写生的学生，吃饭的时候，这些画夹前就空了，只留下画板。</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/e00c5056-52da-40c6-bf59-8c6743999139.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>宏村</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/40f4c839-3545-4079-98b3-2ec65ab42e8a.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>宏村</figcaption></figure><p>相对来讲，不怎么出名的呈坎，要比名声在外的宏村感觉好一些。我在呈坎住了一夜，行李放在客栈，不用揹着。呈坎人少，不像宏村那样扰攘。下午在客栈的天台读书，除了客栈的工作人员偶尔上来晒床单，没有其它人打扰。傍晚时，村外的山边，炊烟四起。有一个山头，完全笼罩在烟雾里，像是起了火。让我想起小时候，母亲傍晚烧炕，遇连日阴雨，柴火被水浸湿，不容易点着，沤成的浓烟，笼满整个窑洞。得把门帘在门扇上搭起来，也得半天方散。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/53e41191-6f04-4bf4-bcb8-45ec7b02faf0.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>呈坎</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ddeda8a1-d5f8-4968-b955-d02775ab89f4.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>呈坎的天台读一本有关红楼梦的书，从二手书店淘来的，很有历史特色的语言，辛酸又好笑</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/60fa651a-6abb-4362-bc5e-418cddfb6f8c.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>傍晚时的炊烟</figcaption></figure><p>但呈坎的客栈是败笔，去哪儿上评价很好，住进去才发现，窗子外面在盖房子，白天吵吵闹闹，睡不着觉。晚上倒是安静，八九点时，远处有人放烟花，正好绽放在在建楼房的窗洞里。那晚看 WTA 珠海小年终的比赛，又写日记，很晚才睡，关灯时发现床顶有个壁灯关不掉。太晚不好找店家来，只好囫囵睡了几个小时，一大早起床走了，连客栈的免费早餐也没吃。</p><p>呈坎有个特点，是我在其它地方没见过的。那就是很多村民拦路拉客，要给你当导游，都是大妈，头发花白，声音洪亮，远远就冲着你喊：我给你讲解？只要二十块钱，里面很大，迷宫一样，你自己要迷路，还看不懂，嗳嗳，这边，那边是民房，没有景点，嗳，你看嘛，说你要迷路……有两次，有人追在身后，夹缠不清，差点发火，才悻悻而去。</p><p>是很久没揹包肩背不太习惯了吧，这次到后来，像是孙悟空背的那个大石头，觉得越来越重，遂下定决心换个轻点的电脑。旧电脑用了六年多，当时一心想要大屏，带数字键盘。六年来用着还算顺手，一夕之间，觉得非换不可，轻便就好，屏幕可以小，数字键盘也可以不要了。</p><p>在小米和 HP 之间游移不定，看上小米小巧的电源，又不舍 HP 的体验。纠结不下，把心一横，都买，买来放一起比对，哪个更有眼缘就留下哪个。最终还是留下了 HP，也因为我发现，用小米的电源也可以给 HP 充电，那不就单独买个电源的事？淘宝多的是替代产品。</p><p>于是就想啊，你 HP 既然能用小的电源适配器，那原装电源又何苦还做得那么粗笨？把这问题抛给朋友，他说那些外国品牌一贯傲慢的嘛，又不像国产品牌这么会做表面文章讨好大多数。</p><p>我想，也许也还有个惯性或者惰性的问题。像是舒适圈，有时明知道往外跨一步更好，但圈里待著舒服啊。直到某天，外力逼迫，不得不改。</p><p><br class="smart"></p>

href="https://www.wainao.me/wainao-reads/existential-crisis-in-civil-service-exam-frenzy-10232023">《自述：存在主义危机，曾促使我从体制中逃离》</a></p><figure class="image"><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>图片：歪脑设计组</figcaption></figure><p>经济前景暗淡的年代，中国居高不下的考公考编热已成为时代景观。年轻人扎堆去卷体制内工作的原因众所周知——面对竞争激烈、收入缩水、工作难找、社会保障差的现实，只有体制才能提供一个安稳、可预期的「庇护所」。然而，如果这「庇护所」本身就是促成经济问题的因素，又怎么指望其中的人可以独善其身呢？</p><h2>庞大编制带来的沉重负担</h2><p>最近，公务员、事业编制「缩编」的<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://news.ifeng.com/c/8SzJP3XFHyh">新闻</a></strong>引起了广泛关注，也给想要赶上这股潮流的人亮起了红灯。中国广泛存在行政机构和事业单位编制沉冗、财政供养人员过剩的问题。为支付超比例的政府雇员的工资，地方政府常常面临入不敷出的压力，「借钱」发工资的消息屡见不鲜。沉重的供养负担使得本来就债务高企的地方财政雪上加霜，无以为继。近几年，国家为了消化地方债务，正在推动一系列财政重整措施，其中一项要求就是机关事业单位「缩编」。</p><p>专家认为，中央对地方债务的介入有助于推动解决顽固的编制沉冗问题，却未必能够为年轻人的考公考编热降温。因为缩编只是意味着「铁饭碗」不再牢固，却「并没有从根本上改变体制内工作相对于体制外工作的优越性。」另外，由于大量的扩招，很多年轻人上的大学、学的专业质量堪忧，毕业后在社会上很难有就业机会。</p><p>「如果这些大学生在个人层面，在上大学期间一直没有发现自己的兴趣和天分，也未能掌握实用的技能或获得一定经验，或者一句话，还没有找到适合自己做的事情，那么说实在的，用足作为一名应届毕业生的优惠条件去争取考编「上岸」，在目前的经济和就业形势下仍然不失为一个合理的选择，因为机会成本本来就不是太大。」</p><p>个体在有限条件下的选择固然无可厚非。然而我们不禁要问，中国的「体制」为何成为了这样的怪物？它圈养着太多没有目标，只求安全的年轻人，不断再生产着他们的无能，荒废着他们的生命，最终自己也膨胀成一个危害全社会健康的肿瘤。无论对于国家还是对于个人来说，体制的建构（以及参与其建构）都是一个作茧自缚的故事。要从这厚重的茧房里破茧而出，不经历脱胎换骨之痛，恐怕难以获得新生。</p><h2>体制：当代中国的初始设定</h2><p>我身边一些自由主义朋友有种很天真的想法，觉得随着国内经济越来越差，社会矛盾凸显，蔓延至身边的灾难变多，现在仍认同体制的人会「被教做人」，他们会被激起反抗，或者至少，有所醒悟。</p><p>现实正好相反。在中国的语境下，环境越差，权力对资源的垄断和分配能力就越占主导，个体的自主空间就越小。对于大多数普通人来说，就越需要依附权力去获取必要的保障。而这种「自主空间」并不仅仅是指物质生活空间，精神空间也会缩小。也就是说，恐怕人们不仅不会「醒悟」，反而会更加认同体制。</p><p>疫情后的考公考编热多少已能佐证这一点。在笔者小时候，改革开放重启后的 90 年代，经济的蓬勃发展随着「解放思想」的号召，「下海」才成为全民热潮。</p><p>当然，不必嘲笑这些自由主义朋友，这些黄金时代的遗孤。他们之所以这么想，是因为他们还保有自由的心智。他们总是相信人的能动性——如果遭到压迫，便要去冲撞桎梏，怎么能逆来顺受？所以他们是有能力脱离这片土地的人，不管是在精神还是肉身上。</p><p>人们常常把体制形容成「围城」，而体制所制造的「围城」是权力垄断资源的结果。</p><p>「改革开放前，中国还在计划经济的时期，中国人都属于特定的单位，并且专属于特定的单位，个人既没有实际的政治权利，也没有独立的经济信用，就连消费也只能按照票证规定的数量和品种购买和分配。那种因为具有多样、不确定和灵活的属性而可以称为「社会」的空间微乎其微。」北京大学教授高丙中教授<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.chinanews.com.cn/gn/news/2009/01-19/1532791.shtml">如是说</a></strong>，他所在的公民社会研究中心在 2009 年发布了《中国公民社会发展蓝皮书》。当时参与其编纂的 20 多位学者一致认为，中国已经迈进公民社会。</p><p>现在的年轻人理所当然把改革开放当成中国的「初始设定」，但实际上，体制才是当代中国的初始设定。改革开放后，体制之外出现了市场；随着市场经济的兴起，人们拥有了私人领域；而私人领域孕育了人的独立自主意识；自由人通过自由的联合组成「公民社会」——这些才是新进概念。</p><p>而这些新进概念已然「过时」。当国家力量无度扩张，资源分配过多地受到行政力量的影响，那么国家自然会成为最大的剥削者，挤压市场和私人领域的利益，并试图控制社会和个人的方方面面。老百姓只有成为它的一份子，才有渠道分得一杯羹。体制要维持这种特权，自然需要推高其进入门槛，于是，国家每年都制造出千军万马过独木桥的奇观，从中遴选出一整个「特权阶级」。</p><p>当然，体制并不是中国特产，美国和其他资本主义国家同样也有「体制」——政府的行政机构和公共服务机构，大学、军队等系统也相对独立于市场和社会。它们依靠公共财政维持运作，很少受到市场的干预，资源也很少与社会流通。但区别是，这些体制背后的国家力量并不垄断社会资源，体制内的工作也不存在那么强的权力光环。所以体制对人们的吸引力有限，进入的门槛也并不高。毕竟在公权力之外，还有同样壮大的资本市场和公民社会，它们呈现三足鼎立的状态，便得以互相制衡和监督。一个离开了大学或军队的美国人同样面临重新适应社会的落差，但不至于在体制之外就没有足够的资源和空间去生存、发展。</p><p>近些年，将自己的痛苦境遇归因于「万恶资本家」的年轻人，或许不能算错。毕竟国家控制的资本也算是资本，党的权贵阶层也会是掌握国家经济命脉的资本家。不是说民营企业家就不会「作恶」，而是应该质问为什么这个国家的法律、劳工权利与社会保障体系无力应对资本带来的问题，而谁又是能够免于监督的？另外，很多极左或极右的人都缺乏一种分析「语境」的智慧——事物的性质要看其关系、看其比例。权力的问题往往不在于自身的好坏，而在于互相的平衡和制衡。当国家机器的权力过大，资本必然与其苟合，孱弱的民众只能沦为二者收割的韭菜。</p><p>对于曾经改革开放盛期的中国来说，去区分体制内外是有意义的，但一个极权化的国家其实不存在体制外的空间。不是政府机构、事业单位、国企才叫体制，如今的中国就是个以国家为单位的巨大「体制」。因为整个社会已经被国家机器牢牢困住，越发没有自主的空间——独立 NGO、独立新闻媒体、民间组织、集会等都难以生存，甚至每个人都难以捍衞自己的私人领域和身心自主界限。</p><p>当这个体制承诺为社会提供依靠和庇护的时候，我们应该看到，正是这个体制给社会造成了困境，也正是它与资本主义的暗面同流合污。</p><h2><strong>所谓的「上岸」其实会把人溺死</strong></h2><p>普通人在这样的社会里很难找到出路。人们总把考进体制称为「上岸」，仿佛暗示了一劳永逸的解脱和「从此以后」的幸福生活。然而，体制内却又是另一场无望的煎熬，抱怨体制内的工作令人压抑和麻木、令人感觉「浪费生命」的声音同样尖锐。</p><p>纵观那些从体制辞职之人的自述，他们最常提到的问题包括：行政化、政治化、官僚化过于严重，和专业无关的事务太多；人变成了螺丝钉，唯领导是从，无法发挥自己的特长和能力；按部就班，千篇一律的工作，找不到成就感和意义；低效、平庸的氛围，做多做少都一样，没有发展空间；在体制里也并不轻松，做事不自由又无法掌控自己的时间……</p><p>体制内的人需要承受体制的问题，特别是当体制和人——和人的性格、理智、价值观、道德直觉等特质相矛盾的时候，尤其令人痛苦。</p><p>一位曾经在上海某大学当老师的作者乔葭兰记录了他教书十年后的<strong><a

href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/676260.html">辞职经历</a></strong>，这篇文章火爆全网却又被很快封杀。作者称其教学和学术自由受到了太多政治干预，学生也因为大环境的影响而变得急功近利、无法容忍异议。好不容易遇到个别热情求知的学生来面试，却被学校领导歧视、拒之门外。</p><p>「近年高校思想控制更深入，每门课大纲和教案重改，必须加入三个以上思政知识点，让人反感，后来发展到为节课都要有思政内容，‘课程思政’由前几年的个别老师申请项目拿经费，发展到百分之百覆盖，每位老师都要把自己的课跟思政联结。</p><p>去年有一次课间，突然后门进来一位教务督导老师落座来巡查听课，课下走到讲台与我交谈，问怎么没听到思想政治的内容，我糊弄说您来前刚刚讲过，当时我班上的前几排学生马上应和，帮我糊弄搭腔，心照不宣，相视而笑。」</p><p>我对他的经历很有共鸣。因为我曾经也在家乡当大学老师，教建筑设计，后来下定决心辞职出国读书，从此一去不回头。当时学校的政治化并未那么严重，但行政凌驾于教学乃是常态。</p><p>我刚开始上课的时候对教学抱有极大热情，因为发现班上的学生普遍基础不好，我和另一个搭课的老师就利用课余时间，费尽心思为他们制定补充教学和练习内容，学生的反响非常好，一些有天赋的孩子进步神速。但是没过多久，我们就因为教授「超出课程大纲」的内容而被另一个班的学生和老师举报到学校，课程被叫停，我们甚至被调查和约谈。</p><p>后来，我发现老师连一些基本的自主权都被干涉，比如说给不合格的学生挂科，副院长会打电话来劝：「不要挂太多，分数要给高一点，否则学生成绩不好看，也影响我们系将来过评估。」末了还加上一句：「这也是为了保护你们老师。」有时就连一个普通辅导员，都可以打电话来要求给关系好的学生改分。而那些懂得配合领导的议程，却不管学生的老师，获得了最多的赏识。</p><p>但平心而论，比起高校稳定、悠闲的工作氛围，这些小烦恼都不算什么，我很快就习惯了得过且过，也变成了一个会划水、敷衍了事的人。等我回过神来的时候，我已经深陷进怠惰的泥沼里无法自拔。我年纪轻轻就停止了成长，感受不到工作的意义，也不知道自己为什么活着。我陷入了一种慢性的抑郁状态中，日复一日，对未来感到绝望。</p><p>让我最困惑的就是，为什么我明明过得非常痛苦，周围的人却还都说好，羡慕我拥有编制和全民默认的「女性最佳职业」，父母也为我的「完美到站」而心满意足。一开始，我也告诫自己不要「身在福中不知福」。后来，我怀疑这就是一个巨大的谎言——这就是中国中产们从小为孩子所构建的「幸福生活」？简直可笑。</p><p>我尝试了各种「自救」，读书、健身、写作、养猫养狗、揹包旅行……但这些活动都未能安抚我的焦虑、将我重新激活。我觉悟到，如果我还想继续停留在安全区里，不愿承担任何风险，只敢通过消费去获取消遣，所谓的「自我提升」就是自欺欺人而已。</p><p>现在我明白了，真正促使我离开的是一种存在主义危机。我看过一些人在四十、五十岁的年龄从体制里出走，他们突然推翻了之前的人生，彻底改变轨道。这个「体制」不仅仅是指公职，而是他们一直以来的主流式生活。他们辞职、离婚、移民、重新求学……决定去做自己一直以来渴望的事。因为在生命走向衰老甚至死亡的时候，人总会升起一种紧迫的冲动——他们想真实地活着，他们想去真实的世界，因为他们想去寻找、实践真实的自我。</p><p>只是，当人生已过去大半，出走的成本也变得过大。我很幸运，在三十出头的时候感受到了这种冲动，并选择相信自己的感受。我听不进所有人的规劝，甚至和爸妈大吵一架，也非离开不可。在别人看来这只是任性，但对于我来说，这是生死攸关的决定。</p><h2>家庭往往就是体制的前线</h2><p>七年的时间一晃而过，离开时的心情仍记忆犹新。如今我已习惯了加拿大的生活，交到一些如家人般的朋友，做着自己热爱的工作。这只是普普通通的人生，再也比不上我曾在国内拥有过的一切，但却是我拼尽全力获得的。</p><p>在这段旅程中，我曾经意气风发，而后颠沛流离，也有过跌入谷底的时期，历经打击之后再也不复年少轻狂。但回过头看，它堪称一段非凡的英雄之旅，我遇到的人、经历的事和他们带给我的启发，都是曾经身在体制里的自己无法想象的。这一切都让我认识了我，并最终成为了我。我生命中珍贵的东西，也在这个过程里水落石出。</p><p>正因为亲自走过了一遭，我更明白要成功脱离体制，以及脱离被体制化的生活是多么困难。要应对自由所伴随的巨大不确定性，除了自身不懈的挣扎，还有赖于很多「特权」和运气。我的父母虽然一开始不同意我的选择，后续却给了我毫无保留的支持，在我每次失败的时候，他们都没有借机奚落，也从不旧事重提，只是鼓励我重振旗鼓，去做下一次尝试。但我也不会忘记，是我的「固执己见」重启了人生，我为我当初没有交出自己而骄傲。当我上路的时候，他们因着对我的爱，也不得不随着我学习、成长、调整心态和眼界，然后才渐渐和我走到了一起。</p><p>如前所说，中国是一个巨大的体制，这片土地上世世代代的「老中」，远在我们想要考公考编之前，远在我们进入社会之前，我们就已经在被体制规训。国家与家庭的一以贯之，意味着家庭往往就是规训的前线。如果父母对体制缺乏反思，那么这些规训都将以亲缘为渠道，以爱为名行之，其效果也超过国家机器。</p><p>说到家庭的规训，王路的文章<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.douban.com/note/850727749/">《也值一个屁》</a></strong>令我印象深刻，他讲了自己热爱体育的外甥被迫去考大学，结果考砸的故事。由此指出，中国父母总是传递给孩子一种「输不起」的观念，于是孩子的失败都只能用来证明父母的正确、树立父母的权威。</p><p>「这是亲情的胁迫。哪怕是以最不动声色的方式。我见过太多像外甥这样的小孩，如果要学体育、艺术，或者什么，家长会是这样的态度：你非要学，我们也不拦着，家里就是再困难，也要供你，但是有一点，你得好好学，给家里争气。既然给了你机会，你又学不好，以后就啥也别说了。家里安排你干什么，你就干什么。」</p><p>「‘输不起’的观念就会从小学，到初中，到高中，一点一点浸透到孩子的少年和整个青春期。越是听话的孩子，越难以承受这种道德和亲情的双重压力。把老老实实按部就班按照家长和老师的安排走下来的人，变成一个充满内疚和负罪感的人。」——当权者剥夺了你自主的信心和对自我的信任，你才会心甘情愿把自己的主导权交给他，让他代替你做判断，因为你相信他比你更清楚，什么对于你来说是好的。</p><p>不容忍犯错是一种极权控制。事实上，人人都在犯错，并通过犯错学习，犯错正是一个人校准方向、去伪存真的途径。当社会的容错率太低，个体的试错成本太高，太多人对「走弯路」唯恐避之不及。结果半生过去，连自己要什么不要什么都不知道，恰恰走入了人生最大的歧路。</p><h2><strong>你真的脱离了体制吗？</strong></h2><p>最近给我最大震撼的是三明治的一篇非虚构故事<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24252514">《后悔从体制内辞职，38 岁的我重新准备考回去》</a></strong>，作者元琪是一个在社区做社工的女性，她由于受不了领导的压榨和无望的发展前景，38 岁时从体制辞职。但在遭遇残酷的社会现实后，她后悔到陷入了抑郁，拼命想再考回体制。</p><p>阅读作者反复的精神自戕，以及对「体制」近乎魔怔的执念，都令人无比窒息。在另一篇<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_21147113">文章</a></strong>里，她曾经清晰记录了自己辞职的来龙去脉——领导的施压已经威胁到了她的身体和心理健康，而这只是压垮她的最后一根稻草。在这之前的十多年里，她早就已经厌倦了这份工作，想要寻求事业上更多可能性。因此，离开体制并不是她头脑发热的决定，而是经过了长期的酝酿。</p><p>然而辞职之后，她偶然得知「社工大幅涨了工资」，加上找工作遇挫，内心陡然失衡。她像是完全忘记了自己之前的感受和渴望，彻底推翻了之前的想法，陷入极端的自责和自我否定中，甚至开始抱怨起父母没有及早制止她。</p><p>「我觉得自己是一个因为不知道游戏规则而提前退场的白痴，我甚至开始恨父母为什么没有在我一开始进入这个单位就告诉我‘进去虽然赚的少，但还会涨，而且能做到退休；可千万不能在快 40 的时候失业，那样就变成 40、50 失业人员了。’他们只是说‘你就在这里待着吧’而已，我哪知道待多久？怎么待？为什么待？」</p><p>这着实令人惊讶，一个 38 岁的人不知道真实的社会是怎样的？且仍然依赖父母来为她的人生负责？但转念一想又无从苛责，毕竟她如此崩溃，也是因为在求职时遭遇的年龄歧视、性别歧视和恶性竞争，这畸形的职场环境对个体的压迫不应被正常化。</p><p>作者坦诚地暴露自己的脆弱，需要莫大的勇气，也得以让更多人洞悉到老中式的宿命悲剧是怎么形成的——关于这个体制以如何的奖惩机制在规训人，以及更重要的，为什么人们完全失去了超越体制的能力。</p><p>这个从「体制」里出走的人，其实没能逃出体制。如果说在体制里的她还保有身心的真实感受、对体制的反思和抵抗它的能动性的话，通过对自己的全盘否定，和对体制发自内心的重新体认，她已被体制毁灭了。</p><p>「我爱老大哥。」——在《1984》的最后，奥威尔早就已经揭示过这种毁灭。</p><p>文章最后，元琪写到：「我还特别质疑‘人生是旷野，不是轨道’这句话，它是社交网络上流行起来的一句话，大概也只适用于利用互联网做自媒体的人们吧？——我这样想。因为血淋淋的残酷现实中没有给人生提供成为旷野的充足的客观条件啊！」</p><p>体制的可怕之处，在于阉割人的自我，剥夺人的能力，使其陷入一种无能状态。可怕的不是离开了它你就没有保障，而是它已潜移默化塑造了你单薄的价值观，狭隘的视野，对人生、对世界极为贫瘠的想象力，并灌输给你超额的贪婪和恐惧。被它规训后的人难以再去为自己掌舵，也只认得出、只会去追求那些他们通过体制所理解的、熟悉的价值。</p><p>在体制内的时候，因为领导的刁难和工作的压力而想放弃，辞职之后被现实当头一棒，又日思夜想体制内的好——一个人并不会因为离开了体制就自动获得成长，她仍然和在体制内时一样，最多懂得怎么趋利避害，却尚未拥有足以掌控自己命运的自由意志。</p><p>当体制的泡泡被打破，遭遇幻灭和创伤是多么正常，但没有能力的人会拼命想回到过去的幻象里，有能力的人则会迅速调整自己的认知去面对现实。相信她很快会意识到，危机的另一面其实是机会，回归真相的机会。抓住这个机会咬牙走下去，说不定也能劫后余生，逐渐开辟出新的道路，不断获得更多新知与能力，最终超越体制。</p><p>人生的价值并不凭空存在于体制外，也不凭空存在于任何地方，它们都需要通过十二万分的努力，甚至赌上高昂的代价，在实践中创造。正如一个读者在元琪的文章后留言：「‘人生是旷野，不是轨道’只适用于那些决心克服千难万难和内心恐惧，把人生变成旷野的人，你觉得是它就是，你去探索它就广阔。」</p><p>我相信社会那么大，总不至于铁板一块，应该到处都有缝隙容留离经叛道之人。尽管在体制外生活的空间会随着环境恶化而越发逼仄，它往往意味着匮乏、清贫、孤独……但对于很多心如明镜的人来说，选择这样的生活是一种道德义务——他们拒绝和体制同流合污。</p><p>最后，我想分享一篇喜欢的<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://m.douban.com/note/822603710/?dt_platform=wechat_friends&amp;dt_dapp=1?bid=JKADXTXHT9Q?bid=gR6F0pJcJcc?bid=gR6F0pJcJcc?bid=VCkvR3pjUYY?bid=GPbkjI9dbug">文章</a></strong>的结尾：「人生就像一场翻山越岭的长途拉力赛，旅途那么长，未知风险那么多，起点高一点低一点，影响的不过是开始的阶段。只要一直跑，到后来会发现那些生来就被赏赐的好处都是浮云，最终还是得靠自己。靠自己的双脚去跑，靠自己的毅力去支撑，还要靠自己强大的心肌去泵动血液。相比那些令人艳羡的资产和社会地位，你的家庭所给予的那些无形的东西更珍贵，比如父母的身传言教，帮你塑造的健全身心，亲情支持，以及从小教会你的独立自强等等……」</p><p>当你走出了自己的路，再回过头去看——离开体制，你确实失去了一些「好处」，但是当你的心智早已成长到了更高的境界，不再认同过去的价值，又为什么会为此难过呢？</p><p></p><p></p><p><br

Working holiday 来了这里，开始学德语。我也不意外，日本护照是全世界最有特权的护照。</p><p>乌克兰人是个数学家，战前就来了哥廷根，在大学研究所工作，她说自己既要学英语，也要学德语。她知道所有名词的前面该用 der，die 还是 das，这天赋让人惊叹。我问她是否是因为乌克兰语的名词词性和德语基本一致。她用口音铿锵婉转的英语告诉我，我们乌克兰语讲起来根本不说这个。那我想这就是数学家善于归类的纯天赋了吧。</p><p>印度人来自孟买，她丈夫来自德里，在德国工作两年了，她们在印度几年前结了婚，现在她来了刚两个月，她不是穆斯林，很世俗，骑个自行车迅即如飞，英语讲得很好。现在她要做的是在德国找一份工作。哥廷根尽管是学术城市，但要找一份研究以外的职业，德语才是更重要的。</p><p>巴基斯坦女人比较有趣，她是穆斯林，Hijab 裹得很紧，第一天上课甚至是丈夫送来的。但她上课很积极，经常抢答，我们练习对话时，她反应也很快。在我们试着说我们所知的从 A 到 Z 的德语词汇时，她知道一切关于超市、食物和日用品的单词。在讲到职业时，她说自己是 Hausfrau，这就难怪了。</p><p>我则多少有些不接地气，讲到职业，磕磕绊绊说出 Schriftsteller 这样的词汇。老师说，你能不能说一些正常的职业。而且你如果是记者和编辑，就不要说自己是作家，作家是写书的。我用德语缓缓回复说，我以前的职业是记者和编辑，现在我就是 Schriftsteller。</p><p>我们都在如幼童般学一门语言，但我们又都在各种场合自学过这门语言了，于是我们都掌握了庞大地图中的小小一隅。而那一隅，多半都关乎我们已经走过的漫长岁月，我的词汇库里是那些老师口里不正常的职业和名词，巴基斯坦女人的词汇库里是超市里所有的蔬菜、肉类、水果和洗衣粉。</p><p>我于是搜出这条两年前的想象自己在语言班的内容。我现在没有丝毫难民感——事实上，这两年我交往了好些曾是难民（如今获得公民权）的朋友，他们都太厉害，太激励我了。</p><p>对了，当我在说她们英语好的时候，并不是说她们有一口伦敦腔/美国腔。我觉得我英语也不错，但是我是一个非英文母语者在使用这门语言。这曾是一门殖民的语言，那既然如今，全世界都在使用它，那它就得有新的后殖民传统。They write you, you write back.</p><p>2018 年时我在香港研究后殖民主义文学，过去两年我在德国、波兰和捷克都必修或旁听了好些后殖民主义英语写作课程，一口正宗 xx 腔，是最不重要的事情，我要做的事，就是 write back。</p><p>现在德语关乎我的生存，虽然很烧脑，但在波兰学了一点波兰语之后，我觉得德语至少看着很亲切。</p><p>我想说做一个移民/难民，一定意味着你是一个乐观主义者——这不是我说的，这是阿伦特说的。你有强大的自信，相信将自己连根拔起后，仍然能在俗世追求一场比你所拥有的，要更幸福的生活。我并非重新开始，而是一切我曾经的自我选择，促成我更多的自我选择。</p><p>我也不用去羡慕这条帖子里的朋友了，因为显然，我相信自己有更深思熟虑的强大生命力。</p><p>2023.4.29</p><p>明天就要去巴尔干了，赴 2019 年说好的约。</p><p>2023.5.13</p><p>最近这几个月很多事情纠缠在一起。</p><p>终于在我国大流行结束后去换了回乡证，整整十年前去到的港村，算是彻底告一段落。</p><p>在德国，忍着极大的尴尬，使用谷歌实时翻译，把完全听不懂的 Erste Hilfe Kurs(first aid course) 上完了，7 个小时，拿到证书，因为这是拿德国驾照的必经之路。</p><p>每天的德语课程。联系柏林的房产中介。做田野，读文献，写论文，完成我的第三个硕士学位（最初我觉得挺丢人的，现在觉得还挺吊的，因为每个学位都彻底改变了我的能力，和命运……）。还有关于出版的那些东西。还有之后在异国的居留权。</p><p>德国白人朋友说我这是 Shenzhen speed，因为他 2019 年和前女友一起去过一趟深圳，爬上了平安大厦顶层，感叹这句 Time is money, efficiency is life 的口号既神奇又疯狂。他让我慢一点，要享受生活。但其实一方面，我觉得自己在这边的移民朋友们，孟加拉人和印尼人，甚至比我更快，更不享受生活，这是没有办法的事情，对我们来说挺住就是一切。</p><p>其次就是我早就习惯了这种挣扎着追寻自由的生活，因为那足够自我，足够「海拉鲁」，足够改写自己的命运。</p><p>2023.5.16</p><blockquote><p>「德国在 1934 年至 1938 年间出版了大量儿时回忆、以家庭为背景的小说、风景图册、大自然抒情作品，以及许多柔情万种的小玩意儿。这是前所未见的现象。除了刻板的纳粹宣传文学之外，德国能够获准发行的书籍几乎完全来自那些范畴。大约从两年前开始，这个趋势就已经不断退潮。其中的原因显然是，因为不管再怎么挖空心思，也越来越无法营造出那种不痛不痒的氛围。</p><p>不过，在此之前的状况只能令人摇头叹息：所有的文学作品都在描绘雪片莲和雏菊花、稚子放长假时的欢乐、初恋时光、童话情景、烤苹果和圣诞树。这种文学充满了赤子之心和缺乏时代背景的色彩，仿佛有约在先一般，在游行队伍、集中营、军火工厂和「冲锋队」募捐铁罐的环绕之下纷纷出炉。</p><p>如果有谁曾经像本书作者一样，于偶然之下必须大量阅读此类书籍的话，便会逐渐发现，它们在乖巧、平静和温柔的敍述背后，正在字里行间不断发出呐喊：「你难道没注意到，我们不受时间影响，回归于内心世界了吗？你难道没注意到，并没有任何事情对我们造成伤害吗？你难道没注意到，我们什么事情都没有注意到吗？请记住这一点，请务必记住这一点，我们向你提出恳求！」</p><p>我认识那些作家当中的某些人。对他们每一个人，或至少大多数人而言，现在已经到了山穷水尽的地步。所发生的许多事件已经令他们无法再视而不见、听而不闻。比方说，他们的亲朋好友已经有人被逮捕，要不然就发生了类似的事件。童年时代的回忆已无法再提供保护伞。不少人因之而崩溃，演出了一幕又一幕的悲剧。将来我会找时间敍述其中的一些故事。</p><p>以上就是德国人在 1933 年夏天所面对的矛盾。那看起来就仿佛是，必须从几种让心灵死亡的不同方式之中作出选择。我们可以说，于正常环境下过惯日子的人，在这里会感觉自己若非进了疯人院，就是待在一所精神病研究所里面。可是又能怎么办呢？事情就是这个样子，而且我无力回天。此外，那个时候还算是比较无害的阶段，接着还会出现完全不一样的情况。</p><p>我想躲在私人领域里面，在一个有遮蔽的小角落安身立命之尝试，很快便一败涂地。其中的原因是：这种地方根本就不存在。狂风暴雨从四面八方侵袭我「私底下」的生活，马上把它吹得四分五裂。比方说，一个可称得上是我「朋友圈子」的小团体，就在 1933 年秋天消失得不知去向。」</p></blockquote><p>——《哈夫纳回忆录：一个德国人的故事》。</p><p>2023.5.25</p><p>Moving to a new country and adapting to it can destroy relationships.</p><p>（这是我的俄罗斯学姐的毕业论文里的一句话。在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后，她决定写这个题目，前苏联移民女性在瑞典如何生存。她写民族志。这一句是她采访的在瑞典的前苏联女性——一个非俄罗斯人用俄语的回忆。最初搬到瑞典来时，她们是夫妻两个人，树年后，她和丈夫离婚了。我的俄罗斯学姐问她为什么，以上是她的回答，从俄语翻译成英语。）</p><p>2023.6.7</p><p>油管最近不知为何开始给我推 432Hz 的纯声音，说会释放潜意识的不良能量。有天夜里我醒来，打开这个声音，似音乐非音乐，然后香甜地接着入睡了。我只记得身处一片云雾之中，有许多人来来去去，我开始不知为何感到委屈，感到悲伤，然后哭了起来，半梦半醒地哭，这场梦中的哭泣，就好像一片叶子，在水里，不知道为什么，荡来荡去。</p><p>2023.6.16</p><p>（我为毕业论文，在柏林做田野期间，顺便去看了一些柏林的老房子，为未来搬过去做打算。）</p><p>在柏林 Neukölln ，带着懂房地产的朋友，看了两套房，算是练练手。看完有点郁闷。她安慰说，第一次看房就买房，就跟和初恋结婚一样不现实。我一下释怀了。</p><p>2023.7.4 大概是十几年前有一帮人做独立校园媒体，毕业前引用了《一代宗师》里那句「念念不忘，必有回响」，觉得很酷，有种善恶终有报的爽感。然后去了香港，至此走上不归路。做的大多数自认为有社会价值有意义的东西，不管是新闻报道、采访研究还是社会抗争，都没有回响，一丝一毫也没有，然后一身折磨，满心创伤，活在惩罚、监控和噩梦之中。</p><p>再在国门完全封闭的两年多前到欧洲，感慨过去十来年，一遍又一遍地重新锻造自己，又时常会想起二十来岁写的看上去意气风发的「人生是一场出埃及记」，但真的出埃及可没有分开红海的壮阔，也不会期待什么回响，习惯在全新的孤独中去打造微小的共同体，一心只想去过那种权力不希望你过的生活。</p><p>上个月 Mubi 推荐的每日电影恰好是《一代宗师》，鬼使神差打开了。关在房间里，拉上窗帘、打开投影，看了一个下午。才想起原来「念念不忘，必有回响」前面还有八个字，那不太起眼、也不太被十几年前的心绪记住的八个字。因为那八个字完全没有目的，不求回报，不期待回响：</p><p>凭一口气，点一盏灯。</p><p>2023.7.30</p><p><strong>告一段落</strong></p><p>欧陆对硕士的学术要求还是很高的。</p><p>回忆起来，我刚到这个德国城市的那半年修了五门课，每门课的 term paper 都需要 15-20 页，不包括 bibliography。波兰和捷克的两个学校要求比哥廷根要低一些，但低不了太多。这次的毕业论文 thesis 是 30000 个单词。</p><p>我第一个硕士在港大新闻系，毕业是写一篇 3000-5000 单词的英文深度报道。第二个硕士在港大文学院读英文研究（文学 track），毕业论文是写一篇 5000 字左右的 capstone project（比较奇怪学院不说这是 thesis）。</p><p>当年读的时候，两个都很吃力，第一个是全职读，第二个是边打工边读。除了当时能力差劲以外，有个巨大的问题就是时间很短，没法充分地浸润其中。比如在新闻系，刚刚适应英文上课，就要开始找冬天的实习。在写毕业报道的时候，还要想着如何留在香港找一份新闻的工作。所有的事情都发生在不到 12 个月里。</p><p>文学系好一些，课程设置非常非常先锋，后殖民主义文学尤其好。但是因为香港高校效仿英国的教育产业，把 MA 和 Mphil 分开，所以 MA 仍然缺少足够的时间去消化那些学到和读到的东西。我当时一边在厂里打工，一边打官司，一边读这个专业，很吃力。所以我把当时的所有资料打印出来，直接带到了德国来，时不时复习一番。</p><p>欧陆这两年的训练和浸润其中，是我体验最好的一次，从理论、方法论到真正做田野、做研究，我都有足够的时间和不同的导师、或不是导师的教授们，不断地交流。</p><p>我自己觉得，一是我的英文能力、各方面的生存能力有了一个质变般地提升，这很大程度上得益于我的第二个硕士，作为一个移民，我提前接受了后殖民教育。</p><p>二是德国的政治经济制度真的离香港那种极端的新自由主义制度比较遥远。在这种地方，小城市尤其更便宜。我不会整天被铺天盖地的金融、财富、房租的压力弄到去被迫学习那些新自由主义技能，比如在地铁口和证券经纪人去开证券户口这种很傻缺、但又很香港的真实故事。</p><p>我现在找到了我为何要读三个硕士的理由：</p><p>第一个是因为我不想在国内做新闻记者。</p><p>第二个是因为想为润提前做语言和思想的准备。</p><p>第三个是因为要执行离开，当然离开只是手段，我是为了恢复公共写作。</p><p>现在执行完了。读不读博士，也许现在多了一点点信心，但是有什么研究课题，得花五年时间去做的？得再想想。</p><p>生存和身份永远是第一要义。简单说，交税是第一要义，有德国学位+两年交税，可以申请永居。</p><p>其次，即便是在德国，你还是生活在新自由主义的大环境中的移民。</p><p>前些天数了一下过去十年做的五份工作。两份记者编辑 YZZK。DUAN。都在香港，自由媒体。一份风投机构 FENGRUIZIBEN。一份学术机构 GANGDAZHENGZHIXUEXI。一个厂工 GUANGDONGOUBOKEJI。我没任何成为领导的职业规划，唯一的规划就是要自由地活。记者不让做了，可以去为挣钱而吃屎一段时间。这都是计划的一部分。</p><p>生活很简单，明确目标，面对无处不在的突发情况，保持淡定，一步步执行，一步步润。不和权力媾和与妥协。</p><p>2023.7.31 电影《晨光正好》★★★★☆</p><p>"I have forgotten how."真像我的异国生活。我突然意识到，移民生活至少在某些时空下，也是一种丧偶体验。</p><p>2023.08.04</p><p>成为散居者/离散者/移民，成为一个国家的少数族裔，成为第一代移民，是否还使用母语写作，如何使用第二或三门语言，如何准备好所有的资料去外国人办公室，如何让银行卡里有官员们认可的金额，什么情况可以办公立医疗保险，什么情况可以申请何种居留，你在何种程度介入母国政治和文化生活，你要如何努力不让自己在接收国社会彻底缺席，你应该如何进行跨国的公共参与，你要如何面对一个自由民主体制的系统性不公，这些都是实实在在需要第一代移民去面对、行动甚至抗争的……</p><p>如果我做移民生意，我会首先教中产白领多读读后殖民主义。后殖民主义在国内语境下，老被我国新左派奇形种们，拿来证明对抗西方的重要性，这当然是一种脱离语境的逆练。</p><p>但如果你是一个中国的自由右派中产阶级，如果对后殖民毫无了解，在移民后很容易陷入失语，因为作为移民你一定会遭遇一种系统性的歧视性环境，尤其拿着一本我国护照的时候。但你此刻陷入一种极端的交叉性之中，面对很多问题，脱离语境，你往往不知道怎么描述自己的痛苦。一个简单的问题是，一个自由民主社会怎么还会有这么多让我不舒服的地方呢？我批评它难道不是跟小粉红一样了吗？一定是我自己的问题吧。</p><p>不是的，是这个自由民主社会的问题。</p><p>2023.08.28 电影《过往人生》★★★★☆</p><p>移民的类型真多啊。而我呢？二十二岁时以为到香港，就到此为止。三十岁又来一次。在大流行大封锁期间。诀别爱人，不断地诀别爱人。不是同样的人生境遇，没有一起出走，被打断的团聚，渴望，恨，痛，无可奈何，任它去罢。走到的竟然还不是英语国家。牙牙学语。我的梦里不是中文，我的梦没有声音。对她说理解她的选择。对她说我没有回头路。那等待我的命运是什么呢？Nora 想拿的那些奖，我不想，我只好奇我能活到哪一岁。</p><p>2023.09.05</p><p>在德国的工作快有眉目了，不过话别说太死，任何事情都可能发生变故。看看去努力做连接者，会是什么样。我很珍惜这个机会，因为真的能帮到人。不坐班，但得住柏林。有时间写我那本拖欠的稿，有时间上德语课，有时间自我寻找较长时间的项目，一个个默默做下去，找到一种可以不损害个人福祉、有未来可持续、而不是为爱发电、充满日常威胁的生活和贡献方式。这是我十年前，刚做港媒记者时，梦寐以求的一种生活模式。</p><p>过去十年，我在香港或深圳或北京，始终找不到这样的模式。我很早就成为一个国家的边缘人。但过去十年的五份工作和三个硕士，给了我一身新自由主义跨国技能，这是特权。我想许多人身上都有自己各自的 Privilege 和 Marginality，重要的是认识和理解到这些，知道自己的身体处于社会结构的哪个位置，然后去做一点有益的事情。当然，不要让自己过得太辛苦，这同样是过去十年的经历教给我的。你得理解，无论在哪里，你仍然活在一个新自由主义的世界。</p><p>自然少不了那无穷无尽的歧视性的许可文件之路。这条路我曾走过一次，走了七年。移民的世界充满了如下词汇：技能、语言、入境处、墙、种族、性别、阶级、外国人管理局、劳动部、国籍法…这些词汇把你<strong>锻造成流亡高手、官方信件收发室、自我观察大师、努力支楞职业演员、被迫多语言使用者。</strong>（粗体字抄袭了 Dubravka Ugresic 的小说《平衡的艺术》，出自《狐狸》一书）</p><p>2023.09.14</p><p>今年二月，时隔两年回国，要办因为封锁而拖了好几年的回乡证，去老家县派出所注销户口。那段时间死人比较多，家对面的县人民医院每天都死几十个人。很多年轻人来派出所帮家里其他亡故亲人注销户口。</p><p>我没多想，径直问派出所裹着很厚深蓝色棉袄的大姐：我来注销我的户口。</p><p>大姐看着我直勾勾地说：你的死亡证明在哪里？</p><p>她说完我们互相盯着对方，竟然有几秒钟，她没觉得尴尬，我没觉得冒犯。我们只是沉默看着对方。此后我反复想起那个沉默的悲伤情景，我不知道她是不是失去了谁，但她看向我如看穿一个莫名其妙的鬼魂。</p><p>她在那一刻只是个照章办事的小吏吗，还是她一瞬间妄想了和鬼魂说话的可能吗？</p><p>2023.09.18</p><p>关于这天与去年，我记得许多许多的痛。</p><p>2023.10.11</p><p>夏天结束，人生悲伤事情真多。</p><p>2023.10.20</p><p>重新过上坐公共交通上下班的日子。但纯粹就是坐地铁，谈不上挤地铁。给外管局发去了我的工作合同。吃午饭时把她送的手套忘了，现在去找。再独自去看《花月杀手》，迟到了二十分钟，结果还在放广告。</p><p>2023.10.23</p><p>今天去柏林出差，顺便又看了一次房子，再次失望了。</p><p>位置特别好，Kreuzbergstraße，房子装修得特别好，暖气非常现代化，电表是全新的，马桶不是坐地的而是入墙的，看这些是上次看房学到的经验，朝向虽然朝北但这不算啥了。之所以降价 20%，是因为之前楼上属于一个房屋建造公司，疫情前在加盖一层，然后疫情期间，房屋建造公司倒闭了，于是外立面和院子里的脚手架，就这么一直绑在外面。</p><p>整栋楼院就这么像木乃伊一样被绑了一年多了，新来的物业管理公司联系不到原来的房屋公司负责人，也不知道何时脚手架会解除。</p><p>对了，这栋公寓楼的建成日期是 1900 年。建造日期早不一定差，因为那时候建造的房子墙体厚，用料扎实，隔音好，保暖好。比起 1945 年以后那几年修的房子反而更好。我住过 1955 年建造的房子，隔音等于没有。</p><p>但是 1900 这个年份还是让我太惊讶了，那是欧洲的大国协同的长和平时代，是两次大战以前的长 19 世纪，是民族独立蠢蠢欲动的时代，是帝国殖民的晚期，是黑暗之心出版的第二年，是第二帝国，是晚清！我竟然在看一个这样的房子，这里面有多少孤魂野鬼住过？</p><p>回我的小城时，德铁又「准时地」取消+alternative 的班次也「准时地」延误了。</p><p>2023.10.30</p><p>读 Ocean Vuong 的新小说，On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous.</p><p>这让我想起一个 1.5 代华人移民 ABC 朋友，她一直在主流外媒工作。我和邓飞打官司时，她曾采访我。前段时间在瑞典的一个新闻 Fellowship 上，我们重逢了，聊了很多文学类的话题，不再是采访者和受访者的关系。她离开美国后，一直在亚洲各种地方生活，印度、中国、泰国等等。我们有一个非常相反的人生轨迹，连读书都是。我是先读 Rushdie，进入英文系后再读 Jhumpa Lahiri。她则是相反。我喜欢她邮件发给我的一个她所写的短篇随笔。</p><p>我能理解到她使用英文为母语的优美和伤感，就好像看的这本书一样。这本美好的伤感的书。我们在这片大地上，曾短暂地绚烂过。</p><p>（结束。我没想到把所有这些很短的段落结合起来，竟然会有九千多个字。）</p><hr><blockquote><p>如果你读到这里，不妨下方链接，输入邮箱，即可订阅「Diasporic

                <![CDATA[<p>在广州东北三百多里的深山中，藏着大宋朝的国家宝藏。</p><p>对大多数宋人来说，这是蛮荒莽林，但对王安石而言，却是自幼熟悉之地。十岁那年，他父亲来此做官，他也跟着待了三年，到老仍念念不忘。</p><p>这里藏着很多野生铜矿。夜间路过的话，常常能发现山间高耸的岩壁上散射出金碧的光芒，地上也时不时能捡到掺杂着青色金属的石块。由于很多人来这里偷偷挖矿冶炼，附近常常发生火灾，境内的月华寺百年内烧毁了三次。</p><p>此地名为韶州，来这淘金的人，到北宋中期已经不下十万。公元 1050 年，朝廷终于下令在这里建设专门的铸币机构「永通监」，大规模铸造铜钱。这里的铜产量，巅峰的时候超过全国的 95%。</p><p>原本北宋一年岁铸的铜钱量基本在 100 万贯上下，但自从永通监设立之后，这个数值一路上涨，到王安石变法期间，仅该监一年就能铸造铜钱 160 万贯。</p><p>在上篇《卖炭翁》的故事里曾经提到，唐帝国一辈子也没跳出通货紧缩，问题直到宋代才解决。</p><p>确实，宋代铸造出了足够多的铜钱。但新的问题又出现了。</p><hr><p>永通监设立的那一年，王安石三十岁，已经拥有了不小的名气。他二十一岁中进士，按照老朋友曾巩的说法，「自重，不愿知于人」，很爱惜自己的羽毛，不愿自我吹嘘。即使有机会申请既有前途又清闲的官位，他也并不在意，一心要去地方上实践自己的理念。</p><p>他越是不求名利，越是被大家看重。政敌兼朋友司马光也不得不承认，安石「独负天下大名三十余年」，天下人都认为他只要去中枢做官，太平盛世就将来到。</p><p>历史书上通常讲王安石的变法，终极目的是富国强兵，但这其实是大大的误会，实在把他看得小了。</p><p>他在三十八岁时给仁宗皇帝写了一份《万言书》，讲他自己的改革主张。全篇基本没提到强兵，提理财的也很少，按篇幅算只有 2.5%。剩下的部分全部是在讲求「先王之政」。</p><p>在王安石看来，宋代的内忧外患，根子上是由于不行先王之政。而之所以如此，症结在于没有通晓先王之意的人才。所以为政之道，首先是要教育这样的人才，培养他们的品德，然后把其中优秀的人选出来加以任用。</p><p>用现在的观点看，王安石其实是想推行一套全新的国家意识形态。</p><p>汉唐的儒生讲究「寻章摘句」，注重钻研字词的含义、礼法的细节。但是王安石认为这个方向完全错了。完全的复古没有前途，真正的改革要追寻先王的政治精神，而非沉迷于文字的细节。</p><p>要追寻先王的政治精神，就得先讲明白这个精神是什么。王安石写了很多书来讲这个，其中保留最完整、也最有代表性的，是一篇《洪范传》。</p><p>《洪范》是儒家经典《尚书》中的一篇，字面意思是「大法」。这篇文章里讲了九种治国的根本大法，也即儒生们津津乐道的「洪范九畴」。王安石对这九种大法的解释有详有略，其中展开最详的是第五种大法——「皇极」——也就是君王之道，相关内容占据了全文四分之一的篇幅。</p><p>尽管身为臣子，但王安石对于应该怎么做皇帝却很有一套自己的见解。比如他认为皇帝不能从众：</p><blockquote><p>「苟曰好德，则虽茕独，必进宠之而不虐；苟曰不好德，则虽高明，必罪废之而不畏也。……虐茕独而宽朋党之多，畏高明而忽卑晦之贱，最人君之大戒也。」（翻译见注释，下同）</p></blockquote><p>皇帝也不能只喊口号，而得让老百姓先富起来，然后再教化他们：</p><blockquote><p>「凡正人之道，既富之然后善。……为政于天下者，在乎富之、善之。……徒教化不能使人善。」</p></blockquote><p>他甚至认为，皇帝的合法性并不是绝对的：</p><blockquote><p>「君能顺天而效之，则民亦顺君而效之也。……及至后世，矫诬上天以布命于下，而欲人之弗叛也，不亦难乎？」</p></blockquote><p>王安石在这里提及了「天」（天道），而这完全违背了儒家的传统。在儒学初创的时代，「夫子之言性与天道，不可得而闻」，人与世界的本质这类话题，孔子是绝口不提的。</p><p>而王安石不仅要提，而且提得很激进。他认为人不仅可以认识天道，而且可以主导天道。只要志意精诚，就能「道万物而无所由，命万物而无所听」（超脱规律去引导万物、超脱命运而安排万物）。</p><p>「Yes，We Can.」是很有蛊惑力的。对于经济发达、书籍和知识前所未有普及的北宋来说，王安石的高远理想比之前的任何学说都更能吸引人。陆游的爷爷陆佃曾经回顾早年邂逅王安石学说的情景：</p><blockquote><p>「淮之南，学士大夫宗安定先生之学，予独疑焉。及得荆公《淮南杂说》与其《洪范传》，心独谓然。于是愿扫临川先生之门。」</p></blockquote><p>王安石根本不用现身说法，只靠区区两篇文章，就让他彻底折服。</p><p>这种自信心的集体膨胀，在历史上常常出现。只要经济社会一旦有相当持续、快速的发展，大众传媒又加以推波助澜，结果就很难避免。19 世纪的欧洲、11 世纪的北宋，都是如此。人们会想当然地认为自己既然已经主宰了那么多，那就能主宰更多，甚至主宰一切。</p><p>就如 19 世纪的进步主义最后会遭遇两次世界大战，11 世纪的北宋新儒学也将撞上历史的南墙。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/5b3e168d-9381-4314-ab52-cb8e2ffcc51b.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>故宫南薰殿旧藏《历代圣贤名人像册》之王安石像</figcaption></figure><hr><h2><strong>注释</strong></h2><pre><code>1 据《广东通志》卷 39《名宦志》，王安石的父亲王益天圣八年（1030）任知韶州。见蔡上翔《王荆公年谱考略》。另参王安石在变法之后所作《答韶州张殿丞书》（《王文公文集》卷 8。同一作者的集子，除首次出现注明全名外，以下简称《文集》）。</code></pre><pre><code>2 苏轼《月华寺（寺邻岑水场，施者皆坑户也，百年间盖）》（《苏轼诗集》卷 38）说「高岩夜吐金碧气，晓得异石青斓斑」，又说「月华三火岂天意」，即指此。岑水场乃韶州最大的矿场。</code></pre><pre><code>3 余靖《韶州新置永通监记》，「韶被山带海，杂产五金，四方之人，弃农亩、持兵器，慕利而至者不下十万。」该文作于皇祐二年（1050 年），永通监当年新建，此年王安石三十岁。参张建《余靖&lt;韶州新置永通监记&gt;考略》。</code></pre><pre><code>4 参徐东升《宋代铜产量变动原因析论》。</code></pre><pre><code>5 《宋史·食货下二》：「韶……永通……监，旧额八十万，至（熙宁）七年（1074），增三十万，及折二凡五十万。」</code></pre><pre><code>6 曾巩与王安石同列「唐宋八大家」，说见其《再与欧阳舍人书》（《元丰类稿》卷 15）。</code></pre><pre><code>7 《宋史·王安石传》：「擢进士上第，签书淮南判官。旧制，秩满许献文求试馆职，安石独否。再调知鄞县。」馆职系宋代官职体系中一特殊存在，文官加馆职，则升迁较速，而且职位清闲且光荣。</code></pre><pre><code>8 司马光《与王介甫第一书》（《温国文正司马公文集》卷 60）：「介甫独负天下大名三十余年，才髙而学富，难进而易退，远近之士，识与不识，咸谓介甫不起而已，起则太平可立致。」司马光写此文时在熙宁三年（1070），由此倒推，在 1040 前后，二十岁的王安石名声已显，到 1050 年时，更已有相当名望。</code></pre><pre><code>9 全名《上仁宗皇帝言事书》，又名《上皇帝万言书》（《文集》卷 1）。</code></pre><pre><code>10 所谓「因天下之力，以生天下之财，取天下之财，以供天下之费。」即出此文。</code></pre><pre><code>11 同上，「今之失，患在不法先王之政者，以谓当法其意而已。夫二帝、三王，相去盖千有余载，一治一乱，其盛衰之时具矣。其所遭之变，所遇之势，亦各不同，其施设之方亦皆殊，而其为天下国家之意，本末先后，未尝不同也。臣故曰：当法其意而已。法其意，则吾所改易更革，不至乎倾骇天下之耳目，嚣天下之口，而固已合乎先王之政矣。」</code></pre><pre><code>12 即《文集》之第 25 卷。</code></pre><pre><code>13 翻译：「如果有人说自己要遵循美德，那就算他是孤零零的少数派，皇帝也要表彰鼓励他、不能欺负他；如果有人说自己不遵循美德，那就算他地位高、口碑好，皇帝也必须惩罚他、不能惧怕。欺负少数派而纵容多数人形成朋党，惧怕地位高、口碑好的人，就忽略他们做的坏事，那是做皇帝最需要警惕的事。」</code></pre><pre><code>14 翻译：「要让人走正道，要先让他们富裕，再让他们善良。……执政就是要让老百姓富有、善良。……单单靠教化，没法让人向善。」</code></pre><pre><code>15 翻译：「皇帝能遵循天道、尽力做到，那老百姓就能遵从君王的旨意，也尽力去做。……后世君主有些人假称自己是天命所归，却想大家不背叛，那不是很难吗？」</code></pre><pre><code>16 《论语·公冶长》。</code></pre><pre><code>17 这是 2008 年奥巴马竞选美国总统的口号，他借此战胜原本占优势的党内竞争者希拉里，并最终当选总统。</code></pre><pre><code>18 翻译：「淮河以南，读书人和官员都推崇胡瑗的学说，我却偏偏有所怀疑。等读到王安石《淮南杂说》和《洪范传》，心里觉得特别有道理，于是愿意拜王先生为师。」出自陆佃《傅（明孺）府君墓志》（《陶山集》卷 15）。这里所说的安定先生即胡瑗，北宋前期著名学者。胡瑗的著作流传较少，据《宋史》本传，他的学问讲求礼法为多，对义理的独到发挥较少。这里所说的王安石《淮南杂说》今也不存，只有少数佚文存世。参金生杨《论王安石&lt;淮南杂说&gt;中的「异志」 思想》。王安石临川人，临川即指他。</code></pre>

年代的成长充满路障，虽然所在的戏剧界充满了革命和实验的欣欣向荣，却依然以健全的身体作为准入标准。回顾这一段过往，李维斯分析了不同残障女性如何在剧团中学会放下污名，尊重和欣赏每个人独特的身体特质，并形成拥抱各自脆弱的集体网络。值得骄傲的不是残障者翻身变为超人，而是如李维斯借另一位残障舞者谢丽尔·玛丽·韦德所说：「你可以既强大又破碎。你可以在坚强的同时有着非比寻常的伤痛和苦楚。」在本文末尾，同为剧场工作者的孙悦星，也提供了她翻译本文的心路历程。</p><p>–</p><p>在残障骄傲月，愿不同时空中的余秀华和李维斯们能够照亮对方，去舞蹈，去写诗，去摇摇晃晃地爱，去欢庆自己海星一般的手、月亮一般的足、伊诗比蒂玫瑰一样绽放的耳朵。</p></blockquote><p>原文作者&nbsp;/&nbsp;维多利亚·李维斯（Victoria

50 年代初，以主流舞台对于身体多样性的排斥为导火索，美国剧场届掀起了一场「民主化思潮」：一次对于谁能够登上舞台、谁的故事得以被讲述的重新建构【1】。这场思潮尤为明显的一个表现是，在 20 世纪 60、70 年代，原本分布在混合性别、非传统团体中的女性逐渐走向了以女性为主的集体剧团【2】。本文追溯与之相关的行动：美国西海岸三个由残障女性组成的戏剧团体的由来：「别的声音（Other Voices）」（洛杉矶，1982）；「搞怪瘸子帮 （Wry Crips）」（伯克利，1985）；以及 AXIS 舞团（奥克兰，1987）。</p><p>萌芽于共同的被贬低身份，民主化思潮的第一步往往涉及通过集体创作来建立新的形象表述。如「魔女（Lilith）」女性剧团（译者注，Lilith，希伯来语为לִּילִית，最早出现于苏美尔神话，亦同时记载于犹太教的拉比文学。在这些文学中，她被指为亚当的第一个妻子，由上帝用泥土所造。因不愿雌伏在亚当身下而离开伊甸园。她也被记载为萨麦尔的情人、夜之魔女，也是法力高强的女巫。）的早期成员卡罗琳·梅尔（Carolyn Myers）所说，（她们的）任务是去找到一个不一样的故事，一个与主流文化信息「女性天生是次等人，强大的女性注定要被排斥」相左的故事：</p><blockquote><p>我们（女性）都曾被欺骗着……我们被排除在重要事务圈层外。……我们必须学会相信我们自己，相信彼此……以及去倾听别人讲述她们生命中所真实发生的故事以及那些醒悟的瞬间。【3】</p></blockquote><figure

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>「魔女」女性舞团海报，图源：liliththeater.com</figcaption></figure><p>在发觉自己残障女性身份的过程中，佩妮·豪尔（Peni Hall）、佩迪·奥芙兰朵（Patty Overland）、朱迪·史密斯（Judy Smith）、谢丽尔·玛丽·韦德（Cheryl Marie Wade）以及我自己在内的残障艺术家们从女性主义剧场实践中找到了榜样。我们也都曾有过顿悟的瞬间，意识到我们的身份一度被「谎言所塑造」：消极的形象表述深深根植于公共政策与机构当中。我们分享自己的经历，努力突破旧有的刻板印象，并对残障重新进行想象。</p><p>许多残障研究学者主张，残障研究衍生于女性主义学说。罗斯玛丽·格兰德-汤普森（Rosemarie Garland-Thomson）在她的开创性著作《不寻常的身体：美国文化及文学中对身体残障的刻画》（1997）中建立了两者的关联，她坚称「女性特质与残障在父权文化中被紧密纠缠在一起。」【4】。从亚里士多德将女性定义为一个「畸形」或「残缺」的男性开始，格兰德-汤普森追溯了在西方文化中女性与残障是如何持续不断交织在一起的——「常人」仅指于肢体健全的男性，甚至在一段时间内仅指白人。16 年后，在振聋发聩的论著《女性主义，酷儿，瘸子》中，艾莉森·卡福尔（Alison Kafer）强调「女性主义学说给了我理论工具，让我批判性地思考残障、对身体多样性的污名化，以及关于反抗、异议及集体行动的多种模式及策略。」【5】</p><figure class="image"><img

Roth）所定义的「与女性的个人经历、女性的集体过往以及探索特定女权社会活动策略相关的」【6】女性主义剧场实践十分相似。尽管如此，一个自成一体、专属于残障女性的实践还是应运而生了。原因何在？</p><p>在寻找答案的过程中，我希望将残障置于美国剧场界民主化思潮的框架下，并消解「残障」在文化范畴中被归为消极及无可救药的「他者」的表述。同时，当针对残障的不平等社会结构被暴露出来，我们就能更清楚看见残障经历中的独特性。这些经历中的很多元素是当下对于平等和普世人权的定义所无法囊括的。游走于社会建构和本质差异的两极之间，我意在对根植于剧场集体实践中的「平等」「平权」概念发出质问，扩充其栖于广大剧场界的定义。</p><h2><strong>01. 为何自成一体？</strong></h2><p>在 1977 年残障权利被立法保护之前，残障人士从未受到过文化界守门人的认可。20 世纪 70 年代前，把残障划归为消极范畴的陈旧观念，与文化参与、教育培训及就职途径的缺失一起，肉眼可见地将残障者在美国文化生活中的存在剔除了【7】。本文所讨论三个剧团的创始及早期成员中，只有三位有过训练背景：佩妮·豪尔（「搞怪瘸子帮」），邦妮·莱沃茨（AXIS 舞团），以及我自己（「别的声音」）。莱沃茨和豪尔在身体损伤之前都接受过正统的戏剧及舞蹈训练。我被专业培训拒之门外，但在两家剧团任职的过程中接触到了非传统实践和女性主义实践。<strong>在残障剧团的大多数女性甚至都未曾获得在表演艺术领域的准入资格。但她们都曾受到民主化思潮的感染并直觉性地运用表演艺术的潜力为残障在文化范畴中正名。</strong></p><p>舞台上下，自由主义与保守主义者都在借用残障比喻来为自己的议题增加声量。保守修辞看似最为普遍：一位意志坚定、与残疾搏斗战胜重重磨难的独立女性，成为了引导个人主义的典范。然而左翼的文化建制似乎与右翼一样，受困于主流的错误观点中。因此，一大批战争及资本主义下可怜的残疾的受害者形象，以及如评论家尤那·乔杜里有力指出为「伪悲剧」的慷慨自戕（heroic suicide）（译校注：指美国现当代文化作品中经常体现的「如果残疾，则宁愿去死」的故事情节）【8】，纷纷出现在如布莱恩·克拉克的《究竟是谁的人生？》和保罗·海金斯的《百万美元宝贝》【9】等的戏剧和电影中。自 20 世纪 70 年代中叶以来，残障活动家、学者及艺术家拒绝了残障的「医疗模型」——残障人士是患病且无法自理的，或是被有效「治愈」的英雄式的身残志坚者。如今，残障活动家和艺术家将残障置于一个社会建构的、历史定义下的体系中来讲述：即「社会模型」，一个能够提供个人及政治洞察视角，使集体行动成为可能的范式。</p><figure class="image"><img

60 年代为开端讲述残障女性实践如何从女性主义剧场浮现出来，西方剧场的民主化思潮其实可追溯到革命时期的法国——就在这一时期，对于贵族阶级的革命性表述首次出现：「天性柔弱似女子，生来又瘸又瞎」【10】。<strong>这样的比喻影响了之后两个世纪众多激进的剧场实践，将男子气概和自理能力视为优越。</strong>残障史学家道格拉斯·贝恩顿（Douglas Baynton）探索了残障隐喻如何贯穿于 19 世纪及 20 世纪早期关于公民资格的大辩论，如女性投票权，非裔美国人的自由及公民权利，以及对于移民的限制等议题【11】。正如贝恩顿所发现的，在将这三类人视为「残障」、将解放视为进一步致残中，歧视被理所当然地正当化了。医生们一度坚称，「屈服于强者的需求深植于非裔美国人体内」：证据就存在于其「跪拜仪式」（genu flexit）当中，非裔美国人的膝盖天生易于跪拜【12】。至于解放，则带给了非裔美国人「一场心理和生理上的显著衰退。」 【13】与此相似，这批医生还曾强调，女性受教育会导致生育器官「萎缩、变形、变弱以及生病。」【14】来自南欧和东欧的移民则被判断为软弱且有缺陷，有玷污英裔美国人基因池的威胁。【15】由此，毫不惊讶，被剥夺公民权利的、力图争取平权的群体，曾经试图将自己与「瘸子、残疾、瞎子」拉开尽可能大的距离。摆脱被污名化笼罩的残障，坚决强调自身的男子气概、独立及完好，为这些被剥削者提供过跻身一等公民的门票。</p><h2><strong>02. 悬置的污名管理: 「安全水域」</strong></h2><p>1982 年，当我创建「别的声音」（1982-2002）这个专属于残障女性的工作坊项目时，我还是一名「魔女」剧团的成员（1978-1981）。我借用了「魔女」所使用的肢体剧场练习和「个人的就是政治的」故事讲述方法。残障女性真实经历的故事因其特殊性、惊人的反转及共鸣，使其在马可提泼剧院的排练室之外亦引发反响，并最终在 1984 年形成了一档特别电视节目——「告诉他们我是人鱼」，由自由派拥护者诺曼·李尔出品，社会活动家/艺术家简·方达主持。</p><figure class="image"><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>电视节目「告诉他们我是人鱼」（1984）截图。图源：https://archive.org/details/tellthemimamermaid</figcaption></figure><p>在这样的成功背后，是集体创作为新敍事奠定了基础。芭芭拉·维斯曼将她打破身体局限性的能力归功于共享污名：「移动胳膊和双手对我来说总归是很冒险的。我太显眼了。（在工作坊的）其他每个人亦是如此。」【16】在这个团体中的肢体自由，以及随之而来的扣人心弦的故事，都来自于「污名管理」（stigma management）的悬置，「污名管理」由社会学家欧文·戈夫曼在《污名：受损身份管理札记》（1963）中提出。对于残障人士而言，「污名管理」描述了为显得「正常」而采取的社交手段。如评论家格兰德-汤普森所解释的，这种「涂脸秀」（minstrelsy），对「正常」的表演，就是被主流社会接受所要付出的代价。</p><figure class="image"><img

noreferrer nofollow" href="http://amazon.com/">amazon.com</a></p><p>当烧伤幸存者芭芭拉·卡马拉将工作坊描述为一个「柔软且安全的空间」，创造了「充分自由的场域去发挥，且充满意义」时【17】，她也在部分描述着悬置污名管理所带来的效果。同样的敍述也出现在「搞怪瘸子帮」的集体排练中，诗人/剧作家谢丽尔·玛丽·韦德如是说：「这是一片安全的水域，当你试图理解你感受到的到底是什么、甚至去尝试着去表达残障的经历时，你可以安全地漂浮其上」。佩妮·豪尔将「搞怪瘸子帮」的集体创作过程描述为：「一个塞子被拔掉了，接着你就可以去说更多，感受更多」。她同时补充道，「对于许多女性来说，当房间里有男性存在时，安全感会消失」。【18】与同时期的其他进步运动一样，残障人权运动也存在着男性主导和性别歧视的问题。</p><p>「柔软」与「安全」并不是能够与 20 世纪六七十年代非传统戏剧所联系在一起的特质。激进的非传统剧团继承了对「人民」一词的社会主义诠释，强调有男子气概和个人临危不惧的勇气。艾瑞克·霍布斯鲍姆（Eric Hobsbawm）提到，在社会主义运动当中人民肖像逐渐「男性化」，从十九世纪早期裸露上身的《自由引导人民》变为有着强健肌肉的男性形象。【19】在 20 世纪二三十年代的德国，众多知名的社会主义工人合唱队同意女性加入传统的混合团，却将她们从革命歌曲的演唱中排除在外；女性的声音在当时被认为过高过细，不适合表达激进的情绪。【20】</p><figure class="image"><img

世纪欧仁·德拉克罗瓦《自由引导人民》原画。图源：wikipedia</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>03. 独立/相互依存/依赖：那些故事</strong></h2><p>「独立」（independence），「相互依存」（interdependence）和「依赖」（dependence）这三个词语在残障权利运动的发展中扮演了极其重要的角色，正如该运动也在法律和民间讨论中都与「自立生活运动」紧密相连。社会活动的先驱者们意识到被视为依赖者的风险，便将「独立」一词重新主张为非自理（autonomy）而是自立（agency），并以此来反叛医疗系统高高在上的控制和缺乏无障碍设施的社会环境对残障者的孤立。</p><p>独立并非是自理而是自立的观念在「别的声音」工作坊里产生的故事中体现得十分明显。不同于大众媒体所描绘的奇迹般的治愈场景「我能再次行走！」，许多上肢力量受限的女性会将把手动轮椅换成电动的视为解放。现在，她们可以依照自己的意志行动了。<strong>在这个群体中，轮椅非但不是依赖，反而是独立的象征。</strong></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9f40f97e-514a-4a3c-b1cf-6280d39e4b20.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>「别的声音」舞团工作坊，1982。图源：原文</figcaption></figure><p>残障艺术家坚持认为，诸如此类的故事只会来自于残障经历中。女演员伊塔莉亚·迪托的故事正是如此。迪托在两岁时于厄瓜多尔与小儿麻痹症「结缘」。当她们举家搬迁至美国后，伊塔莉亚被放入一家医院里，从两岁住到十二岁。据迪托所述，她不会讲英语的父母「不停地签署手术同意书，却并不知道在我身上会发生什么。」迪托八岁时，她开始说英语并且</p><blockquote><p>「开始问许多关于自己手术的问题。我亲眼所见，医生们根本不知道自己在做什么。他们只不过是在我身上练习新的外科手术而已。是的，我想走路，想变成一个‘正常’人。「……」当我从「……最后」一台手术中苏醒过来时，我爸爸站在我身边，我对他说，‘爸爸，不要再做手术了，拜托了。我不能走路没关系。我只想在这些医院围墙之外过生活，我会尽我所能让它变成最好的人生。’」【22】</p></blockquote><p>迪托的故事很新。治愈与战胜——残障故事中标准的戏剧高潮，在这里变成了危险的源头。这个女英雄，一个十二岁的小姑娘，看到了她周围所有人都看不到的：即独立是关于自立而不是自理；即种族歧视和阶级偏见可以隐身在先进医疗科学的假面之后。</p><p>研究福利国家的历史学者黛博拉·斯通观察到，「两个世纪以来对于无坚不摧的个人主义的造神，不会轻易向‘依赖是人类生存所需’这一疼痛的事实低头。」【23】可以说，<strong>残障剧作，使「我们文化中过度强调独立」【24】的现象得以显形。</strong>近年来，残障学者和社会活动家从「独立」逐步转向「相互依存」，用以更加准确地描述出包括残障人士在内全体人类的生活经历、以及过度强调基于自理和个体力量的平等观如何对集体福祉造成了危险。</p><h2><strong>04. 「搞怪瘸子帮」剧团：身体与性</strong></h2><p>（1958 年女子四重唱组合 the Cordettes 歌曲《棒棒糖》的曲调）</p><blockquote><p>身体部位，身体部位</p><p>哦吼，身体、身体部位（X2）</p><p>我有海星一样的手/我有月亮一样的足</p><p>我有像伊诗比蒂玫瑰一样绽放的耳朵</p></blockquote><p>谢丽尔·玛丽·韦德对于流行歌曲《棒棒糖》充满欢乐的戏仿表演诞生于她在「搞怪瘸子帮」残障女性剧团中的成长。韦德，这个在 20 世纪八九十年代残障文化中的「时髦女郎」，曾因独角戏《野蛮女孩》获颁美国国家艺术基金（NEA）独立艺术家奖金，在进入剧团时却显得信心不足——她说：「无论我当时多么激进，我一度都没办法与自己的身体和解。」参加「搞怪瘸子帮」是韦德成长为一名表演者和写作者的转折点：</p><blockquote><p>（搞怪瘸子帮）最妙的地方在于，能够在这里作为一个残疾女性畅所欲言。……我从没想过要针对自己的身份表达什么，直到加入剧团。……我在搞怪瘸子帮找到了自己的声音。【26】</p></blockquote><figure

年来到奥克兰，在轮椅运动中相遇。奥芙兰将剧团的创立归功于一次浪漫邂逅。「我当时正和一个来自‘母语’（女性主义剧团）的演员约会」，她回忆说，「我只想着她去哪我就去哪。」之后，女友带她去看「胖嘴唇」剧团（反对肥胖压迫）的一场演出，奥芙兰创立「搞怪瘸子帮」的主意就在那时诞生了。【27】</p><p>如同前辈「母语」剧团一样，「搞怪瘸子帮」也反对所有的等级制度。那时没有面试，没有导演/编剧/演员的区别称呼【28】。如果你想表演，那你就算加入了。她们拥抱所有类型的残障及经历，并坚信在一个残障女性团体中发现个人真相的力量。【29】剧团里的所有人都在创作——诗歌、独白、短剧，同时所有人都表演。佩妮·豪尔曾在早年间担任剧团内戏剧构作和行政管理工作，她描述选角和修改剧本的过程会确保让「每一个人都有‘闪光时刻’，都能有机会把最好的自己展示出来。」【30】不赞同对「更优秀」的朗诵者的特别优待。没有人会被「遗忘在角落」。</p><p>「搞怪瘸子帮」剧团就像那时候的很多团体一样，就意识形态而言在团队合作的过程中并不顺畅，有时甚至是充满争执。但是，据帕蒂·奥芙兰所说，有一点是团队内部全体认同的：将她们自己展现得性感。「不论是直的还是弯的，我们想让大家知道我们为了自己的性而骄傲，因为人们总是（会说）‘就那些人，她们哪儿谈得上性感？’」【31】</p><p>文学评论家兰纳德·戴维斯提出，残障人士往往被「去情欲化」（de-eroticized）【32】。早期统计数据印证了戴维斯的这个观点，去情欲化对残障女性造成了特定负担。【33】较一般女性而言，残障女性更不容易结婚，同时更易遭到离婚。与已婚残障男性相比，当病情发作时，已婚残障女性更易遭到离婚或分居。残障女性被否定的角色恰恰是非残障女性当时极力想要摆脱的：母亲和妻子。无法得到女性传统社会角色的接纳，使得一部分残障女性主义者们形容自己为「社会流浪者」，因为再没有其他称呼了。【34】</p><p>「搞怪瘸子帮」剧团因庆祝性和残障女性的身体而被大众所知。在推动这一方向中，或许没有任何人能比谢丽尔·玛丽·韦德更有发言权。韦德有渐进性幼年型类风湿性关节炎，双手的状态让她尤为窘迫。她回忆道：「多年来我一直拿着一个披肩或是一个大挎包，这样我就能把自己的手伸进去，人们就不会感觉不舒服，我也不会被人们的目光所羞辱了。」【35】</p><p>一开始韦德和剧团一起表演时，她把自己从脖子到脚裹进宽松的、看不出身型的衣服里。她的声音始终在场——迷人且动听，时而又变成柔软性感的粗嗓门、用着嘲讽的语气。但当她的表演自信逐渐增长，「伪装剥落了」。她穿上了裙子，这样当她说起自己爱人对她的观察「你膝盖上的疤在一起好像两瓣嘴唇，在微笑」时，她便撩起来让大家看。伤疤是真实存在的，无声的康康舞（译校注：康康舞为一种 19 世纪末起源于法国的音乐厅舞蹈，著名呈现如《红磨坊》）也同样真实。有一首情诗叫《变形的无尾礼服》，写了两个刚刚恋爱的人，喝着红酒，谈着丹麦哲学家齐克果，看着猫咪晃动的尾巴，等待夜幕降临。诗如是写道：</p><blockquote><p>当天空变作深夜的蓝</p><p>你起誓，而我深信不疑</p><p>我蜷曲的爪子</p><p>是闪烁的银色月光 【36】</p></blockquote><p>然而，韦德对残障政治立场中的部分观点——如果社会歧视和偏见都被消除，那么残障人士就可以平等地参与社会生活——表示怀疑。对于韦德来说，这个说法拒不承认是「身体的能力」在决定我们什么可以做、什么不能。疼痛也随之被否认，因为「这和我们努力展现自己有力强大的形象格格不入」【37】她总结道：「<strong>你可以既强大又破碎。你可以在坚强的同时有着非比寻常的伤痛和苦楚。</strong>」【38】重申差异而非平等，这是韦德的作品本身告诉我们的，它将艺术从政治主张中区分开来。</p><p></p><h2><strong>05. AXIS 舞团和身体差异性</strong></h2><blockquote><p>对我来说最大的差异在于，我们说（《P.H.*恶作剧》的演员们）是一个整体，但她们每个人又完全不同，这比（我之前合作过的）任何团体都更多样。【39】</p><p>——内奥米·戈德堡，编舞《P.H.*恶作剧》：讲述残障人士隐秘的历史由「别的声音」剧团创作，1994

【40】膝盖受伤把她从传统舞蹈的世界中分离开来，推动她参与接触即兴，接触非传统学生。即便经验丰富至此，《P.H.*恶作剧》中的八个演员也还是为戈德堡打开了新的篇章。</p><p>形成一种集体声音的困难从始至终伴随着残障戏剧创作。谢丽尔·玛丽·韦德就曾因为自己的诗《野蛮女孩》与「搞怪瘸子帮」剧团的另一位成员发生了争执。模仿跳绳的节奏，以伯克利大街上大胆的残障女性为灵感，这首诗赞美着「畸形足的安妮穿着闪亮的红鞋」，以及「目盲的老威尔玛每天读一本小说」。共有八位女性出现在诗中，并伴随着八种不同的障别。但剧团的一位成员拒绝出演这首诗，因为她觉得这首诗没能把所有的残障类型都覆盖到。</p><p>回顾 AXIS 舞团的历史——一个在 20 世纪 80 年代末诞生、致力于残障舞者和非残障舞者融合的团体【41】，可以看到 AXIS 始终在与残障女性集体作品中的主要矛盾进行角力：非残障领导者与残障领导者，业余主义与专业主义，服务于整个社群与服务于个体艺术。但究其根源，AXIS 舞团一直以来都在舞台上展现那些不符合传统舞蹈中「理想」身体的、曾被视为禁忌的、只适合出现在怪人秀和医疗展示中的身体。忌讳是如此严重，以至于 1994 年，《纽约客》的舞蹈评论家阿勒尼·克罗齐拒绝出席观看比尔·T·琼斯与一些患有不治之症的人所创作的作品《依然如故（Still Here）》，并称其为「受害者艺术」【42】。如果克罗齐的文章是想要阻止「不合适的身体」再次出现在大型音乐厅的舞台上，那么它失败了。作为回应，舞蹈经纪人杰瑞米·阿里戈开始了对全球范围内融合艺术团体的研究，并于 1997 年在波士顿制作了第一个轮椅舞国际艺术节。从世界各地而来的团体以对话和舞动的方式讲述着彼此的故事。阿里戈邀请 AXIS 舞团主理人朱迪·史密斯一起策划艺术节，在波士顿，史密斯渐渐走出以社群为基础的艺术，转向了更具挑战性的专业舞蹈领域。</p><figure class="image"><img

找到了归宿。因此，当史密斯从波士顿回到奥克兰，她所提议的邀请职业（即「非残障」）编舞家进行创作的想法受到了冷遇。联合创始人泰安斯·马祖尔就是反对者之一。但是，马祖尔作为一个非残障的舞团成员本身就已是矛盾。创团十年，马祖尔和她的男性伴侣依然主导着面向残障群体的舞蹈工作坊，依然假定这一位置所需的专业性，依然坚持把这样的工作仅当作为教化工具去培养残障意识。</p><p>史密斯最终获得了舞团的控制权，并与世界一流的编舞家如桑雅·戴尔怀德、乔·古德、玛格丽特·詹金斯、史蒂芬·彼得罗尼奥、维多利亚·马克思以及比尔·T·琼斯等展开了合作。舞团以行动向那些对融合舞蹈概念说不的人发出挑战。【46】</p><p>据史密斯所述，2014 年舞团的工作流程，与在泰安斯·马祖尔指导时的流程并无大的改变。身体的差异性是玄妙的，即便是在创始人史密斯和邦妮·莱克维兹之间也不例外。史密斯解释道：「我们以完全不同的方式舞动——我们是不可互换的。」【47】非残障舞者的体重和身高也被列入建立复杂而充满运动性的组合的考虑之中，轮椅的种类也是。所有人——包括世界一流的编舞家——都在努力思考可以在一起创作出什么的问题。</p><p>比尔·T·琼斯于 2000 年为 AXIS 编创了舒伯特的《C 调狂想曲》，回顾这段经历时，他说自己努力「去找到一个具有共享性的舞动语汇」。【48】作为一个以齐舞见长的编舞家，他「惊讶于在身体能动性不同的表演者之间找同步性，需要付出多么大的努力。在这儿，每个人的胳膊、躯干和腿都遵循着不同的运动规则，或者说根本没有规则。」琼斯纠结于是否将「快速运动（跑步、行走、跳跃）加入到韵律之中——和轮椅一起，无论是手动的还是电动的。」对于琼斯来说，这些差异带来的是美学上的新可能，而非政治意义上的绊脚石。【49】</p><p>正如比尔·T·琼斯所言，在 AXIS 的作品当中，「每个人都可以被看作是一份文本」，而这些身体所形成的「星系」，则共同构成了故事本身。从 AXIS 众多的肉身和钢铁之中生发出来的，是新创造、新现实和新神话。《纽约时报》评论员布鲁斯·韦伯在他关于 AXIS 的文章中如此建议读者：</p><blockquote><p>「同情」与此毫不相关。忘掉什么不在场，去关注什么在场。看到轮椅本身，而不是把它看成是什么的替代品。看到了吗？……轮椅倾向一侧，一只轮子在空中翻飞，一名舞者在轮椅之上横躺着，缓慢而优雅地旋转着，是轮椅成就了这样一副动人的画面。【50】</p></blockquote><p>AXIS 舞团百花齐放的图景反映在对区别与平等的调和中。在这一过程中，<strong>受损的身体并不被归于一个四肢可被修复、轮椅使用者可以重新在田野间奔跑的泛泛的天堂，而是转向于充分认识并最大限度地开发舞团成员的身体差异。</strong>「受损」的身体所使用的助行类辅具，被整合入艺术性的舞动当中，平等不仅存在于团队规范和受到保护的个人自主权当中，还在相互依存的网络中得到充分体现。几十年的创作历程，使得 AXIS 融合舞团在如何找到平等和差异之间平衡的问题上，提供了启发性的范例。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f11a4676-f799-4d96-a109-080f180bef18.jpeg/public"

结语</strong></h2><p>集体创作在美国剧场界的民主化进程当中充当着不可或缺的角色，同时它也是民主化进程在美学和公民意识上的重要成果。正如我们所见，身体本身是戏剧改革的号召力所在。尽管在科班培训和职业雇佣当中的固有偏见依然存在，但边缘群体依旧在剧场实践当中寻找突破口，树立人类新典型。</p><p>但我并非在忽视长久以来将「残障」假定为负面形象所带来的伤害，这种假设依旧阴魂不散于我们的排练室中和舞台之上。希望这些简短的案例分析能够较为清晰地让读者注意到，<strong>剧场和舞蹈界（无论是传统的还是自由派的，女性主义的还是混合的）的准入规则看似平等，然而平等的标准依然以健全身体为前提，且未曾经过检验和反思。</strong>本文所列举出的成果，实际上在向整个行业发问：如果我们去注重差异，对依存和病弱去污名化，我们还将收获多少？</p><p>本文更广的道德启示则是剧场艺术家们每天都在实践的，即：绝对的独立是不可能的。正如一些进化生物学家所提出的假说，人类物种成功的关键并非是「适者生存」，而是聚在一起，相互依存，共建集体。</p><p><br

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkyOTAwOTQwMg==&amp;mid=2247488318&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=fd6db18b16b501cbdc710c12cfe41969&amp;chksm=c21148abf566c1bdd89f33c8cdecc17d53ee002d89eedb91aa8d1ebc543b9749039068a63ae6&amp;scene=21#wechat_redirect">星空艺术节</a>的节目经理，我有幸接触并学习了不少国内外残障/融合艺术团体创作的优秀作品，但由于偏线上工作的性质，我对本地残障团体以及 TA 们真实的生活状态缺乏深度了解，因此会质疑自己是否能够由残障人士的主体性出发去思考问题，觉得自己作为普遍意义上的「健全人」从事与残障相关的工作缺乏正当性。而文中展现的残障研究和女性主义学说之间的关联为我提供了一个新的视角：即通过作为女性的生活经验去接近残障人士的生活经验，去发现其中的种种共通之处与差异。这将是一个崭新的、能够赋予我极大信心的起点，带我逐步走进真正的了解与共情。</p><p>以上是我阅读、翻译之间的感悟，如也能对大家有所启发是我的荣幸！最后，作为表演艺术从业者，同时也作为表演艺术常年的观众，我想要向大家着重提及文中对于欣赏残障团体艺术作品的动人表述：</p><blockquote><p>「‘同情’与此毫不相关。忘掉什么不在场，去关注什么在场。看到轮椅本身，而不是把它看成是什么的替代品。看到了吗？……轮椅倾向一侧，一只轮子在空中翻飞，一名舞者在轮椅之上横躺着，缓慢而优雅地旋转着，是轮椅成就了这样一副动人的画面。」</p></blockquote><p>未来，希望我们都能够抛开「同情」的枷锁，心无旁骛地去欣赏、去赞美、去创作。</p><h2><strong>最新文章（持续更新）</strong></h2><ol

                <![CDATA[<p>经常有人吐槽我的文章难懂，但为照顾我感受，总是婉委地说我写得很好，只是自己不懂技术，或者已经老了，所以才没看懂。不过，有一位老伯——相信他不介意我这样称呼，毕竟我都是大叔了，不尊称「伯」才说不过去吧——不但不懂技术，英文不好，连电脑都没有，却始终没有放弃认识区块链、分散式出版、AI 等新趋势。他是今期主角，现年七十七岁的 Raymond，威文。</p><h2>勇者的黄昏</h2><p>打从早年我到处介绍 LikeCoin，威文兄就经常出席大小线下聚会，又经常给我发邮件，提出诸如扩阔应用场景、在地推广等多项建议，要不是威文兄不适应 Discord 等社交软体而坚持只用电邮，相信社群讨论气氛必定热闹不少。虽然我很抱歉威文兄的大部分建议都因为 LikeCoin 资源有限、定位狭窄而没法实现，但我很感激他的参与，细阅并回复了他几年来的所有邮件。</p><p>随著疫情，我跟威文几年没见，直到半年前我在艺术评论家协会办分散式出版工作坊，才再次遇上久违了的威文，他虽然没有笔记本电脑没法动手参与，但也耐心地听毕全程。工作坊后，我跟威文从赛马会创意艺术中心走到附近耀东街的传奇大排档宵夜。</p><p>谈起耀东街，虽然不过短短一条单程路，却已占了全港只剩廿来间的大排档里头的四间，当中以手打鱼蛋、墨鱼丸、豉油捞面等驰名的长发面家更已有七十年历史，一直在此经营，却因为旁边的新楼盘被逼结业，最后营业的日子刚好为昨天。</p><figure

把小说翻译成英语，再应用区块链相关技术出版成双语电子书。</p><p>我本来就支持创作尤其是书写，威文兄又分属老友，更是社群的中坚份子，我没有推辞的理由。连自己的旧作都没有时间翻译和推出电子版，就拍拍胸口，信口开河答应帮忙出版<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<blockquote><h3><strong>以色列的民族政策对于在以色列的巴勒斯坦人的影响是怎样的？</strong></h3></blockquote><p><br class="smart">@*Kang</p><p>我理解的是生存状况越差这种想法的人会越多：「如果不能活的像个人，不如去以色列 boom，一个不赔两个算赚」<br class="smart"></p><p>@*临</p><p>是的，这个我的观感差不多。巴勒斯坦人民本来追随的是法塔赫，看哈马斯是极端。自从挨了铁拳（真铁打的那种不是口嗨铁拳，全家就一个半个完整人的那种）就觉得哈马斯太保守，法塔赫是汪精衞了。以色列炸学校，是害怕巴勒斯坦对学生进行极端思想的洗脑教育。可问题是，书本上的千言万语，都不如窗户上储水箱上被以军士兵取乐的弹孔管用，更不如家人脑门上被以军打出来的弹孔管用，这个教育比哈佛耶鲁的教学质量都好。</p><p></p><p>@*自决</p><p>我不知道以色列的民族政策是什么，所以我去看了那篇论文，其中有段是这么写的：「在建国前，犹太社团就注意并利用了这些差异和矛盾，其成果之一就是德鲁兹社团在阿犹冲突中基本保持了中立，在 1948 年战争时甚至有不少德鲁兹人加入以军作战，因为‘自从犹太人来了德鲁兹人享受到比在穆斯林治下更多的自由。’建国后以色列国家继续利用阿拉伯社团内部的各种矛盾，刻意从政治、经济及社会方面分化不同群体。」看到这我就看不下去了。德鲁兹人觉得以色列更好，于是加入了以色列，他却认为这是以色列刻意分化不同群体，难道德鲁兹人没有自决的权力吗？</p><p>以色列确实存在对巴勒斯坦人的歧视，但我认为这种歧视来自对伊斯兰教的恐惧，因为他们总和独裁，厌女，恐怖袭击有关。以色列社会有在为消除这种歧视的做着努力。在海法，巴勒斯坦人和犹太人是能共存的。When 20-year-old Aya Najame, an Arab Muslim, was a little girl growing up in the northern Israeli port city of Haifa, she would go on cultural exchange trips to Jewish schools to learn about the Jewish way of life. Jewish children would do the same, visiting Najame’s school to learn about her life.Haifa is not like the rest of Israel, Najame says.「We live together here, Arab people and Jewish people. We work together, we go to the same places,」 she told CNN.</p><p>打破这种平静的不是以色列的民族政策，而是恐怖袭击。Naim Khoury, a lawyer who lives in Haifa, said the city is normally an oasis of coexistence. The 39-year-old lawyer, who lives in Haifa, said the fallout from the brutality of October is being felt even there, in a city usually considered a case study of successful coexistence.「Some people look at us with suspicion now because we are Arabs. And being an Arab means being a terrorist,」 he told CNN. 「But we condemn terrorists, we condemn everything they have done and we (mourn) every life lost.」Khoury said that he has many friends who serve in the military and the police, and yet even they sometimes face similar suspicion.「In Haifa, we always try to preserve the good relations and to have this coexistence and so it’s very sad that every time anything to do with security happens, Jews are automatically asking me, ‘What do you think about it as an Arab, are you okay with this?’ 」 he said.</p><p>相关链接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener

2007 年的封锁行动与哈马斯掌权有着较为直接的联系，有其缘由，值得进一步探讨。</p><p>「哈马斯」组织本次的军事行动代号为「阿克萨洪水」。这个代号很讲究。「阿克萨」是一座清真寺的名字，该清真寺的地位仅次于麦加圣寺和麦地那先知寺。位于以色列耶路撒冷老城的圣殿山（穆斯林称「尊贵禁地」）。</p><p>相关链接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer

年来，生活在那里的巴勒斯坦人民一直处于以色列实际上相当于封锁的长期关闭和严厉的经济和行动限制之下。实际上，近 200 万人大多被限制在一块 365 平方公里的飞地上，该地是世界上人口密度最高的地区之一。进入加沙地带的货物仅限于基本的人道主义产品。1 除长期关闭和严厉的经济和行动限制之外，加沙在六年中 (从 2008 年 12 月开始) 还遭受了三轮重大敌对行动，导致生产基地被摧毁，而随后发生的严重危机则使加沙地带变成人道主义问题，使加沙严重依赖援助。此外，巴勒斯坦内部分裂对加沙发展构成重大挑战。加沙是全球经济表现最差的地区之一，也是世界失业率最高的地区，3 一半以上人口生活在贫困线以下。绝大多数人口无法获得清洁用水、电或适当的污水系统，而且，加沙地带的环境严重恶化。自 2007 年开始关闭和严厉的经济和行动限制以来，加沙的巴勒斯坦人民经历了 13 年来周围条件的持续恶化。</p><p>相关链接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

年根据联合国大会决议要求，向联大提交的一份题为《以色列占领给巴勒斯坦人民造成的经济代价：关闭和限制下的加沙地带》的报告原文，供大家参考。「值得注意的是，在自 2007 年开始的对加沙地带长达 16 年的封锁中，加沙地带的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人的生存条件日渐恶劣，贫困水平恶化，基础设施遭到破坏。这种行为可能无法广泛代表以色列人对巴勒斯坦人的态度，但这种行为可能直接导致在加沙地区生存巴勒斯坦人对以色列态度的恶化。回顾近十几年的历史，温水煮青蛙一般的封锁行动本身也是打破平静、破坏地区居民基本生存发展权的事件之一。」</p><figure class="image"><img

51 条。根据这一条款，成员国有权在受到武装攻击时采取自衞行动，直至联合国安理会采取必要的措施来维护国际和平与安全。</p></li><li><p>自衞的条件：通常来说，只有在受到武装攻击时，国家才能行使自衞权。而且，自衞行动应当是立即的、必要的，并且与攻击的规模和性质相适应。</p></li><li><p>集体自衞和预防自衞，但不在本次话题讨论范围中。</p></li></ol><p>基于此认识，那位联合国官员认为以色列是有普遍意义的自衞权的，比如遭受的其他国家的侵略，以色列当然可以像乌克兰一样拿起武器保衞祖国，这个观点我是认同的。</p><p></p><p>@*临</p><p>在传统的国际法框架下，这个自衞通常被理解为一个国家在受到其他国家的武装攻击时，采取必要的、适度的军事行动以保护其主权和领土完整。这种自衞的理解基于国家间的相互关系和国家主权的基本原则。但是这一原则在反恐面前受到了一定程度的挑战。比如在 9/11 恐怖袭击之后，其面临的主要威胁来自非国家行为者，特别是恐怖组织如基地组织。这些组织没有固定的领土基础，也不受任何国家法律的约束，但它们的行动对美国和其盟国构成了严重的安全威胁。在这种情况下，美国通过国际法中的自衞权概念应用于非国家行为者的威胁，从而为其反恐战争提供法律依据。但是，这样做也带来了一些负面影响，我前文中就讲到这些影响，这里不赘述。这里以色列和美国一直主张的所谓自衞权，在我看来倒不如换成「镇压权」更准确。以色列不承认巴勒斯坦是个国家，也就丧失了传统意义上的联合国宪章的第 51 条定义的自衞，其单边的军事行动不能认为是战争。他们不能两头都占便宜。以色列不承认巴勒斯坦是个国家，也就丧失了传统意义上的联合国宪章的第 51 条定义的自衞，其单边的军事行动不能认为是战争。他们不能两头都占便宜。需要尊重主权的时候说巴勒斯坦不是国家，需要报复的时候说我们有国与国之间的自衞权，这是双标。</p><p></p><p>@*利</p><p>那么在本次事件的初始阶段您认为是「自衞」的成分多一点，还是「镇压」的成分多一点呢？我这样问是因为本次哈马斯对音乐会发动的袭击完全符合恐袭的三个基本定义:使用暴力，政治目的，针对平民。</p><p></p><p>@*临</p><p>我认为就是报复，用铁血对野蛮的报复。以色列如果自称是文明国家，就要有着比野蛮更高的标准。就像秦晖说的：世界上只有不择手段的邪恶，根本不存在什么不择手段的正义。就是这个道理。</p><p></p><p>@*羽</p><p>您好，我想问一下，自衞权只能针对主权国家发动的国际法根据是什么呢？或者说，是否有国际成文法或国际习惯法禁止一个主权国家向自己不承认为主权国家的政治实体发动自衞权？</p><p></p><p>@*临</p><p>第五十一条：联合国任何会员国受武力攻击时，在安全理事会采取必要办法，以维持国际和平及安全以前，本宪章不得认为禁止行使单独或集体自衞之自然权利。会员国因行使此项自衞权而采取之办法，应立向安全理事会报告，此项办法于任何方面不得影响该会按照本宪章随时采取其所认为必要行动之权责，以维持或恢复国际和平及安全。</p><p>相关链接：<a

一样。这种单方面的军事行动，受到的政治法律约束比战争更多。这种单方面的军事行动，它的对象、目标是不明确的，外延模糊的，无时间限制的。这和传统意义上的战争是有很大的区别的。</p><p></p><p>@*羽</p><p>所以，是否有国际法（包括成文法，习惯法，和国际仲裁机构的判例）指出一个主权国家不得针对一个未被其承认为主权国家的政治实体发起自衞权呢？但是并没有任何联合国宪章的条款将第 51 条的适用范围限定于「战争」，第 51 条全文没有使用「战争/war」一词。</p><p></p><p>@*dyyy</p><p>以色列的口径是战争，这个有出处吗？</p><p></p><p>@*临</p><p>现在，以色列声称「第二阶段战争」已开始了。</p><p></p><p>@*羽</p><p>在过往的军事冲突中，我们实际上经常能够看到一个国家的武装力量针对一个其不承认为主权国家/尚未建交的政治实体的行为行驶自衞权的情况。2001 年 12 月 22 日日本海上保安厅与朝鲜侦察船之间的交火就是一个典型例子，在这一事件后，国际社会和国际法学界几乎没有（我从未看到过，也没检索到）指控「由于日本没有正式承认北朝鲜政府，所以日本海上执法部门不得行使自衞权/不得向其侦察船还击并追击」。</p><p>（在这里说一下我关于相关话题的个人看法：我认为以色列针对哈马斯的武装袭击有自衞权，但是当前的轰炸和地面军事行动显著地超出了自衞权的范围，其中有一些可以被形容为「打着自衞权名义的武装攻击」，和自衞行为已经没有实质上的联系。我认为以色列的行动超出了自衞权的范围/和自衞行为已经没有实质上的联系的国际习惯法依据是 1837 年的卡洛莱茵事件（Caroline affair）中提出的「韦伯斯特（Webster）基准」。「韦伯斯特基准」可能更多在日文资料或由日文资料翻译而来的资料中看到，可能在更多的英文资料中用「卡洛莱茵基准（Caroline test）」表示。</p><p>相关链接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

1986 年的尼加拉瓜案，这是国际法庭（International Court of Justice, ICJ）的一个重要案例，也许能回答你的问题。</p><p>「【Israel’s claim of self-defense in the recent conflict is evocative of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), a previous dispute over international law that was decided by the ICJ in 1968. During the Nicaraguan Contra War, the Fuerza Democratic Nicaraguense (FDN) and the Alianza Revolucionaria Democratic (ARDE), assisted by U.S.-backed contras groups, enacted violence against the new government of Nicaragua. When the Marxist Sandinistas took power following the Nicaraguan revolution, the U.S. supported the contras in rising against the new government, seeking to curb the spread of communism in Latin America. Nicaragua subsequently claimed that the United States was threatening to overthrow its government, to which the U.S. responded that the attacks occurred for self-defense purposes. [5] To reach a decision, the ICJ first consulted Article 51 of the UN Charter, from which it found that Nicaragua had not committed an 「armed attack」 against the United States. This, according to the Court, rendered the U.S. ineligible to claim the right to self-defense. Ultimately, the Court ruled in favor of Nicaragua, finding that the US committed several international law violations, in particular, violating the sovereignty of Nicaragua. The ICJ concluded that the US was 「in breach of its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another State.」 】这段。</p><p>相关链接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.culawreview.org/journal/the-self-defense-principle-re-examined-the-israel-palestine-conflict-in-international-law">https://www.culawreview.org/journal/the-self-defense-principle-re-examined-the-israel-palestine-conflict-in-international-law</a></p><p></p><p>@*羽</p><p>尼加拉瓜诉美国案和当前的巴以冲突有一个很大的区别在于：在美国向尼加拉瓜港口布设水雷之前，尼加拉瓜并没有对美国进行任何武力攻击，这也是 ICJ 判断美国无权行使美方所声称的自衞权的根本依据。但是在这次冲突中，哈马斯武装人员无可置疑地发动了武装袭击。因此，尼加拉瓜诉美国案的判例对现阶段巴以冲突的适用性我个人认为是非常有限的。当然，尼加拉瓜诉美国案判例对规范「自衞权」的概念是有很大积极意义的：一国不能以「对方有‘侵略倾向’」为借口对实际上未发生的武装攻击「提前行使」自衞权。</p><p></p><p>@*自决</p><p>你从哪里听到的报道是以色列巴勒斯坦战争？难道不是 Israel-Hamas war? 这几篇新闻标题都清楚的写着 Israel-Hamas War</p><p>相关链接：</p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/2/israel-hamas-war-live-195-killed-120-missing-in-jabalia-strikes">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/2/israel-hamas-war-live-195-killed-120-missing-in-jabalia-strikes</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-11-01-23/index.html">https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-11-01-23/index.html</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/israel-hamas-war-idf-releases-video-shows-forces-enter-gaza/videoshow/104908635.cm">https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/israel-hamas-war-idf-releases-video-shows-forces-enter-gaza/videoshow/104908635.cm</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war">https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/02/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news">https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/02/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news</a></p></li></ul><p>War 是什么意思?</p><p>相关链接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/war">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/war</a></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>以上讨论整理自「行动行动」发起的针对巴以问题慢讨论。</p><p>行动误差，必有遗漏。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9a7852ae-0299-4d35-9f05-c84407c437f9.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>入群添加</figcaption></figure><p><strong>「行动行动」讨论群基于以下规则（详细规则见群内）：</strong></p><ul><li><p>表述完整，拒绝短句连发。</p></li><li><p>消息源介绍，引用段落或截图。</p></li><li><p>反驳时引用对方发言，或简短反问。</p></li><li><p>不求即时回应，克制伦理冲动。</p></li><li><p>不求信息完全精确，但请表述清晰。</p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Day 3，11 月 3 日议题：</strong></p><p>联合国秘书长古特雷斯说：「哈马斯袭击并非凭空发生」。提问：具体应该如何把这个事件放在一个更长的历史座标中和更宽的国际背景中去理解？放在多大的历史背景里看最合适？最近 15 年以色列右倾化的期间？75 年前联合国分治决议以色列建国？从奥斯曼帝国开始看？还是有其他方式？</p><p>相关链接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://news.un.org/zh/story/2023/10/1123462">https://news.un.org/zh/story/2023/10/1123462</a></p>

            </title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>前段时间在 YouTube 收看过不少煮食影片。可能就此给 YouTube 的人工智能掌握了我的兴趣，于是三不五时就会推荐更多烹饪频道给我。而「厨职背游梁子玲」，就是其中一个推荐给我的烹饪频道。</p><p>起初觉得这个频道的名字怪怪的。也是因着这一点点的好奇，点进了其中一枝烹饪影片。看完之后就真的不得了，无论是煮食、旅行，还是专访，都一枝一枝影片看下去，越看越喜欢了。</p><p>梁子玲，一个八零后女生。大学时修读新闻系，后前往英国留学，修读媒体管理硕士课程。在留学期间还揹包旅行了十多个国家。现居英国任职厨师，梦想是在英国开设一家餐厅。</p><p>因着她的揹包旅行经历，她曾为《苹果日报》的旅游专栏供稿，也有替《苹果日报》访问在英港人，探讨他们对大量港人移民英国的看法。</p><p>「厨职背游梁子玲」这个频道的诞生，正是因为《苹果日报》的被迫结业。梁子玲凭著自己担任厨师的技能，以及揹包旅行的经历充实了频道的内容，也藉著这些内容，帮助了刚刚移英的香港人，也鼓励了仍然留在香港的香港人。</p><p>频道的节目大致上分为三大类。第一类是煮食系列，分享在英国购买各类食材煮出港式𩠌菜和餐点的技巧。第二类是背游系列，介绍英国、法国等地的有趣景点；第三类则是发掘其他海外港人的故事进行报导。我最喜欢她的烹饪系列，不但能买菜学英文，还能启发我更多煮食灵感。例如我很爱吃港式菠萝包。但总觉得坊间的食谱做起来很费时。梁子玲示范以组合半成品（曲奇面团和餐包面团），的方法制作菠萝包，甚至用曲奇面团与已烤熟餐包的组合，快速做好菠萝包。由于我每星期都会做十多个餐包给自己与家人做早餐。有了这样的方法，我想自己做个菠萝包现烤现吃就方便多了。只要预先做好曲奇面团放在冷冻库，什么时候想吃个菠萝包，挖一小球曲奇面团压扁盖上现成餐包，再放进烤箱烤一下就有新鲜热剌的懒人菠萝包吃了。多么美好呢！</p><p>无论是烹饪、背游，抑或与移英港人的访谈，只要留心，观众不难在最平凡，最不起眼的内容中发现彩蛋。例如在以下这枝烹饪影片的最后，我听到这番话：</p><p>「凝聚力量的方法很多。可以透过煮食、足球、音乐。也可以是大家一起就地取材。无论身处何方，都继续做自己相信的事情。」</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esGwt_35yuA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esGwt_35yuA</a></p><p>命运这东西很奇妙，祂会把人带到自己当初想都没想过的地方。梁子玲留学与背游期间由于积蓄有限，不得不边读书/旅行边工作。而在欧洲读书或旅行，最容易找到的工作就是厨师。梁子玲凭著看影片学到的烹饪本领，以及留学期间自家煮食的经验，让她获得厨师的工作。也正因为厨师的工作，令她后来能制作很多分享在英国超市买食材做港式菜的影片。这些影片对于刚到英国的香港人，提供了非常实质的帮助。</p><p>看梁子玲的影片令我对个体与时代，有了更深入的思考。梁子玲的经历，是属于她自己的，但同时也与这个香港人大离散的时代紧密地结连。曾听说时代的一粒灰尘跌在一个人的头上，有如一座大山。但我们又怎能肯定个体之于时代，不能成为举足兴讼的那个板块呢？</p>

年，哈佛的皮博迪博物馆出版了弗雷德里克对两次考察的记录，但是直到 2003 年我们才看到珍妮的文字和照片。在这本《消失的王国》里，珍妮·伍尓辛的信件和照片把我们带回到卓尼、定远营等已经消失的边疆政权。这批史料让我们有机会从女性视角重新思考西方博物学与中国的遭遇。</p><figure class="image"><img

class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/cf64c36e-6f99-4a83-a861-c3d623d9aa23.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>Janet Elliott Wulsin，1921。图源：作者</figcaption></figure><p><strong>但是，女性很可能只是由于殖民制度的限制才没能参与博物学知识的生产。</strong>很多欧洲国家一直到十九世纪中后期都不允许女性到殖民地去谋生，它们担心女性的大量出现将有损欧洲文明在全世界的强健形象，还有种担心是如果有大量妻子跟着丈夫到海外，这些家庭将因为开销的增加而要求补助，否则就会因为陷入赤贫而转向对布尔什维克的认同，这两种情况都将增加殖民政府在治理上的负担和难度。因此在很长一段时间，一些国家只允许单身男性到海外殖民地去淘金，由此造成的是人口性别比例在母国的失衡。1911 年，英国女性人口比男性多了一百三十万，为了避免多出来的女性无法找到配偶，欧洲各国放松了对女性流动的管制。</p><p>人们期待走出去的女性能继续在新定居的土地上按照欧洲标准操持家务，保证丈夫和孩子能继续保有对母国文化的认同。在这个白人家庭观的统治下，跨种族的亲密关系成为禁忌，与土著有染的殖民官员必须要离职，白人妻子因此被视为维护种族边界的最保守的势力。乔治·奥威尔通过一个叫伊丽莎白的女人在自己的《缅甸岁月》里展示了这套话语的影响。在他的书里，这个角色没有任何财产和谋生的技能，在母亲死后到缅甸投奔亲戚。她厌恶缅甸的文化和市集，厌恶缅甸女性的长相和身体。为此，她拒绝了一个与缅甸人有染的开明军官的追求，选择嫁给年长的行政署长作太太。奥威尔批判了这个白人太太群体和她们创造的封闭的圈子：「与生俱来的冷漠刻毒越来越彰显，仆人们都很怕她（伊丽莎白）。她总是举办令人陶醉的晚宴，知道如何接待下属官员的老婆……。」但是，这套话语在某种程度上把殖民者的妻子当做体系的替罪羊，用她们来解释殖民体系与地方社会的脱节。有个说法是一旦有了这些女性，她们的丈夫就必须筑起高墙来保证她们过得舒适，避免她们在土著人的怒火下遭到强暴。男性官员因此无法拉近与当地人的距离。这套污名化的说法暗示着在海外生活的女性很可能无法像男性那样，自由地探索身边那些她们或许会感兴趣的世界。</p><figure

class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/e2196f79-0738-40f3-b852-f79296780177.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>The first expedition。图源：作者</figcaption></figure><p>一九二二年五月，弗雷德里克回到美国养病。他告诉岳父自己没有在中国找到商机，但是看到了一条通过学术攀升的通道。他认为中国的少数民族迟早会引起学界的兴趣，如果能利用搜集标本的机会研究这些民族，他有信心在哈佛找到一份工作，然后利用自己在中国的人脉涉足政坛。不管有没有说服自己的岳父，弗雷德里克说服了国家地理学会的主席。他和珍妮将得到一笔两年的资助，这一次他们以考察中国少数民族为目标。</p><p></p><h2>03</h2><p>一九二三年，伍尓辛夫妇在北平组建起新的队伍。起初他们想要去贵州，但是最终选择了相对安定的西北。两个人的朋友里有不少曾访问过西北，他们都认为这不会是场一帆风顺的旅行。当时最了解西北的是在戈壁滩发现恐龙蛋化石的安得思。安得思的夫人告诉珍妮，自己在安得思考察时就待在北平，而且她也从来没听说过有哪个女人会跟着丈夫去边疆。这让珍妮更不想离开自己在北平的圈子，她觉得这个圈子很像她曾经生活过的巴黎，她也非常喜欢北平这座城市在精神层面给她的刺激。上次来中国，她最喜欢的就是用古董店淘来的家具、丝绸、毛毯、字画布置自己在水磨胡同的小家。这让她意识到自己想要的不是风餐露宿的冒险。漂泊对她而言，可能更像是寻找一个足够舒适的可以称之为家的地方。</p><p>这个家里不能没有弗雷德里克，她的丈夫，所以珍妮选择了牺牲。她剪短了头发，在写给父母的信里，她说你们精心培养的女儿已经「永远地死了」，镜子里的短发女人要成为「草原上的野花」。考察队先到达包头。从那里，他们穿过腾格里沙漠到兰州，然后从兰州到更远的西宁和藏区。弗雷德里克和珍妮会平安度过路上的每一道劫难，不仅包括沙尘暴、劫匪和断水，还包括削弱人意志的鸦片。每隔一段时间，他们就要挑一个地方休整。不管是巴彦浩特的定远营旗府，兰州城种满罂粟的小楼，还是卓尼土司拨给他们的木屋，在每一个这样的地方，珍妮总是坚持用自己挑选的家具装饰它们，打造出生活的仪式感和家的氛围。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/7a2e22b7-8f41-49cb-bc9b-20415ba50fe8.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>The second expedition。图源：作者</figcaption></figure><p>但是像绝大多数丈夫，弗雷德里克忽略了珍妮的感受。他总是焦虑于工作，焦虑于自己能否控制住考察的预算，能否满足国家地理学会对照片和标本的期待。那个年代的考察者为了大机构的合同面临激烈的竞争。在他们出发前，国家地理学会答应弗雷德里克要在二月和三月的杂志里宣传这次考察，但是一直等到八月，他们都没有看到文字。弗雷德里克写给国家地理学会的报告一直没有收到回信，他寄出去的礼物也没有消息。在甘南，考察队收到了一份哈佛寄出的册子，里面提到了所有在中国考察的美国探险队，唯独没有提到他们。弗雷德里克万分沮丧，觉得自己已经被遗忘。珍妮只有在与亲友通信时才敢吐露对丈夫的担忧。她相信丈夫只是由于运气不好才没有爆炸性的发现，而且她觉得弗雷德里克不像安得思或洛克那样善于炒作自己。在写给《国家地理杂志》的文章里，洛克宣称自己最早拍摄了卓尼的羌姆法会，但是他到卓尼的时间实际上晚于弗雷德里克和珍妮。为了增加弗雷德里克的曝光度，珍妮甚至写信给家人，希望他们能利用在纽约和华盛顿的关系施加些影响。</p><p><strong>让人惊讶的是，即使已经做出如此巨大的妥协和牺牲，珍妮还是会担心拖丈夫的后腿。</strong>她在写给母亲的信里提道：「弗雷德里克热爱他的工作，热爱中国和他研究的问题。他的想法已经开始像个学者……但是问题在于我。这种生活虽然很有趣，可是我不想永远这样过。」她不想让两人的婚姻失去共同语言，但是在家务之外又找不到帮助丈夫的办法：「爱一个人却不能给他想要的东西是件悲伤的事情」，她告诉婆婆。这些不时出现的自责展示了珍妮·伍尓辛矛盾的一面。她选择探险家做丈夫，选择保有对未知世界的憧憬；但是当她真地有机会面对那个世界，她又多少因为对丈夫的关注而辜负了这场邂逅。一些女性主义学者或许会感到惋惜，如果珍妮·伍尓辛能再勇敢一点儿，她或许能对世界博物学有更大的贡献。</p><h2>04</h2><p>不管怎样，珍妮·伍尓辛证明女性完全有可能颠覆我们对博物学事业的想象。<strong>虽然她的丈夫抱怨「在队伍里带一个女人相当于带四个男人」，但是珍妮在队伍中承担着具体而关键的任务。她负责队伍的联络和财务，负责标本的整理和运输。在必要时，她像男队员一样抓蛇、打野猪、给驼队打包。弗雷德里克在接受国家地理学会的资助后开始学习摄影，他把照片冲洗和放大的任务交给了珍妮。在路上，珍妮用临时搭建的暗房冲洗了数千张底片。她还利用自己当护士的经验保障了队伍的健康。</strong>通过行医和赠药，她帮助队伍赢得了地方社会的好感，很多标本实际上来自于前来看病的农夫和猎人。这些细节都证明女性可以像男性一样影响博物学知识的生产，历史上一定有很多女性用我们不知道的方式推动了十九和二十世纪的考察。</p><p>或许，我们越是在历史上寻找女性考察者的身影和声音，就越有可能发现围绕在她们身边的规训与权力。与同时代的很多女性相比，珍妮·伍尓辛没有在从小的耳濡目染中滑向对男权政治的顺从，相反，她独特的人生轨迹和婚姻证明，这是个想要掌控自己生活的女性。但是珍妮·伍尓辛还是掉进了由丈夫制造出的漩涡：他把她带到中国，又不给她想要的中国，在矛盾中，她只能选择妥协和牺牲。珍妮·伍尔辛让我们看到了女性主体性复杂的一面。当不平等的性别实践和不公正的家庭关系塑造了女人对爱的意识，她们在想要突破时也可能撞向权力的樊笼。作为能动者的女性与作为受害者的女性之间并没有清晰的界限，看似自由的选择有可能是对权力关系的复制和确认。</p><p>我们或许可以从这种摇摆来理解珍妮·伍尓辛与边疆女性的互动。无论是在正式的社交场合还是路上的偶遇，珍妮特别喜欢在信里讲述这些互动。在谈到藏族女孩儿如何调侃弗雷德里克的相貌时，她说她们「美丽」而「直接」。在谈到自己如何与蒙古女性交流对首饰、针线包和辫子的看法时，她说这是「所有女人的共同语言」。珍妮·伍尓辛无疑对女性的共同身份有一种模糊的自觉，这也解释了她为什么非常在意中国女性的烟瘾、缠足、恶劣的衞生条件，以及年长女性与年轻女性之间的等级关系。像后殖民研究者指出的，在海外旅行的白人女性比男性更容易注意到不平等的社会制度如何限制了当地女性的发展。但是我们不知道当珍妮·伍尓辛哀叹中国边疆女性的境遇时，她是否通过把自己放到一个观察者的位置，暂时忘记了类似的权力机制也通过不平等的婚姻关系限制了她这个白人女性的自由。</p><p>珍妮·伍尓辛的故事突出了性别不平等对理解殖民世界的意义。受后殖民思潮的影响，当学者们批判西方殖民者如何用强势话语屏蔽底层的声音时，他们往往忽略了在统治者内部同样存在着分化。任何想要从性别角度批判殖民主义的学者，都需要意识到白人女性同样有可能像土著女性那样在殖民体系里处于受害者的位置。欧洲女性在很长一段时间被剥夺了进出殖民地的自由。在可以参与对殖民地的建设后，她们也被归入殖民秩序最糟糕的一面，仿佛在没有她们干扰的情况下，男性殖民者可以更好地达成与地方社会的和解，实现殖民势力作为启蒙者的一面。与同时代的很多女性相比，珍妮·伍尓辛无疑拥有更大的自由。但是当她拥有的阶层优势在万里之外的中国被稀释时，她让我们更清楚地看到即使是出身上层的女孩儿，在作为单独个体时也要屈从于男性主导的婚姻关系。</p><h2><strong>最新文章（持续更新）</strong></h2><ol

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<blockquote><h3><strong>哈马斯杀平民对自己的好处是什么？</strong></h3></blockquote><p>​@王*海</p><p>如果哈马斯真的想打完江山，坐江山的话，对于平民，外国公民来说哈马斯应该秋毫无犯的，他需要国际社会的承认，支持。</p><p></p><p>@Spring*</p><p>哈马斯攻击平民的目的是通过杀死平民，制造以色列社会混乱，增加以色列维持现状的统治成本。让以色列意识到如果继续维持现状是「亏」的，从未主动尝试完全或部分满足哈马斯的要求。攻击外国人也是同理，外国人会给以色列带来外交和旅游业上的压力。（当然我认为哈马斯这样做可能并不成功，他们的诉求过于激进反而导致以色列不会退让）综上，屠杀并不是单纯的报复，核心目的在于制造以色列的社会动荡和恐慌。</p><p></p><p>@Je*</p><ol><li><p>哈马斯不是一个精密的仪器。最底层的造成屠杀的武装人员和哈马斯作为一个组织完全是两个群体。政治目标比较明确的哈马斯领导和可能一心想要报仇的武装人员出现不一致应该是可以理解的。而且音乐节是临时选择了边界附近作为地点（wiki 上有），应该是上层领导没有预料到的。</p></li><li><p>哈马斯方面对于这个屠杀的解释也一直在变。先是说是士兵，又说是加沙民众自发屠杀，之后又改口称根本没有大屠杀。哈马斯对于这个的回应不像是提前预计好了的。</p></li></ol><p>由此，我认为音乐节屠杀更有可能是基层武装人员暴走的结果。完善的现代国家的士兵是否能在战争中遵守国际法尚且存疑，那哈马斯这样的运动没有能力约束其士兵在军事行动中的战争罪行为应该是合理的。</p><p></p><p>@这*</p><p>要引起国际社会对巴以问题的关注，从结果来看，他们达到了。哈马斯这次是抱着最后一次的想法搞得这个行动，上去的都是哈马斯的精锐，去的时候也没打算回来，这次之后也打算撤出加沙。</p><p></p><p>@薛定谔*</p><p>我在这里再做一个对问题本身的疑问。在整体的 10.7 日行动中，我们可以看到哈马斯是相对有过准备和充分训练的。比如第一波火箭弹和步兵的配合，工兵对边境墙的破障，滑翔伞部队等等。基于这样的假设，我认为哈马斯对自己行动可能产生的国际社会反应是有预计的。因此在这里，我想反过来问：杀死或不杀死在音乐节现场的他国平民，真的会有什么影响吗？或者说，在（从他们的视角看来）受到长期封锁和国际无视的前提下，一次上千人规模都袭击真的有可能只是为了引起国际关注吗？国际观瞻对他们来说有何意义。在这个基础上再进一步，袭击音乐会是一个媒体事件，和大多数国家核心利益无关，本身也很难影响国家层面在巴以问题上的站队。</p><p></p><p>@总有事*</p><p>可是哈马斯做的不仅仅是杀死平民，他还把遇难者绑在皮卡上游街示众，将杀害遇难者的流程拍下来发给他们的亲人（Soon after the attack, a video began circulating widely on social media, showing the body of a young woman being paraded through the streets in the back of a flatbed truck, surrounded by armed fighters and others yelling "Allahu Akbar" . )&nbsp;</p><p>相关链接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

也可以，但它们的运作逻辑，诉求完全不同。而哈马斯和以上这些组织也相当不同，至少在我了解范围内，他们承担了一部分加沙的基层治理工作，本身也作为政党参加了巴勒斯坦的选举。简单来说，抵达「哈马斯是/不是恐怖分子」只是一个起点。有很多问题值得问。不要止步于概念本身。</p><p></p><p>@天空*下</p><p>我粗略地想，只要是不尊重人生命的，就不为国际所容，而形态不限于恐怖主义，缅甸军政府镇压人民。似乎恐怖主义指在和平社会内部制造袭击，哈马斯这是对外残杀对内高压统治，也许不太一样。但总之，我觉得哈马斯被国际社会视为敌人没问题。</p><p></p><p>@Ada *</p><p>以下摘自百度百科：哈马斯是巴勒斯坦一个宗教性的政治组织，反对同以色列和谈，并且不放弃以武力消灭以色列，并将巴勒斯坦人对以色列的攻击行动称为「圣战」，从而建立由地中海到约旦河西岸、并以耶路撒冷为首都的巴勒斯坦国。值得注意的是哈马斯有自己的宗教性，哈马斯作为非常极端的组织的主要目标就是「将以色列清除」。他们极有可能将所有非本教的民众认为是「异教徒」，进而将暴力行为正当化为所谓「圣战」，那么从这个角度讲无条件不分国籍伤害平民也就有了一定依据。</p><p></p><p>@这*</p><p>抵抗组织的关键在于抵抗，如果没有压迫就没有抵抗，如果以色列没有压迫巴勒斯坦斯坦，哈马斯会不会继续攻击以色列，这就是他是不是抵抗组织的关键。至少哈马斯的

[10] Essentially, for Israel to legitimately makes the claim of self-defense, it must legally ensure the right to self-determination to Palestinian people, by treating Palestine as a separate, sovereign state; in this case, however, Israel is both illegally occupying Palestinian territories such as Gaza and violating Palestinian rights that are guaranteed by ICJ precedent such as Military and Paramilitary Activities.

                <![CDATA[<p>昨晚睡得早，不到 9 点就上床睡觉了。半夜 11 点多被尿憋醒，看到一道强烈的白光透过窗户射入我住的房间，闪了一下，就熄灭了。我潜意识里觉得那不是厨房的灯光，角度不对；也不是厨房旁边那个小屋子的灯光，颜色不对；因此肯定是有人站在厨房旁边那间敞开门窗的小屋子前面，用手电筒照我住的屋子。那一刻，照理说我应该感到害怕，然而我还是泰然自若地从床上爬起来，迷迷糊糊地走到院子里去上厕所。回屋的时候还在想，没准刚才用手电筒照我屋子的人此刻就藏在那间小屋里……管他呢，反正屋里的东西不值钱。我自己呢，又丑又老又矬，如果碰到劫色的，指不定是谁吃亏呢。</p><p>回到屋里躺在床上，怎么都睡不着。几只猫老是想压着被子边缘睡觉，或者压着我的脚睡觉，被子绷得紧紧的，挤压得我胸口疼，让我担心自己会不会突发心脏病，像李克强那样意外死去。于是只好不断地把猫儿们从被子上抖下去。</p><p>感觉这样迷迷瞪瞪的半失眠状态持续了很久，我甚至听到邻居家的公鸡啼鸣，然后才再次入睡。</p><p>睡着之后，我做了两个梦。</p><p>在第一个梦中，我回到故乡，和母亲以及早在 1980 年代初就已去世的祖母准备参加一场寿宴。非常奇怪的是，我们家的男性——父亲以及在 1980 年代末去世的祖父——都没有在梦中出现。寿宴的主人跟我们家似乎并非密切的亲友，只是因为我家欠了她一个人情，接到邀请后不好不去。一开始母亲只打算和祖母一起参加，需要随礼 600 元，如果我也要去，就得再加 200 元。母亲有点舍不得多花那 200 块，偏偏平常不喜欢走亲戚的我，这一次特别想去看热闹。她还在犹豫，我的干女儿不知道从哪里冒出来，说要代我随那 200 块的礼，搞得我和母亲都不好意思，母亲抹不开面子，只好带上我。祖母一声不吭地站在屋里，穿上一条裤脚开敞的白色裤子，有点像 1980 年代的喇叭裤。我笑她穿那裤子好不滑稽，母亲却向我使眼色，让我不要笑话祖母。</p><p>来到镇上举办寿宴的饭庄，却发现里面冷冷清清，并没有多少人。主人解释说应邀参加的客人比较少，原来预订的桌位退掉了好多。不过宴席上的饭菜依然丰盛，在现实生活中因为炊具尚未购全每日靠喝果汁和玉米小米糊糊和挂面维持生存的我，在梦中大吃了一顿。</p><p>我正抱着一大坨鸡肉啃呢，忽然听到外面一阵喧哗。我的干女儿告诉我们说战争爆发了，有一支军队侵入了我们所在的镇子。大家群情激愤，纷纷表示要和敌人战斗到底。</p><p>但是我们这一方的战斗力不够强，很快就被敌人打得节节败退，退守到母亲娘家所在的村子，敌人却占据了村子上方关隘处原本只有一个家族两三户人家的小村。敌人在地势上居高临下，我们处于非常不利的位置，而且部队还带着一大群由老弱妇孺组成的平民，困守在据点中，与敌人对抗了两三天，根本无法阻挡敌军顺着村子上面那条公路推进。</p><p>我心急如焚，跑到据点外查看敌军动向，却被上方公路上巡逻的敌军中一个站在车顶上窥视我军阵地的敌人发现，就在敌人举枪瞄准我的时候，我赶紧闪到一堵墙后，才躲过了枪子儿。</p><p>回到据点里，我问指挥官是否还能抽出兵力偷袭敌军营地，搞他个声东击西。指挥官摇摇头说我们的士兵已经所剩无几，根本抽不出兵力偷袭，现在只能勉强牵制住敌军火力，掩护据点里的平民疏散。</p><p>我准备带着母亲躲到下面一个废弃的村子里去。那个地方曾经出现在我以前做的一个梦中，村里房屋的地面建筑已经倒塌，到处是断壁残垣，但地下室依然坚固，可以供我们躲藏几天。</p><p>我和母亲慌乱地收拾行李，一会儿忘记带睡袋了，又或者是忘记带食物了。匆忙离开据点后，我又想起没有带换洗的内衣裤。其实带了也没用，那个废墟里根本找不到水来洗衣服。</p><p>周围都是流离失所的难民，大家各自四处逃命，能不能躲过这一劫只能看运气了。</p><p>刚离开据点没多久，我和母亲就遇到了尾随而至的敌军。他们不知道从哪里偷了一辆黑色轿车，在一个非 T 形的三岔路口截住我们。车子从上面那条倾斜的坡道，拐过一个别针弯，朝位于下方公路上的我驶来，我赶紧跨过分隔两条道路的绿化带，跑到上面那条公路上。等敌人掉转车头，顺着上面那条公路追赶我时，我又跨过那条绿化带，跑到下面的公路上来。几个回合之后，敌人恼羞成怒，举起枪就朝我来了一梭子。</p><p>按照常理，此刻的我应该已经被打成筛子，必死无疑了。但作为梦的主人，我在自己的梦中是不会死的。中枪之后，我的身体里没有流出鲜血，却喷出火来。我母亲不知道从哪里弄到一根绳子，冲到敌人跟前，想要将敌人勒死，而我也准备用身体里喷出来的火将敌人烧死。面对这两个手无寸铁却负隅顽抗的女人，敌人居然有些怯懦了。</p><p>就在这时，我从睡梦中醒来，拿起手机看了看时间，已经是早上 7 点多，我在床上睡了差不多 11 个小时。</p><p>房子对面的山上，太阳就快出来了，可是梦中那场战争在我心里留下的阴影，依然没有完全散去。</p><p>昨晚临睡之前读一本有关本地地名的书，才知道这个位于深山老林的偏远小县，在历史上有很多居民都是来自外省的移民，为躲避战乱而来到这里，有几个比较富有的家族甚至是从安徽和湖北迁徙而来的。但这些移民的主体似乎来自西南省份，无论是他们的方言还是房屋构造乃至饮食习惯，都跟我老家非常接近。</p><p>原来我并非第一个为躲避（潜在）战乱而逃进这个深山老林的人。</p>

Hall 1976）<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://matters.news/@VXNlcjoxMTAx/%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81-%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E8%88%87%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E9%96%93%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E5%A0%B4holiday-romance-bafybeifin2costmqxbvmdkmnjokmgwuzxe3s4ali4t26w5v4mq7jblmx5m#_ftn1">[1]</a>。艺术展演作品在这个过程中担当著重要的角色，它们不仅反映并形塑了一个社会城市的面貌，也在其中隐含了丰富的讨论空间。这样的作品呈现在不同的历史背景和文化政策下，对于作品的研究性和探讨意义变得更为重要。</p><p><strong>80 年代的国际视野</strong></p><p>以探讨香港与台湾剧场交流历史为例，80 年代初的香港「进念‧二十面体」（简称「进念」）在台湾的演出具有重要意义。这次两地交流不仅标志著进念首次离港演出，同时也开启了台湾邀请香港团体参与艺术节的新时代。借由 1982 年台湾新象<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://matters.news/@VXNlcjoxMTAx/%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81-%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E8%88%87%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E9%96%93%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E5%A0%B4holiday-romance-bafybeifin2costmqxbvmdkmnjokmgwuzxe3s4ali4t26w5v4mq7jblmx5m#_ftn2">[2]</a>举办的国际艺术节，进念带来了由林奕华、王庆锵、区雪儿等成员共同创作的《中国旅程之五》以及由王守谦导演的《龙舞》两出重要的演出。1984 年，进念再度受邀在台湾演出，同期演出荣念曾导演的《百年之孤寂第二年 - 往事与流言》以及何秀萍导演的《列女传 (国语版) - 三个女人的一只话》。</p><p>进念的表演强调开放的非敍事性讨论，融入禁忌、性别、身份认同和社会安全等议题，思辩结构和美学风格在台湾剧场界仍然产生深远影响，彰显了艺术作品跨越国界的力量。文化交流不仅限于作品本身，讨论也是其中重要的一环。进念在演出之外举办座谈会和工作坊，将作品的主题、背景以及编导的想法引导到更广泛的讨论中。这种积极的互动形式促使观众参与、探究，同时也加深了文化交流的意义。进念的作品在跨文化交流中展现了香港剧场的前衞艺术，并在这个过程中深化了对社会议题、身份认同等议题的探讨，尽管当时的进念只是一个刚成立的香港艺术团体，但他们已展现出一定程度的成熟和深度。</p><p>在进念打开了香港和台湾两地文化交流之门后，1988 年屏风表演班<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://matters.news/@VXNlcjoxMTAx/%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81-%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E8%88%87%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E9%96%93%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E5%A0%B4holiday-romance-bafybeifin2costmqxbvmdkmnjokmgwuzxe3s4ali4t26w5v4mq7jblmx5m#_ftn3">[3]</a>创办人李国修邀请进念再到台湾于国立台湾艺术教育馆上演《拾月／拾日谭》，紧密的互动交流，可以说是两地最激情的岁月，正如国立台北艺术大学教授钟明德所言，进念‧二十面体对于 80 年代台湾小剧场影响之大，甚至令当时的艺术新一代创作人也以进念风格创立艺团创作。而当中的推动者荣念曾的工作特别有价值，正值这两个城市发展迅速，艺术家和政策制定者需要更好地合作，以应对城市变化带来的挑战。荣念曾曾提到了他在台湾的经验，特别是他与音乐家陈郁秀分享了如何帮助台湾的艺术家建立了更多的国际联系，并帮助他们理解国际艺术界的最新动态[4]。这种跨足国际的角色使荣念曾成为台湾艺术界的一个关键人物，同时也让台湾艺术家有机会参与国际艺术交流。荣念曾一直关注艺术如何在城市中运作，以及城市如何影响艺术。他强调了艺术家和政策制定者之间的对话和互动的重要性，这种对话可以帮助艺术家更好地理解城市的需求，同时也可以让政策制定者更好地理解艺术的价值。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/e6be2518-f760-48d6-86c8-73c120e67558.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>《酷战纪事 II(台湾版)》(沙砖上，1991 年)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>90 年代的酷战剧场</strong></p><p>台湾诗人鸿鸿提到创作的起初源自于「生命的需要」，城市生活方式和需求塑造了艺术家的创作动机。他的创作概念后来转化为对「好奇心」和「乐趣」的追求，这反映了城市环境中的艺术家如何受到城市生活的启发，并进一步展现了这些城市的文化特质。鸿鸿直言 80 年代两地交流的人马中最大影响是进念，而到了 90 年代可能是《沙砖上》了[5]。</p><p>《沙砖上》成立于 1989 年，创团人物为陈炳钊、张达明与郑绮钗。上文提及进念首次在台演出时，虽然只是「新创」艺团，但其表现已具有一定程度的成熟，创作目标也清晰明确。而沙砖上则可以称为一卷龙卷风复把风沙吹起，所到之处定必满目疮痍。沙砖上剧团成立于 80 年代末 90 年代初，正值香港政治、经济、社会和文化急剧变化的时期，作品反映了年轻一代在面对时代变革时的思考、错乱和情感。沙砖上成员属于自由组织形式，张达明形容为一种「合作社的关系」。剧团的成员并没有一个固定的艺术路向或核心架构，而是持续进行实验。这种自由的探索和创新精神成为了他们的标志，使他们能够尝试不同的艺术形式和表现方式。沙砖上剧团的创团作品《蜕变》，强调作品的独特性和对当时年轻一代观众的吸引力。这些作品的内容和形式被描述为充满时代性和实验性，并且吸引了对文化和社会议题感兴趣的观众。</p><p>1989 年英国 Brith Gof<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://matters.news/@VXNlcjoxMTAx/%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81-%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E8%88%87%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E9%96%93%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E5%A0%B4holiday-romance-bafybeifin2costmqxbvmdkmnjokmgwuzxe3s4ali4t26w5v4mq7jblmx5m#_ftn6">[6]</a>剧团来港与沙砖上共同排练《酷战纪事》，于城市当代舞蹈团的城市剧场首演，演出贯彻了沙砖上的狂野，将沙、火、水、竹竿与呐喊一一于剧场内震荡。一年后这卷风沙直吹台北，1991 年台北皇冠小剧场<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://matters.news/@VXNlcjoxMTAx/%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81-%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E8%88%87%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E9%96%93%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E5%A0%B4holiday-romance-bafybeifin2costmqxbvmdkmnjokmgwuzxe3s4ali4t26w5v4mq7jblmx5m#_ftn7">[7]</a>邀请沙砖上演出《酷战纪事 II》。据陈炳钊忆述《酷战纪事》香港首演时 Brith Gof 剧团作为导师与沙砖上共同创作，但其引导成份较大[8]，而《酷战纪事 II》台湾版时，沙砖上的成员并没有专注于一年前的排练内容，因为时间已不一样，未能反应出当下的情绪与反应，所以重组与重构内容是他们的需要，最后《酷战纪事 II》来到皇冠小剧场同样是将水与火带来演出，甚至将水喷向观众。他们从集体创作的概念，到使用剧场的方式都跟当时的台湾小剧场不一样，观众从没有想过这么使用皇冠小剧场。沙砖将「剧场」本体以「空间」概念里里外外地使用，把整个剧场改造，这种作法就非常颠覆了台湾创作人及观众对演出的想法。</p><p>是次交流可称为沙砖上成员最强烈的集体回忆，文化评论人小西形容沙砖上的成员为「物以类聚，族以群分」，是一群尚在创作路上摸索艺术方向「志同道合」的青春凶猛动物[9]。《酷战纪事 II》台北交流之行为期一星期，以现今的文化交流演出筹办基准中，可以称得上是不合格的团体。演员约 6-7 人，但随行人数多达 20 多人，成员们的热情大于准备，也没有清晰的岗位工作，随著不同的错误乱行乱撞，却成为了「沙砖上」一次最深刻的交流体验，例如香港准备了的大量纸箱作为布景，但航空公司未能接受随行登机，于是到步后同行众人立即四出寻找纸箱；透过皇冠小剧场的剧团人员转介友人，团员可暂住一所时装店内，众人挤在一起起居饮食；因演出尾段演员的情绪直达崩溃式歇斯底里跑动，推倒纸箱后滑倒受伤需送院治理，这一切一切都是那个年代、那个时刻沙砖上追求的自由与疯狂。</p><p><strong>短暂的关系</strong></p><p>艺术交流就像一段短暂而美好的关系，它们需要在有限的时间内相遇、展示、沟通，以及克服各种现实面上的技术制作挑战和未知数。剧场不仅是艺术展演的场所，还是文化交流的平台，艺术文化管理者必须思考主办方和艺术家之间的关系，以及展演作品如何反映和塑造城市的多样性和深刻议题。文化交流就像一场充满新鲜感的「假日浪漫」，特别是在香港和台湾之间的剧场交流历史中，我们见证了跨足台湾舞台的香港艺术家，以及台湾对外邀请国际团体参与艺术节的崭新方向。</p><p>进念‧二十面体和沙砖上剧团的作品不仅打破了语言和文化的界限，还深入讨论了禁忌、性别、身份认同和社会议题，激发观众的思考和参与，展现了艺术的前衞力量。同时，这些交流也深刻影响了台湾小剧场的创作方式和观众期望，引领了城市文化的发展。</p><p>文化交流不仅仅关乎作品本身，还包括艺术家、政策制定者和观众之间的讨论和互动。这些对话帮助艺术更好地反映城市需求，同时让城市更了解艺术的价值。最终，文化交流丰富了城市的多元性和文化面貌，帮助我们更深入地理解城市的本质和未来。这是一场充满挑战和奇遇的冒险，也是城市和城市之间难以忘怀的假日浪漫。即使在既定的演出之外，它依然能够意想不到地影响并改变城市的面貌，因为城市的脚步永不停止，文化交流的力量永远持续著。<br class="smart"></p><p>「港台两地早期小剧场交流史（1980-90 年代）」系列 (1)</p><p></p><p><strong>注释</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://matters.news/@VXNlcjoxMTAx/%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81-%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E8%88%87%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E9%96%93%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E5%A0%B4holiday-romance-bafybeifin2costmqxbvmdkmnjokmgwuzxe3s4ali4t26w5v4mq7jblmx5m#_ftnref1">[1]</a> Culture is communication and communication is culture."&nbsp; （文化是沟通，沟通是文化。HALL Edward T.

                <![CDATA[<p>上周末去黄山一趟，参加黄山马拉松，顺便打卡一下名胜古迹。</p><p>我从未去过安微，但长期被各种图片中的皖南风光所吸引，这是黄山马之所以吸引到我目光的主要原因。不然，过去的这个周末，全中国据说有超过 20 场马拉松同时鸣枪，黄山马拉松假如没有黄山这个金字招牌，大概没几个人会关注得到。</p><p>果然，比赛不太值得一提，可能考虑到封锁道路对当地交通的影响，线路安排在交通不便，通常游客也比较少的黄山北门一带。北门所在的太平镇是黄山区政府所在地。这点比较奇怪，不是一般情况下衙门所在地都是各种中心吗？而黄山的南大门汤口镇，才是黄山景区的主要入口。那里距黄山市更近，交通更便利，接待能力也更强，据说黄山游客超过 90% 都是从南门上山。</p><p>不过，据面馆老板娘讲，北门明年就通高铁，到时就可以和汤口一争长短。</p><p>那是跑完五个半小时，从接驳车终点走回酒店的路上路过的一个面馆。我虽然被赛场上的香蕉和能量胶喂了个半饱，肚子不饿，但每次完赛去往酒店的路上，都是一天中最难熬的时光，堪比整个 42.195K。所以我一般只要途中有饭馆，就会停下来歇脚，顺便吃饭，暂且不管满身狼狈。</p><p>老板娘推荐笋干面加牛肉，我说好，再来瓶迎客松。那是当地啤酒品牌，酒精度只有 2.5 度。老板娘在里间煮面时，从外面进来一个三十多岁的阴郁男子，径自走到冰柜，拿了瓶啤酒，在操作间外面的桌子上坐下来，和我之间有几张桌子。我和老板娘隔着玻璃隔断聊马拉松时，他一边刷抖音一边对瓶吹，始终没看我一眼，也未插一言。但有次突然擤鼻涕，直接冲着地面，像是马打了个响鼻。擤完也没起身洗手，甚至没用纸擦一擦，继续刷他的抖音。我心里一沉，转念安慰自己，反正也不是他煮的，他看起来连厨房也不会进。然后，他就进了厨房。那时，正好有人打电话，老板娘走到外边来接电话，他便在里边代替她。看动作，像是捞面。我几乎眼前一黑，想要拔腿就跑。可是跑不动，也不知道怎么跑。于是继续假装无事发生（这是中国人最在行的技能）。好在，他后来给自己端了一碗出来吃，我那碗，是再后来老板娘端出来的。我以为我吃不下，可是几分钟后，我连汤都喝了个精光。谈不上好吃，大概是身体极度需要碳水。走时我一边跟老板娘说谢谢，一边心想，我要记住这个店，以后再也不要来了。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/932ed9c4-8e2c-4383-b929-8807c3268fe6.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>那碗面</figcaption></figure><p>不只是这家面馆，大概黄山马拉松，也就只此一次。它以城市马拉松之名，行山地马拉松之实，后来跑进山里，一些路段坡长弯急，也没什么风光可看。我本来打算跑进 5 小时，晚上奖励自己一个臭鳜鱼，结果拼尽全力也就跑了 531，臭鳜鱼便没吃到。</p><p>话说那臭鳜鱼，我在呈坎的小饭馆吃过一次，98 一条，一斤左右。以为是旅游区的原因，蛮期待到了城市再吃个便宜的。谁想在太平，马拉松前夜，那家饭馆要价 108。</p><p>就算我是个并不那么甘心随波逐流的人，也难免被大众情绪影响。那臭鳜鱼，要说多好吃，也并没有，不过就是更出名。和黄山一样。</p><p>我马拉松第二天从黄山下来后，跟朋友说，这些内陆的风景名胜，可能拜古人所见有限，如果是现在，文人墨客们能去得更远，比如川西、比如西藏和新疆，甚至甘肃和云南，大概都不会有「五岳归来不看山，黄山归来不看岳」这样的感慨吧。</p><p>我因为刚跑完马拉松，不敢逞强，选择从北门乘缆车上山。黄山给了马拉松选手免门票的待遇，但把这待遇集中到了赛后，北门原来接待能力就弱，一下子涌来几千人，于是景区观光车加上索道排队便超过俩小时。北门那太平索道，是一个大轿厢，最多可容纳 100 人，单向行驶，上去后再下来，才轮到下一波。缆车像高峰期的公交一样，挤得水泻不通。一些变坡点，又像海盗船一样摇来晃去，惹得惊叫连连。景区心真大，乘客心也大。但乘客像社会系统里的普通民众，只能随波逐流。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/e9ec9984-af47-48fc-86aa-0fc132b58c6c.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>缆车的轿厢</figcaption></figure><p>我本来想，赛后先去西递和宏村，给腿脚个休息缓冲的余地。可是北门这里的交通系统，远比我想像中落后，一去一来非常不便。加之跑完自我感觉好于预期，最终还是先上了山。计划上下都乘缆车的。从太平索道终点爬到迎客松后，又觉得尚有余力步行下山。于是便步行下山。假如不是马拉松，以我的习惯和性格，上山也必定要爬之而后快。如果说这次黄山之行留下什么遗憾，那便是没登莲花峰。莲花峰是黄山之巅，「主峰突兀，小峰簇拥，俨若新莲初开，仰天怒放「（百度百科语）。这次不是吹牛，我站在峰底仰望，看到游客的身影在另人肃然起敬的高处拾级而上，也禁不住心驰神往。但我腿疼，时间也不允许，只能望峰兴叹。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ed59d8f8-2b54-4733-91e9-8879f88706b8.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>你得仔细，才能看到莲花峰上的人影</figcaption></figure><p>下行路上，看到天都峰，为莲花峰、光明顶之外的黄山第三主峰，和莲花峰一样高耸险峻，不过上山的梯步封锁，无人身处其中。莲花峰和天都峰轮休，现在正是天都峰的休养生息期。明年 4 月，它将出关面对游客。相应的，莲花峰那时将接替它进入为期五年的休养期。</p><p>做为爬山爱好者来讲，想一次登完这两座高峰，看来是不可能了。而这两座黄山的门面，咫尺天涯，只能遥遥相望，无法执手相看。</p><p>在光明顶决定步行下山，斥十元巨资买了根烤肠补充能量，没吃两口，啪，掉地上了。好气呀。想起小时候，门口来了卖冰棍的，我姐买了两根，给我一根，我们站在门楼的阴影里吃冰棍。也是没嗦两口，啪，在泥地上摔得粉碎。不知道为什么后来这件事成了不断回到我脑海中的记忆片段之一。但那记忆会分岔，有时候是我姐看我包起了眼泪花花，马上又买了一根给我。另外一些时候，她斥责我不拿好，我恼羞成怒，骂骂咧咧比她还凶。那时候冰棍三分钱一根，放在一个包着棉套子的箱子里，阳光炽烈，那箱子架在货郎的自行车后座，走村串乡」，冰棍……冰棍……「</p><p>光明顶下山步道起点那里有个告示：步行下山 6.5 公里，需要 2.5 小时。我问卖烤肠的大叔，路不好吗怎么 6.5 公里需要那么久？他说，反正抬滑杆的半个小时就到，你自己考量你的能力。我说那我知道了，我加一倍一个小时总能到的。实际花了一个半小时，路上很多一瘸一拐的」马后炮「。我揹包很重，电脑装在里面，随时准备处理工作事务，越走膝盖越疼，平路上颤颤巍巍。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/3b0d30bd-3de3-4139-bedc-253e2128341e.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>」忸怩作态「的马后炮们</figcaption></figure><p>路遇一位大叔，他也昨天跑了全马，今天步行上山，又步行下山。他刚退休，下周末还要跑横店。我真羡慕他，其码不用背电脑。他说但是工资少了一半，我说钱哪儿能挣完。</p><p>晚上住在黄山南大门的汤山岭，酒店的大床，是两个小床拼就。我发了个动态，说这真离谱，能睡五个人。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/64d149f1-c386-475b-9108-75bc586f67cd.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>挑夫</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/132e7cfe-20e5-4e90-9e39-81e8a1e8cab3.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>黄山松</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b5ea1749-37a5-46a3-a2c9-a8e678d534fd.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>仙人指路</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/80014b65-958f-4ae1-bf0d-ad90e69a3066.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>山路</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/3d10dc39-cc5b-410f-b8a7-52e807a4a6f3.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>远眺</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/4680863e-6a8b-4fb3-bb3e-62010e674fc1.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>黄山松</figcaption></figure><p></p>

王菁</p><p></p><h2><strong>01.&nbsp;记录先知的生平&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>1995 年，穆罕默德·阿克拉姆·纳德维在牛津大学伊斯兰研究中心做研究。当时，《纽约时报》称穆斯林女性受教育程度低是因为伊斯兰。为此而感到愤怒的他决定采取行动。他开始到古代阿拉伯抄本中搜寻女人的名字，特别是女学者的名字。</p><p>起初，他希望找出大概二三十人。但是，他说：「不久之后我意识到，在求知路上，活跃着大量的女人。有学者写到，‘我和 70 个女人一起学习’。还有学者转述 400 个女人转述过的圣训。」</p><p>对许多穆斯林来说，圣训是古兰之下第二重要的材料。圣训是写下来的，关于先知穆罕默德生平的记录，即据说，他说过、做过什么。圣训对穆斯林来说极其重要，因为它们把古兰的抽象信息转化为日常细节。在伊斯兰早期，致力于确定圣训真实性的穆斯林学者批判地处理其原始资料。</p><p>纳德维先是到圣训集中搜寻女人的名字，那些圣训集或众所周知，或不那么为人所知。他还深入考察了学者写的关于其老师（无论男女）的传记和报告。他的发现超出了他所有的预期。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/8adca59d-210b-412d-9988-8786d5bfb377.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>二十年来，纳德维一直致力于把被历史埋没的女学者抢救出来。但他并非人们通常所说的自由主义穆斯林。他也不自诩女性主义者。纳德维承认，「但女性主义和我在一点上是一致的。我的确相信女人一直被压迫，我们应该努力捍衞她们的权利，给她们应有的荣誉。」</p><p>于是，他一开始写的文章变成一本书，书又变成了百科全书。2021 年 1 月中旬，在二十多年的努力后，他终于完成了他的工作。如今，超过一万个女人的传记，被收入了一套一共 43 卷的百科全书。这个最终结果甚至让在德国明斯特大学做研究的伊斯兰教义学家迪娜·奥马里（Dina El Omari）吃惊。「我意识到有很多[女学者]，但事实证明竟然有这么多，这令人震惊——的确，这让整个研究变得更激动人心了。」</p><p>纳德维也有一些激动人心的故事要讲。以 7 世纪大马士革的著名法学者乌姆·达尔（Umm al-Darda）为例。年轻时，她不但和男人一起学习，还和他们一起在清真寺里，在男人礼拜的区域礼拜——这在今天的大多数清真寺里都是不可想象的。还有生活在 11 世纪的麦加的卡里玛·马尔瓦奇亚（Karima al-Marwaziyya）。她抄录的最重要的圣训集——《布哈里圣训集》——到今天都还被认为是最完整可靠的。</p><p>纳德维估计，大约有四分之一的圣训是女人传下来的。而且，显然，这些女人不但勤勉，而且缜密。「在涉及先知言行的时候，很多、很多男人被指控编造圣训。但所有圣训学者都确认，从来没有一个女人在任何一条圣训上撒谎，这是非常了不起的。」</p><p></p><h2><strong>02.&nbsp;男人出名，女人则被埋没&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>可如果有这么多博学的女穆斯林，且她们又是如此地勤勉认真，那么，为什么在她们之中，今天被人们记住的又如此之少呢？纳德维用这样一个例子来加以解释：</p><p>「伊斯兰的伟大学者之一，生活在 13 或 14 世纪的伊本·萨玛尼（Ibn al-Sam’ani）记录说，他曾经想和一个名叫卡里玛的女人一起学习：‘我多次请求她兄弟允许我和她一起学习。但她兄弟总能找到理由不让。’在这里，你可以看到问题之所在：人们想让自己的儿子或兄弟出名，把自己的姐妹藏起来。」</p><p>纳德维竭力抢救这些被历史埋没的女人。但他并非人们所说的自由主义穆斯林。纳德维一直和欧洲的 Fatwarat（德国的教法委员会）有合作，后者和穆斯林兄弟会有联系。他也不认为自己是女性主义者。</p><p>「但女性主义和我在一点上是一致的」，纳德维承认，「我的确相信女人一直被压迫，我们应该努力捍衞她们的权利，给她们应有的荣誉。我不喜欢的是那种在男人和女人之间划等号的女性主义。」</p><figure class="image"><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>最终成果的尝鲜：这本书是纳德维四十卷女圣训学者传记词典[阿语]的前言。在伊斯兰的形成时期，博学的女人享有很高的公共地位和权威。数个世纪以来，女人为宗教知识而大量地游学并经常造访伊斯兰世界最著名的清真寺和经学院。这个附有地图的概论章节追溯了女性圣训学习中心的传播及其最终的衰落。</p><h2><strong>03.&nbsp;以传统的名义进行阻挠&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>不过，他的作品对女穆斯林来说依然重要，因为它为她们提供了在争取更多话语权时可以使用的令人信服的论证。毕竟，根据格努·叶尔丽（Gönül Yerli），一些男穆斯林在试图剥夺女性权力的时候还在援引「传统」。</p><p>叶尔丽是彭茨贝格清真寺的副主任，是德国伊斯兰社群的少数女领袖之一。一开始，一些巴伐利亚教亲还不愿意接受她担任这个位置。叶尔丽还记得，「一位教亲说：‘你知道的，圣训说：如果女人担任伊斯兰共同体的领袖，那么这个共同体就会被诅咒，她也永远不得安宁。’」</p><figure class="image"><img

wadud）在纽约领拜的照片，摄影师 Don Emmert，图源 AFP</figcaption></figure><p>男人会用宗教的论证来操纵女人，这种情况对迪娜·奥马里来说也不陌生。「据说，先知有这样一条圣训是这样说的：如果男人邀请女人上床而女人拒绝的话，那么，天仙就会整夜诅咒她。当然，这是非常极端的例子了。但这的确说明女人遭到了迫害，人们利用宗教的理由来逼她们做她们不想做的事。」</p><p>根据格努·叶尔丽，为什么这些说辞会如此地常见还有另一个理由：它们比古兰更好理解。「古兰的语言是复杂的，它也不会对每一个问题给出回答。事实上，老实说，它很少会回答具体的问题。」</p><h2><strong>04.&nbsp;质疑圣训中厌女的内容&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>格努·叶尔丽和迪娜·奥马里都试图在自己的工作、教学和对教亲的关怀中与厌女的圣训对抗。比如说，奥马里解释说，穆罕默德是不是这些情绪的事实上的发起者这点是非常不确定的。毕竟，这些厌女的圣训都没有在现存的最古老的圣训集中出现。「这点是相当值得注意的。它真会让你停下来思考：这些厌女的圣训与先知的传记形成了如此鲜明的对照，以至于它们看起来十分地不对劲。」</p><p>奥马里说，只要女人有话语权，厌女的圣训就会被纠正。比如说，在先知归真后，他最喜欢的妻子之一阿伊莎就经常和他的同伴之一艾布·胡莱赖争论。</p><figure

年，阿伊莎获得博士学位，并于当年在开罗刚成立的艾因夏姆斯大学下属的女子学院担任阿拉伯语文学教授。图源维基百科</p><p>比如说，在艾布·胡莱赖说在男人礼拜时女人在他前方走过会坏了男人的拜功「的时候，阿伊莎在起誓后明确地说先知从来没有说过那样的话」，奥马里说。</p><p>阿伊莎本人也在多条圣训中报告说，先知在自己房间礼拜的时候，就算她躺在床上正对先知，先知也照样礼拜。像这样的例子表明，最终再次关注和承认这些古代女学者是多么地重要。</p><p>纳德维也同意这点。「如果女人不能为自己说话的话，那么没人会为她们说话。然后关于女人的错误想法会流行，这样，就没人再有能力捍衞她们了。」</p><h2><strong>最新文章（持续更新）</strong></h2><ol

                <![CDATA[<p>伟大的阿根廷作家博尔赫斯葬在日内瓦。在他的墓碑上有古英语和古诺斯的碑文，还有一行令人费解的西班牙文。墓碑上所刻的内容是作家自己定的，正和他决定要葬在日内瓦而非故土一样。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ea029102-6477-4cbf-acdd-b0dd94298379.webp/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>博尔赫斯墓正面（图来自网络）</figcaption></figure><p>由于一战，博尔赫斯随父母滞留于日内瓦度，在这里度过了青少年时代，并学习了拉丁语和一些古英语，不过按他自己的标准，认为对古英语的学习非常有限。1921 年，博尔赫斯一家人回到了阿根廷。父亲买了不少书给博尔赫斯，其是就包括当时威廉·莫里斯翻译的冰岛传奇史诗萨迦。博尔赫斯也进一步掌握了古诺斯语和古英语，对冰岛史诗极为喜爱，他的作品中经便经常引用萨迦。同时他对其他古代史诗很一样着迷——《荷马史诗》，《贝奥武夫》，古爱尔兰的无名诗等等。他的短篇小说中都那些时期的诗人为主人公，如《镜子与面具》、《乌恩德尔》，讲述他们对词句准确且精妙的追求。</p><p>博尔赫斯后来和他的父亲一样，因眼疾失明，这对于一个以阅读和写作的人来说痛苦无以复加，而且失明也是从视力减退逐渐开始的，在这种痛苦中，博尔赫斯或许意识到自己面对的这种无情的命运与许多英雄诗篇中讲述斗争有相似之处。随着视力的消退，博尔赫斯越来越依赖自己原来储存的词汇，而其中大部分是欧洲中世纪的文学。他后来在大学讲授冰岛史诗和盎格鲁撒克逊诗歌以及其他英雄主题文学，来听他课的一个人便是日裔阿根廷人玛丽亚·儿玉。而从 1975 年起，她成了他余生的秘书、向导和伴侣或者说他的另一双眼睛。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f2ca6e7e-12ce-495e-a891-f94996537f60.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>博尔赫斯与玛丽亚·儿玉（图片来自网络）</figcaption></figure><p>当博尔赫斯被发现患有癌症时已是晚期，他和玛丽亚·儿玉决定结婚。由于当时阿根廷法律不允许离婚和再婚，所以二人选择去国外结婚，婚后直接去了日内瓦。在这个留下他美好记忆的地方生活了几个月后，博尔赫斯离世。</p><p>博尔赫斯的墓地选在日内瓦，而墓碑的设计却体现了一种普通人不会想到的组合。整体看上去的第一印象有点像北欧那些鲁尼文石碑。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/1f88896f-ba19-4409-8673-9dd0d44716f7.webp/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>林迪斯法恩刻有维京人入侵的石碑（图片来自网站）</figcaption></figure><p>博尔赫斯墓碑的正面有一群穿着盔甲的战士，这与英国林迪斯法恩岛现存的那块墓碑十分相似，而后者所展示的正是公元 793 年维京人过海袭击这座岛屿的情景（详情可见此处：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://matters.town/@Gyllebo/306519-%E7%BB%B4%E4%BA%AC%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%B2-%E4%BA%8C-%E5%AF%B9%E8%A5%BF%E9%83%A8%E7%9A%84%E4%BE%B5%E6%89%B0-%E4%B8%8A-bafyreigir5u4j7ppqa72jlfjtyinsfntv4mhtpcen7pci2btt73mvl2czi">https://matters.town/@Gyllebo/306519-%E7%BB%B4%E4%BA%AC%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%B2-%E4%BA%8C-%E5%AF%B9%E8%A5%BF%E9%83%A8%E7%9A%84%E4%BE%B5%E6%89%B0-%E4%B8%8A-bafyreigir5u4j7ppqa72jlfjtyinsfntv4mhtpcen7pci2btt73mvl2czi</a> ）。这一群战士浮雕上面是墓主人豪尔赫·路易斯·博尔赫斯的名字。浮雕下面有一行字，写的是「...and ne forhtedon na」这行字下面是墓主人的生卒年「1899-1986」，旁边是个凯尔特十字架。「...and ne forhtedon na」 是一句古英语，意思是「不要害怕」的意思，是从博尔赫斯翻译并经常谈及的诗歌「马尔登之战」中引用的。</p><p>关于马尔登战役也与维京人有关，公元 991 年，一队维京海盗在英格兰东南海岸的马尔登附近登陆，并遭遇当地埃尔多曼·伯特诺斯率领的队伍。维京人登陆时正逢涨潮，两军之间有一条狭窄的堤道，如果维京人继续前进，英格兰人应该很容易地打退他们。此时维京人首领，据称是后来加冕为挪威国王的奥拉夫·特里格瓦松向伯特诺斯提出一个条件，等到潮水退去，这样双方才可以打一场「公平」的仗，而英格兰人竟然同意了。在这首古英语诗歌的第 17 行，伯特诺斯对他的手说原地不动，「握紧你的盾牌」，，「不要害怕。」 从这首诗里选一句，应是博尔赫斯想对自己说的。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b4391131-e1d7-4b24-80ec-3a63275c1199.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>博尔赫斯墓碑背面（图片来自网络）</figcaption></figure><p>博尔赫斯墓碑的背面正中是一艘维京船的浮雕，应取材于瑞典哥特兰岛的一块鲁尼文石碑。维京人的传统中一向将船与死亡联系在一起：死亡是通向未知世界的最后一次伟大航行。博尔赫斯墓碑背面这艘船的上方是有一行字「Hann tekr sverthtt Gram ok leggri methal their abert」，这句话来自冰岛沃尔松加萨迦中的一行，意为「他把出鞘的剑放在他们之间。这是冰岛传说中一对名叫西古尔德和布隆希尔德的夫妇，在死后要放一把无鞘的剑在中间，表示他们会更像夫妻。</p><p>而维京船浮雕下面还有一行墓主人母语西班牙语写的「De Ulrica a Javier Otárola」，即」乌尔丽卡致哈维尔·奥塔罗拉」。乌尔丽卡和哈维尔是博尔赫斯的短篇小说《乌尔丽卡》中的两个人物，这一故事由也是冰岛传奇中一小段改编而成，讲述了一个年轻的挪威女子和老年男子之间的浪漫爱情故事。这个故事对玛丽亚有着特殊的意义，因为她和博尔赫斯之间便用乌尔丽卡和哈维尔作为只有二人知道的暱称。</p><p>一只墓碑承载了这许多的背景和线索，也许只有博尔赫斯这样的博学之人才会提前设计好，和他的一部部作品一样，总是曲径通幽，深意无限。</p><p><br class="smart"></p><p></p><p></p>
