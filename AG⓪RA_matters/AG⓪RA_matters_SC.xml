            <title>微故事: 如迷宫的大宅 (东加豆)</title>
            <description>&lt;h2&gt;微故事: 如迷宫的大宅 (东加豆)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/bfc83115-d07a-4561-bd2d-37195a81ed99.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;这是一座｛如城堡的大宅｝。阿红求得了这份｛清洁工｝之后，她每天就在这里进出进入。其实阿红不用工作的，以她现在的积蓄是足够过她的退休生活。不过，这里的人都认为，这家人是全城镇最富有的。富有到这样真叫人好奇，人们未必会羡慕他们，但总会有好奇心。就像王室里的成员一样，那些生活是不会让人向往的，但那种不寻常的视物却引人好奇和疑惑。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿红每天清晨，当第一道阳光照进来的时候，她便会踏上前往大宅的路，她拥有了自由穿梭于这座城堡的权利。虽然只不过是一个｛清洁工｝，或者说阿红只是一个清洁工。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;起初，她只是默默地扫地、擦窗，尽量不去打扰这座大宅的宁静。但随著日子一天天过去，她开始注意到一些不寻常的细节。走廊的尽头总是有风吹过，而那里明明没有开窗。楼梯转角处有几幅壁画，那些抽象画让人难以理解，不似人也不似动物，不似风景也不似食物，而且每次经过都似乎会有些变化。不仅阿红觉得这样，花王和洗熨工也这样说的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;渐渐，她觉得这座宅大得离谱，东南西北面也有建筑物一路延伸，用迷宫来形容它绝不夸张。管家说这个家庭有五十个人，但阿红却没有见多过十个人，他们进出门时间不同，吃饭时间、起床和晚睡的时间也不一样，原来两年前大老爷死了之后就变成这样。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿红她被那错综复杂的走廊迷惑，每扇门后似乎都隐藏著不为人知的秘密，她很想知道门里住著一个什么样的人，大宅住了那么多人，怎么连五个人也不会走在一起？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿红在抹擦古董和打扫无尽房间的过程中，她发现这里的每一块地砖，每一扇雕花窗户，都仿佛诉说著沉默的故事。这座大宅宁静得叫人可怕！最热闹就是佣人聚集的地方。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;有一天，阿红无意中发现了一间封闭许久的图书室，她心情带著几分惊喜和兴奋。尘封的书籍堆叠成山，她轻手轻脚地在其中漫游，仿佛每一本书都是一个世界，等著她去探索。阿红是爱书之人，爱阅读，爱写字。但从她的外表是看不出来的，因为她是妇孺，妇孺和识字仿佛是不相关的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;她发现了一本厚重皮革封面的日记，她带著冒险和偷窥的心情，坐在地上的毛毡，她把身子卷缩起来，读到了墨中人的心声。关于家族、财富以及孤独和自由的迷思。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;随著日子一天天过去，阿红与其他工人和居住者产生了微妙的互动。她注意到管家眼中的高傲背后，隐藏著对这份工作的无比自豪，而那些匆匆走过的家人们脸上的笑容背后，则是彼此之间看不见的疏远和算计。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一晚的深夜，阿红在大宅深处听到了微弱的钢琴旋律。她追随著音符的线索，找到了一间密室，里面坐著那位少爷，他的手指在琴键上灵活跃动，他眼神充满了寂寞，深不见底的寂寞就是这种人。在那刻，阿红突然明白了，这座大宅中的每个人都在上演自己的独角戏。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;皮革封面的日记原来不仅只有一本，阿红发现了十多本，半年里她已经看了好几本，可是她无法知道墨中人是谁，也无法知道是男还是女写的。这个图书室里的东西通通都是遗物，所有书籍的物主已经死去了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿红从日记里发现了很多，墨中人写尽了家族人生的悲哀！以及荒唐和淫乱的事情，讽刺的事，不仅家族的人是这样，大宅里的佣人都一样。阿红手里握著这本日记，她知道她会继续看下去的，她知道她越看得多，就会明白为什么他们一个个都躲起来...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;完&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;写作日期：2024 年 3 月 27 日&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;开始时间 : 11:15am&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;完结时间 : 15:47pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;图.文. 东加豆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;相关故事:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://matters.news/@tonkabean/343497-%E5%A6%82%E5%9F%8E%E5%A0%A1%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%A7%E5%AE%85-%E5%9C%96-%E6%96%87-%E6%9D%B1%E5%8A%A0%E8%B1%86&quot;&gt;https://matters.news/@tonkabean/343497-如城堡的大宅-图-文-东加豆&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;我除了写微故事，还制作有声书，希望我们能互相认识。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;喜欢我的文章吗？盼得到您的支持、点赞，或分享我的文章，让我知道创作的路上有你陪伴。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E8%88%87%E9%BC%93%E5%8B%B5/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/支持与鼓励/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;关于我：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;故事选集&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://matters.town/@tonkabean/collections&quot;&gt;https://matters.town/@tonkabean/collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFT 收集&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://liker.land/zh-Hant/like1cdavnkhzj8wsaeafmyqctrs9952q4hgk6tpael?tab=created&quot;&gt;https://liker.land/zh-Hant/like1cdavnkhzj8wsaeafmyqctrs9952q4hgk6tpael?tab=created&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;东加豆贴文生活 What&#39;s App Channel~~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;你的追踪, 就是我的动力.

            <title>Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit to the mainland: a valuable attempt to ease tensions in the Taiwan Strait</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; According to media reports, Ma Ying-jeou, the former leader of Taiwan (former President of the Republic of China), will visit the Mainland in April 2024, traveling to Xi&#39;an, Guangzhou and Beijing to participate in a series of activities, and may also meet with Xi Jinping, President of China and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The author had written an opinion piece commenting and praising Mr. Ma&#39;s visit to the mainland at the end of March last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The author continues to hold the same view on the latest visit to take place. Cross-Strait relations have deteriorated even more in recent year, and the recent Kinmen ship collision and subsequent clashes have emphasized the importance of cross-Strait exchanges and maintaining peace. The author also releases this article again in the hope that more people will understand the motivation and impact of Ma&#39;s visit to the mainland and promote the peaceful development of both sides of the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The following content is the original text)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 27, 2023, former leader of Taiwan (former President of the Republic of China) Ma Ying-jeou arrived in Nanjing, initiating his trip to mainland China under the guise of &quot;ancestral worship.&quot; Ma Ying-jeou is the first former president of Taiwan to visit the mainland, carrying significant symbolic weight and sparking widespread international attention and intense controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months, with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the formation and confrontation of the two major camps in the world (those supporting Ukraine&#39;s liberal democratic camp and those pro-Russia authoritarian camp), tensions in the Taiwan Strait have been escalating. Speculation about the possibility of mainland China using force against Taiwan has been rife, with various countries in the US, Japan, and Europe intervening in the Taiwan issue in different ways, leading to increasing tensions in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In such a situation, Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit to the mainland with a delegation composed of many young students has sparked even more controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, where anti-Communist and anti-mainland sentiments have dominated public opinion in recent years, most Taiwanese naturally hold a critical attitude towards Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit. They believe that, in the current highly confrontational situation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit to the mainland constitutes an act of &quot;selling out&quot; and &quot;surrender,&quot; undermining the morale of Taiwanese people who &quot;resist China and protect Taiwan.&quot; Some commentators also believe that Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit amounts to presenting a &quot;united front gift&quot; to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which could be used and flaunted by the CCP to further infiltrate and eventually occupy Taiwan. Some commentators even resort to personal attacks, alleging that Ma Ying-jeou is paving the way for personal gain, seeking &quot;rewards&quot; from the CCP, and aiming for a semi-official position under CCP rule after Taiwan falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are voices expressing understanding and appreciation for Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit to the mainland, but they are relatively few, mainly coming from Chinese officials and some Western individuals. Only a few members of the Kuomintang (KMT) in Taiwan have expressed support for this former president and party chairman. Overall, criticism outweighs praise. Among Chinese political opposition figures, criticism of Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit to the mainland is almost unanimous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a political opposition member myself, I have a relatively different assessment and hold a rather positive view of Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit to the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always had a favorable impression of Mr. Ma Ying-jeou. This is not only because his political stance aligns with mine, but also because Mr. Ma&#39;s character and morals are worthy of respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Ma Ying-jeou was one of the few political figures in Taiwan who had a strong sense of Chinese national identity, full of national sentiment, genuinely cared about mainland China and its people, and deeply hoped for the country to achieve democratic reunification. During Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s presidency, the concept of &quot;cross-strait kinship&quot; was implemented in various fields such as economy, culture, and society, leading to unprecedented closeness and friendliness between the people on both sides of the strait. Although there were still political tensions, they were able to &quot;set aside disputes and seek common development&quot; to a large extent, and the level of peace in the Taiwan Strait and cross-strait cooperation reached a historical peak during Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ma Ying-jeou also cared deeply about human rights, cultural education, and social livelihood in the mainland. Every year on the anniversary of the June 4th Incident, Mr. Ma would publish articles or posts expressing condolences to the students and people who died in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and emphasizing the necessity and importance of China&#39;s democratization. He also placed considerable importance on the education and growth of the younger generation in China and promoted exchanges and interactions between young people on both sides of the strait. During his presidency, various policies were introduced to facilitate mainland students studying in Taiwan, and cooperation between educational institutions in Taiwan and the mainland was promoted. This has greatly contributed to mutual understanding between people on both sides of the strait, especially among young people, and to the harmonious and friendly relations between the future generations of mainlanders and Taiwanese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his presidency, Ma Ying-jeou also issued a commendation to the Chinese-American writer Iris Chang, praising her for dedicating her life to writing &quot;The Rape of Nanking,&quot; which raised awareness and understanding of the Nanjing Massacre among people worldwide. This reflects Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s love for the Chinese nation, his concern for the tragic history of the mainland, and his commendation and remembrance of those who have contributed to the Chinese nation within his capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s active decades in Taiwan, whether as Chiang Ching-kuo&#39;s secretary, later as president, or as a civilian after stepping down from leadership, he maintained excellent moral qualities and noble character. Compared to other Taiwanese politicians plagued by scandals, Ma Ying-jeou is one of the few politicians with almost no blemishes, known for his integrity, approachability, and elegant speech. He can be considered a perfect man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Ma Ying-jeou is a person who sincerely loves the Chinese nation, genuinely hopes for democratic reunification of China, and possesses high moral character. Such a person would not sell himself out or kneel before others for fame and fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ma Ying-jeou chose the current timing to visit the mainland in the hope of making the utmost effort to promote cross-strait peace and exchanges, reduce unnecessary hostility and miscalculations, and defuse another Taiwan Strait crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this visit, Ma Ying-jeou repeatedly reminded the Tsai Ing-wen government in Taiwan to avoid escalating conflicts with the mainland as much as possible. However, in the tense cross-strait relations and the firm &quot;resist China and protect Taiwan&quot; policy of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government, Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s appeals had little effect. Nevertheless, Ma Ying-jeou has not given up on advocating for peace. His decision to visit the mainland this time was made after careful consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the first former Taiwanese leader to visit the mainland, Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit should have been of extraordinary significance and deserved a grand reception. However, upon his arrival in Nanjing on the 27th, he was only welcomed by a deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and the welcoming ceremony was quite simple, indicating a lack of enthusiasm from mainland China towards Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit. This reflects the awkward position Ma Ying-jeou finds himself in, trying to please both sides. However, this was likely something Ma Ying-jeou anticipated before his visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Ma Ying-jeou resolutely embarked on his journey to the mainland, further proving his sincere commitment to promoting cross-strait peace and exchanges, regardless of personal gain or loss. His decision to lead dozens of young students to the mainland also reflects his consistent emphasis on education, nurturing new talents, and promoting exchanges between young people on both sides of the strait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, in the current context of the Taiwan Strait and international situation, as well as the relatively unfavorable political climate on both sides of the strait, Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit is unlikely to change the reality and will have a very limited impact. However, it makes Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit even more rare and valuable, reflecting that even in the current precarious cross-strait and international situation, there are still people trying to facilitate communication and easing tensions to cool down the situation. This is not easy and deserves respect and appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a writer from mainland China, I, like Ma Ying-jeou, also support the reunification of both sides based on democracy. Of course, regardless of the system, national reunification should respect the will of the majority of people on both sides, and should not be achieved through force. If war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, it will only bring suffering to the people and is entirely unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan, although upholding freedom and democracy, does not care about the people of mainland China and has no intention of promoting democracy in mainland China. They only hope to maintain the status quo of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. This is a narrow-minded stance. Moreover, if the mainland remains under CCP dictatorship, with its people brainwashed and manipulated, true peace in the Taiwan Strait is unlikely, and democratic Taiwan will always face the threat of authoritarian China under the CCP. Therefore, only when mainland China also achieves democracy, with both sides adhering to universal values, can peace be truly enduring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author hopes that Taiwan will have more people who, like Mr. Ma Ying-jeou, firmly believe in the universal values of freedom and democracy while also caring for mainland compatriots and being concerned about the suffering of over a billion people on the more than 9 million square kilometers of territory still nominally part of the Republic of China. They should strive to promote democratization and political pluralism throughout China, achieve the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, promote peace in the Asia-Pacific region, and contribute to global prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h2&gt;微故事: 艺术家的郁金香 (东加豆)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/938399df-e493-4f16-bfe5-8beaad9f6040.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;拍摄:泳友-阿伍-Simon Ng&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;国家博物馆的中央放了一块巨大的画布，那是一朵凋谢了的郁金香。数百人争先恐后拍照，收藏家愿意把心头好展示同好，他花了一千三百万美金投得了这块布，他以此为傲。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;画家的名字叫｛阿李｝，这幅开始凋谢的郁金香，花瓣褪去了往日的妩媚，却散发著一股淡淡的寂寥之美。枯萎的花朵在光影交错中显得凋零而宁静，仿佛在述说一段轻盈而忧伤的故事。不禁让人感受到生命的无常，引人深思。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这名画家不出名的，但他有很多郁金香的作品，为什么他画这么多郁金香却无人知，他不仅画凋谢了的郁金香，也有盛放的郁金香，日照郁金香，昏暗郁金香，缤纷色彩的郁金香。可是画家｛阿李｝的资料并不多，听说他有两位兄弟都是喜欢郁金香。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;淡入...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在那片被时光遗忘的角落，有个家族世代相传的郁金香花园。每一代人，都以郁金香为骄傲，以郁金香为灵魂，也有著自己伟绩的故事。然而，钱财虽积，传承却不过三代人。当第五代的风华逝去，家族的光环渐渐黯淡，资源也快要花光，那片曾经茂盛的郁金香花园，更是变得一片凋零不堪。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;家族中，有三个男子，他们各自沉浸在自己的艺术世界里。｛阿李｝醉心于画布上的色彩，｛阿林｝痴迷于琴弦上的旋律，｛阿马｝则热衷于编织故事中的奇幻。他们仿佛活在自己的梦境中。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，现实中的生活是需要资源来运作的，孩子要喝奶，病要看医生，肚饿要食物，寒冬要暖衣，一切一切都要条件来交换。赚取金钱在生活中是不可或缺的，尤其这座豪华巨宅。可是，｛阿李｝、｛阿林｝和｛阿马｝对这些现实的困境却视而不见。拖欠薪债，一个个的佣人先后离开，妻子整天埋怨，然后一个个女人抱著孩子都走了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一天，阿李站在那片暗淡无光的郁金香花园面前，心情沮丧、眼泛泪光，所有郁金香都不再绚烂盛开，只有孤寂凋零。然而，四周围都空空如也，唯一值得画下来的，就只有郁金香。他看到了其中一朵郁金香，看起来将快要死，阿李有泪，花也泪著，阿李马上跑回家找颜料和麻布，陪伴著那朵郁金香，把它的精髓一笔一笔地勾画下来，画完后，他给它起了一个名字｛凋谢中的郁金香｝。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/e021a24c-5fed-4211-94b6-b4e19ac8e0b1.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;AI&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;这幅｛凋谢中的郁金香｝充满了悲凉与哀愁。郁金香里藏著了忧郁，每一朵让人难过，阿李索性每一天都来这里，把一朵朵的郁金香画下来，画完一幅又一幅，然后放到朋友的画廊，等待买家发现，即使结果是廉价。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;出人意料的是，｛凋谢中的郁金香｝居然有人高价买了它，然后更高价出售它，这举动引起人们的关注，阿李的名字渐渐出传遍了艺术圈。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因为｛凋谢中的郁金香｝的价值不菲，让其它郁金香画布的价值也翻了几番，阿李那一年几乎每天都在画郁金香，他画二百多幅画，自己也收藏了几十幅郁金香画布，郁金香画布更成为了上流社会讨论的话题。这种现像变得疯狂，并发展变成一个｛郁金香时代｝。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/90ddb934-9e3f-4d5a-8fa2-eb2fe1cdec80.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;拍摄:泳友-阿伍-Simon Ng&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛阿林｝和｛阿马｝见状，纷纷以郁金香为题材，创作出自己的作品。阿林的音乐如泣如诉，旋律就像哀伤和哭泣，点点的音符藏朵朵的郁金香里。｛阿林｝看著｛阿李｝的画布启发了他无限的灵感，写了许多的作品。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛阿马｝的故事则以快乐和谐感人为主题，他不想再要悲伤难过，人生已经太多难过了！快乐的故事一个个接踵而来。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一时间，家族的郁金香成了艺术的象征，三人也因此在当代的艺术家排行榜上赫然有名。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因为｛郁金香｝有很好的交换条件，它能为他们找回了很多的资源，孩子可喝奶，病可看医生，肚饿有食物，寒冬有暖衣，一个个的佣人先后回来了，一个个妻子抱著孩子回家，还可以买她们喜爱的珠宝首饰。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/c592052d-e0c6-4980-9aba-9603d8240724.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;拍摄:泳友-阿伍-Simon Ng&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，再光辉都会有黯淡时候，任何风潮都会过去的。｛郁金香时代｝只维持了三年，人们的目光不再聚焦在｛郁金香｝了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;令人难过的是，人生的起跌却没有改变了他们。郁金香再次凋谢，郁金香花园再次变得凋零不堪。看著这种困境还是视而不见，他们并不在乎再次失去任资源，因为，只有视而不见才能继续他们的梦境...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/8d7cb558-4264-4365-ade4-e8626d9600ee.jpeg/public&quot;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;莫斯科郊外音乐厅的恐怖袭击至今已造成 140 多人死亡，随着坍塌建筑的清理，估计这个数字还会继续上升。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在对这一事件感到震惊的同时，人们也看到了十分荒谬的一幕。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISIS 在恐袭发生后第一时间发表声明称对此次袭击负责，但普京的反应是：该死的乌克兰人！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISIS 又是发布照片、又是发布恐怖分子现场拍摄的视频，拼命证明这是他们干的。而俄罗斯当局则通过迅速发布所逮捕的恐怖分子抓捕以及刑讯视频，努力将乌克兰和此次恐怖袭击事件联系起来。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISIS 和俄罗斯当局好像正在进行一场极限拉扯：ISIS 竭尽全力想让人们相信这次恐怖袭击是他们干的，俄罗斯当局则一心要让人们相信乌克兰人参与了这次恐怖袭击。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISIS 为什么生怕别人不知道、不相信这是他们干的？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因为这是 ISIS 难得的宣传机会。它需要通过这种恐怖袭击向其支持者们宣示它依然存在、它仍能行动、它仍然值得资助甚至加入。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;单单是 2024 年，ISIS 已经认领了以下恐怖袭击事件：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 月 3 日，伊朗苏莱曼尼被杀 4 周年纪念仪式爆炸案，94 死，284 伤；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 月 6 日，阿富汗汽车爆炸案，5 死，15 伤；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 月 9 日，阿富汗汽车爆炸案，3 死，4 伤；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 月 28 日，土耳其教堂枪击案，1 死，1 伤；&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 月 30 日，巴基斯坦爆炸案，4 死，5 伤；&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 月 7 日，巴基斯坦爆炸案，30 死，数十伤；&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 月 9 日，莫桑比克恐袭案，至少 26 死；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 月 21 日，阿富汗自杀式爆炸案，21 死，至少 50 伤；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISIS 的前身是伊拉克境内的一个武装团体。它的意识形态是逊尼派极端伊斯兰，既反美，也反俄，同时也反对伊朗所代表的什叶派——这也是哈马斯站出来谴责 ISIS 的缘由所在。2014 年，这个武装团体利用敍利亚内战突然崛起，侵占了敍利亚东部大片领土，从而在 2015 年建立起了一个横跨敍利亚和伊拉克、辖有 1200 多万人口的伊斯兰国（全名是伊拉克和敍利亚伊斯兰国 Islam State of Iraq and Syria，缩写为 ISIS）。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在它极盛时期，许多国家的公民自愿加入了 ISIS，媒体上最常见到的故事是英国女孩跑去中东加入 ISIS。根据 2018 年的一份统计，总共有 860 名英国人加入了 ISIS，而 ISIS 中外籍兵员的最大来源国是俄罗斯，达到 5000 人。因为 ISIS 的极端暴虐和极具威胁性，它遭到了世界各国的联合绞杀，领头的国家便是美国和俄罗斯。目前 ISIS 所控制的领土已经极其有限，然而它在中南亚以及非洲仍然有诸多分支，在世界各地的穆斯林团体当中也仍然具有一定影响力。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISIS 和俄罗斯之间的敌对却要追溯到更早时期。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;苏联建立后不久，车臣和印古什都被并入。但在二战时，印古什和车臣这两个地方的穆斯林曾和德军一起跟苏联军队为敌。于是斯大林便将大批印古什人和车臣人强制迁移到了哈萨克斯坦等中亚地区。成千上万人在此过程中死亡，在印古什和车臣人的记忆当中，这是一次民族大灾难、也是苏联对他们进行的一次种族灭绝。2004 年，欧洲议会曾通过一次决议认定苏联在此事件中犯下种族灭绝罪。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;苏联解体后，车臣一度独立。但俄罗斯分别于 1994 年和 1999 年两次发动车臣战争，最终使得车臣成为了俄罗斯联邦的一个加盟共和国。车臣人针对俄罗斯的恐怖袭击频频发生。ISIS 崛起后，俄罗斯联邦内的许多穆斯林选择加入，其中大半便是来自车臣。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;俄罗斯当局为什么迅速认定乌克兰参与其中？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因为形势需要。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;俄罗斯当局现在需要的是俄罗斯人民爆发出对乌克兰的刻骨仇恨。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;教人去爱是很难的，但是教人仇恨却极其容易。而心中充满仇恨的人最好操纵。一旦心中充满了仇恨，理智便不怎么起作用了，当局就可以对他们如臂使指、指哪打哪。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;只要认定恐袭案与乌克兰人有关，不管有没有证据，重复得次数多了，总能激起许多俄罗斯人的愤慨。而这些愤怒的俄罗斯人又会压制敢于任何表示异议的俄罗斯人——质疑当局的结论就是为乌克兰辩护，而为乌克兰辩护岂不就是叛国，叛国者说的话还能有道理？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;如此一来，在俄罗斯国内，对乌克兰发动的战争就显得越发正义了，进一步扩大征兵范围的阻力也就小了，对普京的不满也被对乌克兰的仇恨掩盖了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这种方法，普京应该是使用得十分得心应手了。早在 1999 年，刚刚被任命为总理的普京就利用莫斯科公寓连环爆炸案发动了第二次车臣战争，从而一举奠定了自己在俄罗斯人心目中的「超级硬汉」形象。之后 2002 年莫斯科剧院和 2004 年别斯兰学校两起人质事件，都一再加强了其强硬形象，虽然代价是分别 130 多人质和 330 多人质的死亡。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这次恐怖袭击到底是谁干的？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;目前能做的判断是：乌克兰人的可能性最小，俄罗斯当局自导自演的可能性也很小，ISIS 的可能性最大。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因为发动这样的恐怖袭击对乌克兰来讲没有任何意义，也没有任何好处，只会让欧美皱眉、普京暗自心喜。欧美各国是绝对不会支持乌克兰人干出这种事的，如果知道是乌克兰人所为只会减少对乌克兰的支持。而这类恐怖袭击不但无法打击俄军的士气，只会让俄罗斯人更加团结在普京周围。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;当然，恐怖袭击的发生对普京来讲是有好、有坏。坏的一面是难免有人质疑他对乌克兰发动的战争削弱了对国内安全的保障，好的一面是在恐惧当中，俄罗斯人总是倾向于投入强者的怀抱；而且在仇恨当中，人们会更加支持对乌克兰的战争。显然，后者发生的概率要远大于前者。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;网络上有个寓言，老地主临终前问他儿子：「猪抱怨饲料差，牛抱怨活太重，鸡抱怨鸡窝太脏，怎么办？」儿子说：「喂好饲料，活轻点，清理鸡窝。」老地主摇摇头说：「你啥都别做，就只告诉他们说，外面有狼。」事实上，更绝的手段是控制防护栏损坏的时机，当抱怨声大的时候就放任狼进来咬死一批。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;俄罗斯当局根本不需要自导自演，只需要放松警戒、让恐怖分子轻松得手、事先圈定合适的替罪羊就成。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;所以这个音乐厅一年前还举行过反恐演习，但是这一次却让恐怖分子如入无人之境；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;所以音乐厅附近就是特种部队，但是特种部队却姗姗来迟；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;所以一方面 ISIS 称袭击者已成功逃出，另一方面俄罗斯却迅速宣布已经抓捕了 11 名嫌疑人包括 4 名袭击者，并放出刑讯视频。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>论语漫读（38）：大车无𫐐，小车无𫐄 — 为政就如驾车</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.red-publish.com/book/2990&quot;&gt;电子书：《论语漫读》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子曰：「人而无信，不知其可也。大车无𫐐，小车无𫐄，其何以行之哉？」&lt;/strong&gt;（为政第二）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/4a5be5b4-1e24-4893-9d39-337d18303a56.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;「人而无信，不知其可也」。历来多解释为：「一个人如果没有信用，不知道他还可以做什么？」但这样解释，与后面的比喻合不上。「大车」是牛车，拉重物，相当于现在的货车，故称大车；「小车」是马车，载人的，相当于现在的小车。「𫐐」和「𫐄」分别是牛车和马车的一个部件。具体长什么样，无关紧要，只需要知道是将马和牛与车体连接起来连接件就行了，就相当于现在汽车的传动装置。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;孔子将「信」比喻为车上的连接件，「人而无信」就如车无𫐐𫐄无法行驶，什么也干不了。所以这里将「信」解释为「信任」，比「诚信」、「信用」合理些，「人」也不是指单个的人，而是指「人们」，指一个群体，其中有拉车的，也有驾车坐车的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;整段话的意思是，「人们相互之间没有信任，不知道他们可以干什么。就如大车无𫐐，小车无𫐄，车如何可以行驶呢？」这很明显是在解释为政，所以才列入为政篇。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;结合到颜渊第十二篇中一段，可以相互印证。&lt;strong&gt;子贡问政。子曰：「足食，足兵，民信之矣。」子贡曰：「必不得已而去，于斯三者何先？」曰：「去兵。」子贡曰：「必不得已而去，于期二者何先？」曰：「去食。自古皆有死，民无信不立。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这里，孔子提出了保证统治的三大要素，分别是足食，足兵和民信之，「之」指统治者或统治者的政策政令。用现代话语来说，就是为民众提供物质保障、安全保障和得到民众的信任。食品是维持生存的基本物质保障，军队用于提供安全保障，民众信任才能得到他们的响应和支持。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但孔子认为民众的信任对保证统治最重要，必不得已，其它二者都可舍弃。食物匮乏，很多人就会饿死。但孔子认为自古以来，人总是要死的，饿死也是死。只是早死和晚死之分。只要民众保持对统治的信任，即使物质和安全匮乏，也能保住统治地位。「民无信不立」，并不是说民众不讲信用，民众就无法立身；而是说如果民众没有对统治者的信任，则统治者无法保住统治。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这里有个问题。如果统治者无法为民众提供物质和安全保障，又怎么能得到民众的信任呢？唯一的解释就只能是道德说教和洗脑。这用儒家思想是解释得通的，儒家提倡忠孝，用忠孝绑架民众，让老百姓视统治者为父母，即使挨饿受冻，被抢被害，也要保持对统治者的忠诚。所谓「饿死事小，失节事大」，「犬不择家贫，子不嫌母丑」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;回到「人而无信」，就能发现其含义主要是指民众对统治者的信任。就如牛和马要听驾车者指挥才能行驶。当然，驾车者也需要相信牛和马能载得动或能跨越障碍才行。为政就如驾车，老百姓是牛马，而统治者是驾车者。&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>法国新反对资本主义党关于参加即将进行的欧洲议会选举的声明│C’est officiel, le NPA sera bien présent aux élections européennes !</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;2024 年 2 月 26 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;译者：马由冰&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/d3badc83-d28f-44a3-9edb-8d7a5795b95b.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;几个月来，我们一直在强调我们参加 2024 年 6 月 9 日欧洲议会选举的决心，这将决定明年春天的政治局势。现在，在经由集体的力量筹集到了实现这一愿景所需的财政和政治资源后，我们的计划正在坚实地推进当中。我们的名单将由来自公共和私营部门的男女工人、学生和青年雇员组成，他们不仅代表了我们国家的各个地区，也展现了我们党及其青年组织的活力。在法国新反对资本主义党（NPA）第五次代表大会召开一年半之后，我们将在这次选举中代表共产主义、革命和国际主义政治潮流的连续性，对他们来说，选举不会改变生活，但提供了在更大范围内宣传结束资本主义的迫切需要的机会。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在这片大陆上，绝大多数人仅能依靠被通货膨胀破坏的工资、养老金和福利金生存，而大资本主义集团，尤其是那些将人民的鲜血转化为数以十亿计的利润的资本主义集团，却在大快朵颐，我们名单上的候选人将成为被剥削和被压迫者愤怒和斗争的代言人。它将捍衞欧洲大陆所有工人为赢得有尊严的生活而斗争的团结的必要性：每个人多拿 400 欧元，收入不得低于 2000 欧元！它将坚决反对所有为资产阶级服务的政党几十年来一直在帮助建立的、对其它大陆的男男女女布满围墙和铁丝网的欧洲「堡垒」。右翼运动，种族主义、民族主义、性别歧视和恐同症的入侵，并不是工人阶级对其日益加剧的困难的自发反应：它是由占统治地位的阶级通过那些在整个欧洲以他们的名义执政的人推动和培育的，无论他们被称为梅洛尼、欧尔班还是马克龙。我们捍衞开放边界，捍衞所有人的迁徙和定居自由。打倒极右翼，打倒所有为他们的仇外和反社会政策铺平道路的人！最后，我们将主张，应该由那些生产社会所有财富的劳动者来决定自己的命运、全人类的命运和地球的命运。是时候建立另一个没有贫困、剥削和压迫的社会了。为了实现这一目标，对于那些适应了以少数寄生虫占有共同财产和资源为基础的阶级分化社会的任何机构或政治力量，我们都不会寄予任何信任。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这场运动将完全独立于体制左派和改良主义左派，特别是「不屈法国」（France insoumise）[1]，因为它所捍衞的是一个与资本主义的维持相适应的方案。我们本希望这场运动能由各种极左翼思潮共同发起，我们也为此与工人斗争党（Lutte Ouvrière）进行了接触，但他们拒绝了我们的提议。我们欢迎任何赞同我们所捍衞的纲领的人给予支持。我们的运动发言人塞尔玛·拉比布（Selma Labib）、加埃尔·基兰特（Gaël Quirante）、阿尔梅勒·佩尔图斯（Armelle Pertus）和达米安·斯卡利（Damien Scali）已经准备好回应任何请求，并即将在全国各地举行一系列公开会议。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;巴黎，2024 年 2 月 26 日。法国新反对资本主义党（NPA）新闻稿&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1]由让-吕克·梅朗雄组建的左翼政党&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;原文链接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://nouveaupartianticapitaliste.fr/communique-cest-officiel-le-npa-sera-bien-present-aux-elections-europeennes/&quot;&gt;https://nouveaupartianticapitaliste.fr/communique-cest-officiel-le-npa-sera-bien-present-aux-elections-europeennes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>时间站在哪一边——台海危机的现状与展望</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（1）赖清德胜选，两岸关系会否生变？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;台湾总统大选落幕，民进党赖清德获胜。眼下各方最关心的问题是：赖清德接任台湾总统，两岸关系将会发生哪些改变？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;正像我先前讲过的，赖清德当选总统，两岸关系不会发生重大改变，中共不会对台湾动武。因为赖清德明确表示在两岸问题上他将维持现状，不会搞台独。顺便说明，什么是中共定义的台独？很简单，那就是修改中华民国宪法，把「大陆地区属于中华民国」这句话拿掉。但既然赖清德宣称他将遵循中华民国宪法，不会修宪，因此中共就不会对台湾动武。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;但是小的改变是会有的。因为赖清德本来就比蔡英文更绿。在胜选感言中，赖清德不把台湾叫作中华民国而叫作「中华民国台湾」，把大陆称为「中国」，这在中共看来都暗含着很强的台独色彩。所以大陆必定会做出一系列动作向赖清德施加压力。事实上，因为中共也预估赖清德很可能胜选，因此早在去年 12 月就开始施压， 宣布中止《海峡两岸经济合作框架协议》(ECFA) 下 12 个类别产品的关税减让措施；在投票前两天，中共当局又宣布准备进一步中止早期收获农渔、机械、汽车零配件、纺织等产品关税减让措施。就在台湾大选揭，晓的第二天，南太平洋岛国瑙鲁就宣布同台湾断交，使得台湾仅有的 12 个邦交国又少了一个。凡此种种，都表明中共向赖清德施加压力。类似的动作，中共还可能继续采取。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;去年 11 月，美国《外交事务》（Foreign Affairs）杂志刊出美国学者葛来仪（Bonnie Glaser)、白洁曦 (JessicaChen Weiss) 和柯庆生 (Thomas Christensen) 的文章。文章说，要遏阻中共在台海动武，美国单靠军事威胁是不够的，美国必须在做出惩罚威胁的同时，再提供北京「可信的再保证」 (credible reassurances)，而为了让这种「再保证」有效发挥作用，他们建议民进党总统候选人赖清德一旦胜选，应考虑冻结台独党纲。假如赖清德冻结了台独党纲，中共方面也会做出一些回应。例如，不再继续挖走台湾的邦交国，重新开放大陆的自由行和团客访台，恢复《海峡两岸经济合作框架协议》（ECFA）的若干措施，等等。但是因为赖清德很可能会像蔡英文一样，拒绝承认九二共识，拒绝直接说出大陆地区与台湾地区同属中华民国这句话，也就是两岸一中，海协会与台湾海基会的互动仍然不会恢复。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;前面说到，赖清德不会修改宪法，因此中共不会对台动武。但这决不是说，只要台湾不独，大陆就一定不武。中共国家安全部在 1 月 16 日发文，提到中共在 2005 年通过的《反分裂国家法》。《反分裂国家法》明确规定了对台动武的 3 种情形：1、「台独」分裂势力以任何名义、任何方式造成台湾从中国分裂出去的事实；2、导致台湾从中国分裂出去的重大事变；3、和平统一的可能性完全丧失。注意这第 3 种情形，这就是说，哪怕台独势力没有以任何名义、任何方式造成台湾从中国分裂出去的事实，哪怕没有发生任何导致台湾从中国分裂出去的重大事变，只要中共当局自己主观认定和平统一的可能性完全丧失，它就可以对台湾动用武力。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;按照这一条，既然多次民调都表明台湾民众不分蓝绿都拒绝中共提出的「一国两制、和平统一」方案，尤其是多次民调都显示大部分台湾人只认同自己是台湾人，不认同自己是中国人，那么在中共看来，这就可以认作和平统一的可能性已经完全丧失，因此已经可以对台湾动武了。哪怕你台湾不修改宪法，它也可以动武了。《反分裂法》还规定，国务院、中央军事委员会可以在必要时先采取行动，随后再向全国人民代表大会常务委员会通报。这就是说，《反分裂法》授权共军可以先斩后奏。这就是说，哪怕明天中共就对台动武，它也可以振振有词地宣称师出有名。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;之所以在眼下，中共还不打算对台动武，说穿了就一条：怕美军介入。关于这个问题，下面还要谈。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（2）乌克兰与台湾&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;俄国发动侵乌之战，使人们联想到台湾。中共打台湾，与俄国打乌克兰有一些可比性，但也有不可比性，俄国打乌克兰，可以有好几种不同的战略目标：目标 A——最好是把泽连斯基政府打倒，扶植一个亲俄的政府，然后再搞一次公投，乌克兰宣布回归俄罗斯，这对它是最好不过的。达不到这一目标，退而求其次，目标 B——扶植一个亲俄政府。如果这点还是做不到，那就是目标 C——让乌克兰一分为二，以第聂伯河为界，占领整个乌克兰的东部。如果这个目标也做不到，那就是目标 D——乌东地区占点算点，只要比前年 2 月 24 号开战之前多占了一些地方，普京就可以宣布，他的特殊军事行动取得了成功。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;俄乌战争打了两年多，现在看来，俄国的目标 A、目标 B、目标 C 都达不到了。乌克兰要收复失地，把俄军赶回到前年 2 月 24 日之前也很不容易。双方很难达成和平协议。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;中共打台湾和俄国打乌克兰不一样。中共只能有一个战略目标，那就是统一，如果达不到统一就输了，无论它对台湾造成多少损失，对中共而言，达不到统一就是输了。中共知道这一点，所以它不敢轻启战端。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;乌克兰尽管是得到国际社会公认的一个主权国家，但是出于种种原因，当俄国侵犯乌克兰时，没有一个国家直接出兵相助，这就是俄罗斯敢入侵乌克兰的原因。北约近在咫尺，一线之隔。如果北约愿意出兵相助，俄罗斯是不敢打的。台湾虽然没有得到国际社会的广泛承认，但是美国有个《台湾关系法》。如果中共武力犯台，美国很可能出兵相助，所以在现阶段，中共不会去武统台湾。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（3）中共统一台湾的「北平模式」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;近来，中国大陆、台湾和美国三方军机军舰频频现身台海。这让很多人担心，会不会擦枪走火引爆战争。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我以为擦枪走火引爆战争的可能性很小。中共国际关系专家、清华大学国际关系研究院院长阎学通讲过：「目前在南海和台海地区，都不会发生故意的擦枪走火，因为美国、中国大陆、台湾地区三方对军事行动的控制都非常严格。所以说，首先，在这些地区发生擦枪走火的可能性非常小；其次，即便发生擦枪走火，有关各方也一定能及时地把它控制住，不让它发展成为战争。」&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;近期内，中共会不会武统台湾？中共鹰派人物、《超限战》一书作者、解放军少将乔良说：台湾目前形势，文统无望，只能武统，但不可轻率急进，因为解决台湾问题的关键在于先解决中美实力对比。中美未分高下之前，台湾问题不可能彻底解决。只要不断提高和增强中国克服外部约束的实力，一旦美国没法介入，收复台湾如探囊取物。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;中共国台办原副主任王在希曾对媒体说，在和统和武统之间还有第三条道路可供选择，那就是采用围而不打的的「北平模式」，仅攻打外岛，以战迫和，以武促统，逼台北就范。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;中共赌的就是，在经过一段时日后，中国的军力有进一步增长，虽然不是在全球、但只要在台海局部区域取得优势，当它摆出武统台湾的架势，美国就会考虑，犯不犯得上为那么遥远的一个台湾去跟中国直接刀兵相见。一旦美国不肯直接出兵，那么面对中共大军压境，兵临城下，台湾也许就只有被「一国两制」，被「和平统一」了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（4）美国会出兵相助吗？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;无论是出于对普世价值的分享，还是出于对第一岛链的战略考量，美国都在坚守《台湾关系法》护衞台湾的承诺。这是 40 多年来美国历届政府一直坚持的立场。但是《台湾关系法》具有模糊性。它没有明确说一旦中共对台动武，美国是会出兵还是只卖武器。这几年，拜登总统几次回答记者提问都明确回答，美国愿意为保护台湾而介入军事行动。但这只是拜登总统的立场，以后的美国总统会不会也坚持这种立场呢？如果几年后国际形势有变，美中两国的实力对比有变，美国政府是否还会坚持这种强硬立场呢？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2021 年，美国智库「芝加哥全球事务委员会」做过一次民调。那次民调显示，如果中国武力犯台，过半数美国人赞成派兵保护。2022 年 6-7 月，美国&quot;德国马歇尔基金会&quot;与&quot;德国贝塔斯曼基金会&quot;对 14 个国家的民调显示，如果中国武力犯台，多数受访者比较支持以外交举措与经济制裁应对，同意对台湾输送武器和出兵援助的不到 5%；就连最支持台湾的美国，同意对台湾输送武器和出兵援助的也不到 10%。同年 8 月，佩洛西访问台湾，中共在台海进行大规模军演。这两件事强化了国际社会对台湾的关注，强化了民主国家的民众、尤其是美国民众对台湾的支持度。如果再做一次民调，结果很可能会和上一次不一样。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我认为，如果中共武力犯台，民主国家的民众大多数会支持以外交举措和经济制裁应对，同意输送武器会少些，同意出兵的更少。台湾是海岛，有海峡天堑，易守难攻。但也由于台湾是海岛，别的国家要运送物资和武器就更难，接收难民也更难。最严重的问题是，目前，全世界绝大多数国家以及联合国等国际组织都承认只有一个中国，台湾是中国的一部分。这就意味着，如果中共对台动武，国际社会都会因为那是中国内政，因此很难给台湾提供有实质性意义的帮助。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;不错，已故日本前首相安倍晋三讲过：台湾有事就是日本有事。但这话是安倍下台后讲的，要是在台上就不好这么讲。安倍讲了「台湾有事就是日本有事」后，中共外交部提出抗议，日本政府驳回中方的抗议，理由就是「因为安倍晋三已经不再是政府官员了」。既然现在日台双方连正式邦交都没有，日本怎么可能在中共武力犯台时出兵相助呢？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（5）警惕台湾沦为牺牲品&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在美国，一直有不同的声音。哈佛大学教授、「修昔底德陷阱」一说的提出者格雷厄姆·艾利森，曾在《外交事务》上发表文章，题目是「美国要学会尊重其他大国的势力范围」。文中讲到，1945 年 2 月 4 日雅尔塔会议期间，后来被称为「遏制战略之父」的乔治‧凯南给他的同事、时任罗斯福总统的俄文翻译兼苏联问题首席顾问的查尔斯‧博伦发去一封紧急密信。信中说，苏联会尽力维持对欧洲的大范围控制，问题是美国应采取何种对策。凯南问道：「我们为什么不可以体面而确定地和它妥协——坦诚地将欧洲划分成美苏各自的势力范围——确保我们不进入俄罗斯的势力范围，也不让俄罗斯闯入我们的地盘？」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;艾利森写到，凯南这一主张，成为后来数十年美国战略的支柱，其基本前提是对势力范围的接受，即承认某些地区将由苏联主导。在随后 40 年里，数任美国总统都经历了危机，因为美国的信条宣称某些权利是普世性的，所以当受苏联主导的国家内部寻求行使这些权利的自由斗士遭到镇压时，美国理当考虑派遣军队的选项。但历任美国总统都毫无例外地选择旁观而不是干预：比如艾森豪威尔面对 1956 年 10 月匈牙利事件，约翰逊面对 1968 年「布拉格之春」，等等。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;可以想见，如果美国政府接受艾利森的主张，像美苏冷战期间接受彼此势力范围那样，接受美国与中国各自的势力范围，台湾很可能是首当其冲的牺牲品。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（6）「一中两府」模式是可行之道&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;由于台湾与大陆大小悬殊，台湾的安全需要国际社会的维护。然而，由于台湾缺少国际承认，因此台湾的安全很难获得国际社会的维护。迄今为止，台湾得到的唯一的外部支持就只有美国。从长远看，台湾还需要更多的外部支持。近些年来，台湾在国际社会的能见度有显著提升。但是，台湾的国际地位并没有得到实质性的提升。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;去年，美国众议院以口头表决方式无异议通过一部旨在协助台湾抵御中国外交孤立的法案，厘清联合国 1971 年通过的 2758 号决议只承认中华人民共和国的代表是中国在联合国唯一的合法代表，并未涉及台湾在联合国的代表权，也没有对中华人民共和国与台湾的关系采取立场，或包含任何涉及台湾主权的声明。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这部法案似乎给别的国家承认台湾提供了一种可行的方式。但问题是，这部法案只在众议院得到通过，参议院还没有通过。台湾的一些邦交国本来想借助于这部法案提出的对联合国 2758 号决议的重新解读，促成台湾进入联合国。但是在不久前的联合国会议上，就连这些亲台湾的国家也没有把它作为正式议案向大会提出。别的国家逡巡不前也很好理解：如果以这种方式承认台湾是切实可行的，美国政府干嘛不带头这么做呢？英国外交大臣也发表讲话，赞同对联合国 2758 号决议的新解读，但是英国自己也没有以这种方式承认台湾。可见这种方式并不能帮助台湾摆脱在国际上的孤立困境。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在我看来，要使台湾摆脱被孤立的困境，最简单、也最可行的办法就是，美国在保持和中华人民共和国正式邦交的同时，又和中华民国建交。这就是「一个中国，两个政府」模式，也就是两韩模式。既然中共自己在宣示它的「一个中国」原则时，从 2000 年起，早就不再反对「一个中国，两个政府」了，早就不再反对以两韩模式处理两岸关系了，因此它不可能对此做出什么激烈的反应。有关美台建交的法理依据与现实可行性，我在「美台建交，此其时也」一文里有详细论述。这里就不再重复了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（7）时间站在哪一边？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2005 年 4 月，我曾经写过一篇文章「时间站在哪一边」。文章最后一段写到：「一切就归结到时间上。时间会站在谁一边？不少人会说，时间会站在台湾一边。因为台湾站在历史正确的一边。不过这是对较长的未来而言。在较短的未来也有可能出现相反的情况。关键是大陆。随着时间的推移，大陆是会变得自由民主呢，还是会变得十分强大但依然专制？结论：必须大力催化大陆自由民主。大陆能否及时地走上自由民主之路，关系到大陆人民的切身利益，关系到世界的和平与稳定，也关系到台湾自由民主的生死存亡。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;19 年过去了。19 年来，大陆没有变得自由民主，而是变得更强大而且更专制。今天的台湾比 19 年前更不安全。固然在 3、5 年内，台湾还是安全的；但 5 年、10 年以后呢？照目前这种趋势下去，未来的专制中国有可能变得更强大，不但台湾很可能会沦陷，整个世界的形势都不堪设想。因此，我们必须从根本上扭转这种趋势，我们必须促进中国大陆的改变，向着自由民主的改变。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>过份闪亮的夜空？光影表演与遗迹的张力</title>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;作者：远东钓鱼郎（澳门学 16 号作者之一）&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;在刚过去的农历新年，不知除了挤拥的街头外，各位读者是否留意到各处所举辨的应节活动。在众多务求使城市洋溢喜庆气氛的巡游汇演、烟火表演及装饰中，却有可谓特别「显眼」的例外。事缘政府在农历年期间，先后于大三巴&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://aamacau.com/2024/02/04/%e3%80%90%e5%9c%96%e8%bc%af%e3%80%91-%e4%b8%80%e5%a0%b4%e8%88%87%e6%b0%91%e5%90%8c%e6%ad%a1%e7%9a%84%e6%98%a5%e7%af%80%e9%9f%b3%e6%a8%82%e6%9c%83-%e8%ad%a6%e5%8a%9b%e5%8d%bb%e5%8c%85%e5%9c%8d/&quot;&gt;举办「光影表演」&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;，即于牌坊建筑表面投射不同的节日图像及灯光表演。由于表演灯光集中的关系，景观于远处亦能清晰看见。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;对于此一划破城市夜空、平日并不多见的城市景观，却有&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://aamacau.com/2024/02/03/%e5%a4%a7%e4%b8%89%e5%b7%b4%e7%aa%81%e8%ae%8a%e3%80%8c%e5%b0%84%e7%87%88%e7%a7%80%e3%80%8d-%e7%b6%b2%e6%b0%91%e7%9b%b4%e6%89%b9%e5%85%89%e6%b1%a1%e6%9f%93%e5%9a%b4%e9%87%8d-%e9%99%b3%e4%bf%8a/&quot;&gt;意见&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;认为强烈的灯光效果造成光污染。而于建筑上所「展示」的不同图像及内容，亦似乎与大三巴作为「遗迹」的景观格格不入。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/539c4717-7e8f-4959-9f95-94326a9a3106.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;大三巴举行「欢乐春节」启动礼以及「欢乐春节春满濠江」音乐会（Image: 论尽）&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;此次光影表演于美学及文化上的评价，各位读者或许心中有数，但如果我们把视角进一步拉长的话，或可留意到「光影」此一展演模式，事实上已在澳门扎根一段时间。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;从十年前的「澳门光影节」起，除了于澳门的历史街区设置不同灯光装饰，另一具代表性的展演，便是于澳门代表性遗迹（如大三巴）的立面上，投射不同颜色、图案，以及代表不同意象的展演。其中一个读者或许还有印象的&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://aamacau.com/2019/10/03/%e5%a4%a7%e4%b8%89%e5%b7%b4%e3%80%8c%e6%9f%93%e7%b4%85%e3%80%8d-%e6%95%99%e5%8d%80%ef%b8%b0%e5%85%89%e9%9b%95%e8%a1%a8%e6%bc%94%e6%87%89%e8%88%87%e5%ae%97%e6%95%99%e8%83%8c%e6%99%af%e7%9b%b8%e9%97%9c/&quot;&gt;例子&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;，便是 2019 年国庆时，政府于大三巴投射以红色为底色，庆祝中华人民共和国成立 70 周年的演出。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;事实上，光雕投影（Projection Mapping）作为一种于建筑物表面投影不同事物的技术，在外国的文化活动已被广泛应用。那么，我们为甚么会产生投射内容与投射对象（如遗迹）两者格格不入的印象呢？本篇文章正好利用大三巴再次被染色的契机，借由外国学者对于「遗迹与投影」此一议题的&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119706847&quot;&gt;讨论&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;，来思考「格格不入」的背后所蕴含的文化议题。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;只是一种技术？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;光雕投影的原理看似相当直观：投影技术把建筑物的立面视为一幅投影屏幕，把特定信息透过此一「屏幕」播放，并经由大众观看，从而使信息得以散播。此一信息传递的模式一方面相当短暂，随著投影的停止而结束，另一方面亦是一种「非介入式」的方式，亦即它并不改变建筑物的外观或结构，而仅是「借用」其表面作为媒介，因此并不构成对建筑物的永久性改变。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/338a27b3-158f-4a2e-85d9-b41a208140aa.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;2019 年为庆祝中国 70 周年，大三巴被染红（Image: 论尽）&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;但如果进一步思考，我们或可以发现这样一种技术，其实亦是一种改变对建筑物理解的方式。试想像我们平时在「观看」遗迹时，往往能想像到的，便是此一遗迹在「当下」所呈现的面貌，以及由其面貌所能联想到的历史。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;通过投影技术的介入，例如模拟重建遗迹的历史原貌或色彩，展示有关遗迹的历史资料，或是突显出遗迹本身不易看出的建筑特征等，皆能够增加对于遗迹的认识。进一步地，投影技术亦可透过更具实验性的方式，把遗迹变为艺术表演的一环，从而带来扭转对遗迹既定形象的可能性。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因此，透过改变遗迹在建筑上的外观，投影技术能为遗迹呈现一种与既有形象不同的面貌，并通过不同面貌而更新其形象，甚至能够产生新的意义。由此，投影亦可谓是一种「活化」遗迹的另类取径。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;甚么样的投影与遗迹&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;必须注意的是，上述的讨论其实预设了一种投影与遗迹的关系，那便是投影的呈现方式及内容至少在一定程度上，与遗迹的建筑形式及氛围相容。在现实的情况中，此种关系不但非理所当然，而且还有更多样及复杂的组合。这些不同的模式，亦把投影作为一种「介入」遗迹的方法，并预设了某种看待遗迹的方式。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;首先，投影的内容本身，事实上可以完全脱离于遗迹本身的背景。大家可以想像在平行时空中，大三巴的立面被用作投射有关澳门「手信」的广告内容。当然，杏仁饼跟猪肉干在当下的澳门，并非全然与大三巴无关的事物（或许有些人甚至把大三巴当作是手信街），但在此一种模式下，大三巴便已不再是那个充满历史氛围的学院遗迹，而只是被用作能够聚集人流的广告「布景版」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/6af0275b-9d72-459a-bed6-f6864b22d4c8.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;手信被投射于古迹，或许亦已不远，图为澳门圣若瑟修院（Image: 澳门旅游局）&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;退居次要的遗迹，便成为了一个仅仅是散播信息的媒介，其历史背景因此褪色；反之，其被社会认可的历史重要性，或会进一步被挪用作为投影内容「背书」的工具（因为它在文化上有一定地位，使得信息被「加持」）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;就某程度而言，当政府以「旅游论述」来论证光影表演「选址」于大三巴的合理性时，背后或许仍预设了大三巴作为代表性地标，能够极大化吸引观光人流的「优点」。至于究竟投影的信息与大三巴作为历史遗迹如何拉上关系，或许并非考量的重点。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;至于另一种投影技术与遗迹之间的关系，则主要透过即时性的呈现方式（例如在遗迹立面上进行视像的投影），在遗迹上进行艺术性表演。在此一关系中，表演往往透过「使用」遗迹的历史氛围，使后者的参与本身，成为表演不可或缺的部份。反过来地，表演在相当时候亦呈现一种遗迹与过去不同的面貌，从而丰富既有遗迹「历史」的意涵。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在外国的历史遗迹中，已有相当数量以艺术方式来呈现，或是说在遗迹上演艺术表演的例子。此种既非完全脱离于遗迹本身的历史背景，同时又非仅聚焦于补充遗迹资讯性需要的形式，或许切合澳门在文化上的需要（至于到底甚么才算得上是「艺术」则另作别论）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;小结：除了美丑以外&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;我想澳门的光影表演到底孰美孰丑，各位读者应该早已有自己判断的一套标准，但当这些表演正好上映在可谓见证澳门历史的遗迹时，大家或可思考这些表演想要呈现的，到底是甚么样的历史遗迹，而历史遗迹又如何受到五光十色的呈现方式所影响。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;投影的灯光虽然短暂，但在遇上长留此地的遗迹时，或会对我们记忆遗迹的方式造成更深远的影响。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#文章篇数：2️⃣0️⃣6️⃣&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#本文同时发表于&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot;

            <title>写给我梦见的那个被欺凌的小孩</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;亲爱的孩子：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;梦见你距今已经六年了。今天专诚写信给你向你表达感谢。感谢你让我对自己今生的使命有更清晰更透彻的了解。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;六年前的一个晚上，我在梦中见到你。你是个只有两三岁的幼童。当时我看见你和另外两三个比你稍大的小孩在一个房间。那两三个比你大的小孩合伙欺负你。他们打你巴掌，又把你的手脚朝著相反方向拉扯。幼小的你无力反抗，只能大声哭叫。当时在另一房间有几个大人。他们明明听见你的哭叫声，但仿佛若无其事似的继续麻将洒落。当时的我心急如焚，很想做些事情救你脱离欺凌。立即抱走你；或者赏那几个吃屎的大人几巴掌，迫使他们制止那几个欺负你的小孩。但在梦中，我只是观众，只能眼白白看著这一切，却什么都做不了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;那次的所见使我内心产生极大震撼。之后大约半年时间，我一想起你就会忍不住流泪。我自己也十分疑惑：只是一个梦境，为什么我对它的记忆如此深刻，情绪又如此波动？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;后来回头梳理整件事，我才发现梦见你的意义。在梦见你之前一段颇长的日子里，我正经历个人发展的低潮。我在做的所有事情都仿佛进入瓶颈，即使花尽力气推动也寸步难行。我开始质疑为何我要来到这个世界成为现在的自己？我今生的目的和使命到底是什么？为了解答这些问题，我曾经想过找催眠师替我进行前世回溯催眠，看看在出生之前究竟发生过什么事情，当时我的灵魂因何会决定来这世界。经过反复思想这个梦境，以及令我内心震撼的原因之后，我发现这个梦正是我要找的答案：眼见欺凌的发生，我不要只做观众。我要走进故事里面担任一个角色，去改变糟糕的情节。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;反观我们身处的现实世界，欺凌何尝不是无所不在，无日无之？帝王们为了满足争霸的欲望，不惜侵略他国，这难道不是欺凌？战地儿童遭到俘虏，硬生生地与父母家人分开，被带到远离家乡的地方，还要被灌输仇恨自己本国的思想，这难道不是欺凌？因宗教信仰的不同，整个部族的男人遭杀害，妇女被老酒成为性奴，这难道不是欺凌？每天在校园里、职场中，欺凌的事情更是多如牛毛。是的，我的灵魂当初决定要来，就是不想只当观众，而是要投入充满欺凌情节的故事中，担任一个能做些改变的角色。即使只是一个微不足道的小角色，都比单单观看来得强。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;不再继续做观众，开始投入故事的我，仍然充满无力感。个人力量实在太微小，而且受著自己在世的位置所掣肘，能做到的确实非常有限。即便如此，既然有幸来到，我会尽力发挥自己，把掌握的资源，得到的爱和幸福分享出去，期望尽量减少欺凌造成的伤害。孩子，我要衷心感谢你。因着你，我能看清楚今生的使命。不会再因个人发展的不顺遂而怀忧丧志。即使自己只是微弱的万分一光源，也要发出这份光。衷心希望当每一个万分一光源都亮起来时，这个世界不会再有欺凌。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;满心感谢你的陶乐思&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Liu Cixin and his &quot;Three-Body Problem&quot;: the Coexistence of Conscience Pollution and Grandeur Deep（4）</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(Continued from Part 3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(12) The magnificent epic of Social Darwinism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Compared with whitewashing dictators, gender bias, and contempt for the masses, which are the &quot;branches&quot; of Liu Cixin&#39;s thought, its socialist values 钬嬧€媋 re the &quot;trunk&quot; of Liu Cixin and &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Regarding the social Darwinist tendency expressed by Liu Cixin in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, I do not need to cite new examples. There are so many analyzes and examples in the previous article, and almost everywhere there is a social Darwinist flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The core of the so-called &quot;social Darwinism&quot; is &quot;the law of the jungle and survival of the fittest.&quot; These eight characters are also the core of the theory of evolution in nature, and Sheda moved this from nature to human society. These eight words may seem simple, but they can cover everything. There are many analytical studies on the specific content and manifestations of Social Darwinism, but I will not go into them here. I will directly analyze Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and Liu himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The three elements of a novel are characters, environment and plot. It can be said that these three elements are equal to the entire content of the novel. As for Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, its characters, environment, and storyline are all full of social Darwinism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Wade, Shi Qiang, and Zhang Beihai relied on unscrupulous means to achieve their important goals. Moreover, it is necessary to use methods that should not be even resolutely opposed under the evaluation system of civilized society in order to achieve its important purpose and save mankind. Vedder is a typical Social Darwinist, while the other two are not complete Social Darwinists, but sometimes show social Darwinist ideological tendencies and actions. Cheng Xin, on the other hand, is their opposite. Cheng Xin&#39;s thoughts and actions are in line with the moral principles and legal requirements of a civilized environment. She is even very caring, kind, and upright. However, these virtues are exactly the reasons for her failure and ultimately the destruction of most of mankind. The essential. To borrow a line from a poem, &quot;Despicability is the passport of the despicable, and nobility is the epitaph of the noble.&quot; These are, of course, characteristics and manifestations of Social Darwinism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The design and description of the environmental background in the article also make people feel the prominence of Social Darwinism. The &quot;dark forest&quot; theory and reality are where the socialist color is most prominent. In addition, such as the background of the Cultural Revolution and Ye Wenjie&#39;s experience, the process of human beings competing with the Three-Body Problem, and the performance of the &quot;rabble&quot; or various popular characters in the article, all reflect the cruelty and darkness of this society, including power, villains, cruelty, and lies. Betrayal of trust, bullying the weak and fearing the strong, bullying the good and fearing the evil... are all telling readers that Social Darwinism is the basis and mainstream of social laws, and only by adapting to this law of survival can we win or at least survive. Rejecting or even resisting the rules of Social Darwinism will not only Unable to survive, not even the dregs will be left after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not only from the basic elements of the novel, the social Darwinism of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is everywhere. According to the time and narrative sequence of the plot, Socialism also runs through the entire novel. (Although the opening part of the novel and the part recalling Ye Wenjie’s Cultural Revolution experience rarely involve the Trisolaran world, these human intrigues are all for the people who follow. The struggle in the Trisolaran world provided the introduction and foreshadowing). The process of human struggle with the Trisolaran world, the ups and downs of success and failure, are all related to the thoughts and behaviors of Social Darwinism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The simplified process of the confrontation between humans and the Three-Body Problem is as follows: The injustice and persecution of human society itself gave rise to rebels like Ye Wenjie. However, some other rebels joined the army of rebels against evil humans because their lives were too superior and their sense of morality and justice was too strong. After human rebels led to the invasion of Trisolaris, the earth fell into a deep trough in response to the crisis. But after the great trough, people learned from the painful experience of &quot;giving civilization to the years&quot; and achieved recovery. But after recovery, humans lost their vigilance and sense of crisis. At the same time, after learning about the opacity of human thinking, Trisolaris learned to deceive, successfully narcotized people in the illusion of peace, and then defeated humans in one fell swoop in the interstellar battle. And mankind has recovered from the desperate situation by establishing a dark forest deterrence system. But after recovery, he &quot;relapsed&quot; and once again relaxed his vigilance, became weak and undefended because of his emphasis on morality and &quot;human rights (&quot;human rights&quot; here also includes the right to life on other planets), and chose a &quot;holy mother&quot; like Cheng Xin as the &quot;obsessionist&quot; Swordman&quot;. And once again humanity was almost defeated because of this. The price of victory is to expose both the Earth and Trisolaris to the dark forest targets of the universe. And mankind once again lost the opportunity to escape the attack of the dark forest because of its emphasis on morality and &quot;human rights&quot;, and eventually all but a very small number of people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Obviously, all this reflects the social reality of Social Darwinism and the victory of Social Darwinism at the practical level. If you are imprisoned by morality and law, you will fail. If you follow the evil side of human nature and even the universe, you will survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The ideology of a novel is largely (or even entirely) the author&#39;s own ideology. The strong social Darwinist ideas of &quot;Three-Body&quot; are generally endorsed and owned by himself. Moreover, among Liu Cixin&#39;s works, &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is not the only one like this. In Liu Cixin&#39;s other work &quot;Ball Lightning&quot;, there is also an obvious flavor of social Darwinism. For example, the heroine Lin Yun forced the enemy to give up the invasion and allowed her country to win the war (or to save the crisis from the edge of failure and achieve an armistice) by dying together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Ball Lightning&quot; also contains more explicit socialist tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Yes, Dad, after listening to what I said, you looked at me silently for a while, and then took out two photos from the briefcase. The two photos were exactly the same, except that one corner was burnt and the other one was burnt. There were some brown marks on it, which I later learned were bloodstains. The photo showed a family of three. Both parents were military officers, but their military uniforms were very different from those of their father. They wore epaulettes that his father did not have at the time. The girl was as old as I&#39;m pretty much the same. She&#39;s a very beautiful child, with white and rosy skin, like fine porcelain. Growing up in the north, I&#39;ve never seen such good skin. Her hair is so black and long, all the way to her waist. , so cute. Her mother is also very beautiful, and her father is very handsome. They are really a family that I envy. But you tell me, these are two enemy officers, both of whom were killed in our shelling. They were separated when cleaning the battlefield. We found these two identical photos from the two corpses, and now the cute little girl in the middle has no mother or father.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The general said: &quot;I also tell you that the enemies who killed your mother were not bad people. They did that because they were soldiers and had to fulfill their duties, just like dad was a soldier and had to fulfill his duty to kill on the battlefield. Like a mortal enemy.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;钬︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On the battlefield in southern Xinjiang, one of my comrades-in-arms was licked by its tail. As a result, the skin on his body fell off as soon as it was touched. It was better to be alive than to be dead. In the field hospital, he used a pistol to kill himself while no one was paying attention. It&#39;s over. At that time, I thought of the mother I last saw in the hospital. The skin all over her body was ulcerated, and her fingers were swollen and black. It was impossible to kill herself with a pistol... This experience may make some people stay away from weapons for life, but it also It will make other people obsessed with it. I belong to the latter group. There is a power hidden in the terrifying machine. It is this power that fascinates me like a drug. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;钬︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Yun, we two women, for our ideals and beliefs, and for our motherland, have embarked on this less traveled road that women should not take. I have walked on this road longer than you, so I know its dangers better. More. All kinds of forces in nature, including those that people think of as the gentlest and most harmless, can be turned into life-destroying weapons, and some of these weapons are so cruel and terrifying that you cannot imagine it until you see it with your own eyes. . But I, a woman you think is like your mother, still want to tell you that our path is not wrong. I have no regrets about my life. I hope you can do the same when you are my age. My child, I have moved When I go to a place you don’t know, I will never contact you again. Before bidding farewell, I will not send you empty blessings. Blessings are meaningless to a soldier. I only give you a warning: those terrible things. Things may one day fall on the heads of your compatriots and relatives, or on the delicate skin of the baby in your arms. The best way to prevent this from happening is to create it before enemies or potential enemies. Come out! My child, this is the blessing I can give you.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;What information do these words convey? Different people will have different interpretations due to different values 钬嬧€媋 nd interests. However, it is completely defensible to say that it has a social color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It needs to be added that the most shocking social statement is this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Killing them all is the highest priority for a civilization.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In addition to what is in the book, Liu Cixin also performs in reality. As mentioned earlier, when he was debating with a scholar on the topic of &quot;whether to eat humans in order to continue human civilization,&quot; he tended to take the &quot;any means justify the means&quot; stance of cannibalizing people in order to achieve the goal of human continuation. In addition, in some interviews, he also expressed some tendencies, such as endorsing Xinjiang&#39;s &quot;re-education camp&quot; policy. Of course, he has also shown some neutral attitudes. For example, in an interview with media personality Li Jiajia, his comments had no obvious emotions, but were gentle and rational, and his words were pragmatic and neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As I said at the beginning, I certainly don’t have the ability to see what Liu Cixin is thinking through perspective. Everything is just speculation based on reason. I evaluate him as a social Darwinist or a supporter of social Darwinism, which I think is consistent with the facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Returning to &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, this book can be said to fully embody the various characteristics and manifestations of Social Darwinism. The most important thing is that the book tends to support sympathy rather than criticize Social Darwinism, or &quot;the law of the jungle, whatever the means.&quot; opposing. This is also what makes it different from other works that reflect the darkness of human nature and the ugliness of society. This is something that has been discussed before, but it really needs to be said again. Therefore, based on the breadth and depth of content, ideological tendencies, implications, and practical impact of &quot;Three-Body&quot;, it can be called a &quot;magnificent epic of social Darwinism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In fact, the reason why &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is considered to be a social Darwinist thought is largely because a large proportion of its readers are social Darwinists. They worship the laws of the dark forest and are interested in Thomas Wade, Shi Qiang, Zhang Beihai, etc. People admire him very much and admire the idea of 钬嬧€&quot;losing your animal nature and losing everything&quot; in the book, and then strongly praise the entire book &quot;Three-Body&quot; and highly worship Liu Cixin. . It is the understanding and interpretation of these people that makes the original social Darwinism color of this book even stronger. This is exactly what I want to say. The popularity of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; lies not only in the attractiveness of the content in the book itself, but also in its complementation with the values 钬嬧€嬧€嬧€媜 f the real Chinese people, which shows the objective reality of the social Darwin culture of China&#39;s intellectual group in the 21st century. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is worth noting that since the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China from the end of 2019 to the present, the economic situation has deteriorated sharply, and except for a very small number of people, life is generally difficult for most people. This gave Social Darwinists a heavy blow, allowing them to discover that &quot;having the ability&quot; and &quot;struggle&quot; still cannot lead to gains. This led to the decline of socialism and stimulated the rise of China&#39;s youth Maoists. But today, China&#39;s young Maoists still have a strong sense of socialism. Coincidentally but to a certain extent inevitable, Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; not only caters to socialists but also to young Maoists, so &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is still popular despite the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(13) 「What to do」 after 「what」?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Obviously, I have repeatedly described and analyzed some issues. Therefore, in the review section, I will not re-list the content, but will base my comments and analysis on what has been written previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Based on the key points I emphasized in the above specific narrative analysis, I acknowledge the existence of various dark and ugly realities mentioned by Liu Cixin; but on the causes and responsibilities of such realities, Liu Cixin and I have different views; but in There are fundamental differences in how to deal with such practical issues (even if some non-qualitative aspects are exactly the same). In other words, Liu Cixin and I have very similar views on &quot;what&quot;, but we have major differences on &quot;why&quot;, and our choices on &quot;how&quot; are qualitatively different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To borrow a few proverbs to summarize &quot;what it is&quot;, they are: &quot;A gentleman cannot defeat a villain&quot;, &quot;Despicableness is the passport of the despicable, and nobility is the epitaph of the noble&quot;, &quot;When you stare into the abyss (and have a grudge against evil, Confrontation), the abyss is also staring at you (you may become an equally evil person in the resistance, otherwise you can be called a &#39;forgiving person&#39;)&quot;, &quot;Good people don&#39;t live long, bad people live forever&quot;... So, what should we do? To be a &quot;gentleman&quot;, &quot;noble person&quot;, &quot;forgiving person&quot;, &quot;good person&quot;, or to be a &quot;villain&quot;, &quot;despicable person&quot;, &quot;evil person&quot;, &quot;bad person&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If under such simple conditions, many people may still choose the former, then what if conditions are added one after another, that is, the important interests of the losers are damaged/the things they care about are damaged? What about serious damage/serious damage to something you care about? What if you can&#39;t survive on your own? The country is destroyed and the family is destroyed, and things that are more important than life will be destroyed in a cruel way? Still choose the former?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If additional conditions are added, good people may not be completely good, and bad people may not be completely bad; good things may not all be advantages, and bad things may not all be disadvantages. There are more high-sounding excuses for choosing to be a &quot;villain&quot;, so how do you choose? Then, many conditions can be added to increase or &quot;ease&quot; the difficulty of selection (&quot;lightening&quot; the difficulty of selection may not necessarily mean &quot;reducing&quot; it), and then how to choose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This type of discussion is not uncommon, especially in developed democracies with free thinking after entering modern society. But there is no definite consensus in these discussions. In countries like China, such discussions are rare, but in reality such choices are constantly being made (although it may not be as clear-cut as the proverbs about good and evil, right and wrong). As for what to choose, it should be well known. Of course, it is not just China. Every person in every country of mankind will face these choices. Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; raises this issue more profoundly and sharply. Wade&#39;s words, &quot;If you lose your humanity, you lose a lot; if you lose your animality, you lose everything&quot; is Liu Cixin&#39;s condensed answer to the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Realistic choices are of course more complicated, but there are always relative good and evil, victory and defeat, good and evil, rise and fall. We often have to make choices, especially when it comes to the fate of individuals, families, communities, countries, and humanity. Each of us may participate in this choice or even participate in this choice many times in our life. Maybe we don&#39;t need to be crazy. We don&#39;t always choose to become evil in order to survive, but it will never be clean after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(14) About Liu Cixin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A person&#39;s masterpiece represents the person himself to a large extent. Liu Cixin is no exception. My analysis and evaluation of the ideological value of this book are, to a large extent, my analysis and evaluation of Liu Cixin himself. I have also specifically mentioned Liu Cixin’s personal words and deeds many times before. If his works are not based on the current values 钬嬧€媌 ut eulogize justice and light, and speak out and cry out for the weak, then he is undoubtedly a great writer with the depth and value of his thoughts. But now he cannot afford the word &quot;great&quot;. But there is no doubt that his thoughts are profound, his imagination is bold and rich, and his expressive ability is amazing. His depth of thought, imagination and expressive ability can be said to be at the top among many writers in ancient and modern times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Although Liu Cixin&#39;s works are all about science fiction, they have a strong sense of realism. What it says and metaphors are all things that have happened, are happening, and will happen in the real world. Rather than saying that Liu Cixin is a science fiction writer, it is better to say that he is a special realist writer. But he is different from other critical realist writers. On the one hand, this is because the dark cruelty of the value orientation he promotes is completely different from the works of writers who praise bright justice and sympathize with the victims. On the other hand, he blends reality into science fiction. , and set its sights on the extremely distant future that ordinary people cannot reach, making prophetic judgments that feel quite real and even true, linking the reality of human nature and society with the destiny of mankind and even the universe in the extremely distant future. For example, its depiction of the changes of human beings and the universe at different time scales gives people an extremely intuitive and real feeling, making people feel that this is not a science fiction novel but an epic of human beings and the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Judging from these, Liu Cixin is a giant writer. However, based on what Liu Cixin did in reality, he didn&#39;t look like a real giant. Although his thoughts are profound and his language in various interviews is plain, rigorous, broad and profound, you can see the aspects he exposed in interviews and other matters, as well as his return to &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and other works themselves. This is due to his shallow humanistic background and lack of moral concern (of course he also has some relevant background and certain care, but compared to his status as a &quot;giant&quot;, these are far from enough). Fans of Liu Cixin will make various excuses, and even generally regard this as an advantage rather than a disadvantage. As I said before, Liu Cixin&#39;s fans regard cold-blooded cruelty as mature rationality. However, the judgment of any writer must be based on universal morality and conscience. Liu Cixin is obviously &quot;unqualified&quot;. Just his respect for and whitewashing of the dictator who caused such huge disasters makes him no longer worthy of being called &quot;great&quot; (no matter how amazing his talent is).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, after Liu Cixin won the Hugo Award and &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; became popular around the world, she has become a world-renowned writer and public figure with great influence. He also often gives interviews and discusses his works with Chinese and foreign people. However, in the ten years since he became famous, he has never actively commented on national and social affairs related to the public interest (only when asked did he say something that is in line with the current Chinese government&#39;s position). He has never used his influence to do anything constructive for his two hometowns (Henan where he was born and went to school, and Shanxi where he worked and settled), which are still relatively poor and backward. He has never done anything constructive for the fellow villagers who are suffering in his hometown. Once (but after he became famous, he quickly returned to Tieba to anonymously respond to colleagues who had criticized him. Although it is understandable, it also shows that he cares more about personal emotions and does not consider the overall situation of the country and mankind, even if his thoughts extend to the universe) . In the face of various major controversial issues in China and the world, and many realities in Henan and Shanxi provinces that need to be criticized and changed, he chose to avoid them, which can be said to have no public awareness and sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is not because he cannot see the darkness and crisis in reality. On the contrary, he is very aware of it but refuses to talk about it. In &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and other works, he reflects that he has a good understanding of the dark side of Chinese society, and even learned through some channels far more inside information than ordinary people can know. However, he refused to directly mention real issues and only discussed the fictional and abstract content of his works without connecting them with reality. For example, in his &quot;The Wandering Earth&quot;, he talks about the earth encountering a crisis of destruction, countries taking measures to deal with it, and the people refusing to cooperate and even rioting due to conspiracy theories. The entire plot is almost exactly the same as the hazards and reactions of the climate crisis that humans face in the real world. But Liu Cixin has never commented on the climate crisis, even though he has mentioned in some interviews that humans should plan for the long term and prevent crises in the universe that may destroy humanity. With Liu Cixin’s erudition and intelligence, it is impossible for him to not understand the huge harm that the climate crisis has on mankind, but he remains silent. Liu Cixin has never expressed any opinions on China&#39;s high-intensity lockdown measures and its impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in recent years. Liu Cixin&#39;s behavior is not only indifferent, but shameful; he is not ignorant, but it is also more corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The thoughts and values 钬嬧€嬧€嬧€媜 f Liu Cixin&#39;s works are contradictory and very consistent with his personal character and moral level. This sentence may not be easy to understand at first sight, but for those who are familiar with &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and know Liu Cixin well, it should not be difficult to understand as long as they think a little dialectically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The coexistence and even unity of grandeur, profundity and pollution of conscience is the most appropriate and concise evaluation of Liu Cixin’s The Three-Body Problem and Liu Cixin himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But in any case, &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is still worth reading, and Liu Cixin&#39;s thoughts should be understood by more people. We should also think about why there are no people with high moral character and both ability and political integrity in China or even in the world to write a masterpiece like &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. Perhaps, this is the same as the previous difficult choices. Only by accepting the gaze of the abyss can we truly understand what the abyss is. When a person understands the truth about human beings and even the universe, but does not have enough faith to uphold his conscience, he will not be able to get out of the moral and cognitive opposition, which will eventually lead to hissoulof nothingness and depravity. This is really sad and a common occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Liu Cixin and his &quot;Three-Body Problem&quot;: the Coexistence of Conscience Pollution and Grandeur Deep（3）</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;(Continued from Part 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(9) Cheng Xin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cheng Xin is the character Liu Cixin writes about the most, is criticized the most by fans of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and Liu Cixin, and is the most controversial character in this book. To put it simply, she is the opposite of Thomas Vader. Of course, the details are much more complicated. This character is very important and is the focus of the book review, so I have to talk about it in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Holy Mother&quot; is the word most commonly used by fans of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and Liu Cixin to call Cheng Xin. Of course, this is not a compliment, but a deep disdain. If you understand the context of the Chinese Internet, you will know that the word &quot;Madonna&quot; is not only not a good word on the Chinese Internet, but also a particularly malicious and defamatory term. This is also highly relevant to the reality of China, which is highly social Darwinist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, the original meaning of the word &quot;Madonna&quot; on the Chinese Internet is not particularly different from that in the West. It refers to a person who is overflowing with love, loves and tolerates everything, and opposes all hatred and oppression. This kind of people have different attitudes (well, to be precise, &quot;some Chinese people and some Westerners have different attitudes towards this kind of people&quot;). In China, the definition of &quot;Mother&quot; also includes the characteristics of not distinguishing between right and wrong, having no concept of right and wrong, having no position or principles, and blindly exporting love and sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Chinese people hate this kind of people. They believe that this kind of &quot;Madonna&quot; can only do bad things, betray the interests of their own country and ethnic group, and ultimately harm others and themselves. In China, a jungle society, this kind of consequences does often occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I always say China, China, isn’t the world like this? Isn’t it a developed Western country? There is indeed ingratitude and repayment of kindness everywhere in the world, and there are many stories of &quot;farmers and snakes&quot; being played out in the West. I have said repeatedly before that this world is still a jungle world. But this does not mean that everything in the world is like this. All groups in all regions of the world live with such values 钬嬧€媋 nd behaviors. They are not the same as those in China (even if they are fundamentally the same in terms of &quot;quality&quot;, there are differences in &quot;quantity&quot;. (very different), a society where there are many 「Holy Mothers」 and good deeds can be rewarded well. This is at least the case for a large part of the Western European and American leftists they attack and vilify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, the Chinese people have no sympathy and support for this, but are even more resentful. I don’t know whether it’s jealousy or disbelief, or both (yes, it seems that these two cannot be both for the same object at the same time, but the Chinese can (again, please correct me, it’s 「some Chinese」 who can )). They don’t want to believe that there is really love and peace in this world, or they are extremely jealous, so they madly attack all kinds of 「white leftists」, 「Mothers」 and even such fictional characters. Cheng Xin in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is one of the targets. Of course, there is another kind of person who hates Cheng Xin, but we will talk about this kind of person later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As soon as the name Cheng Xin appeared (the character had not officially appeared), he was reviled by readers (of course this is because they already knew some of the following content in advance, or read it and started from the beginning, and then made notes here). And she officially appeared on the stage when Yun Tianming was about to be euthanized (attempted). She saved Yun Tianming and then said, &quot;You know what? Euthanasia is prepared for you.&quot; This sentence has been sprayed with invisible spit by countless people countless times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, judging from this plot, Cheng Xin deserves to be criticized because she did something immoral. But if it had been done by other people, such as Wade, Shi Qiang, Zhang Beihai, and Luo Ji, these people wouldn&#39;t be so abusive, and would even think it was a decisive act of choosing the greater at the expense of the small. However, Cheng Xin couldn&#39;t do this because she was the &quot;Madonna&quot; and had moral shackles, and whatever she did would be scrutinized. When you are a good person, you cannot do this kind of thing, otherwise it will be &quot;hypocrisy&quot; and &quot;double standards&quot;, even if it is far less hypocritical and double standards than the critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of this, many people must think that I am deliberately trying to be more truthful, it is just a storyline, and readers are just cursing for the fictional story, just to vent their anger. If that were the case, there would be no need for me to say this, or even write the entire article. Of course this is not the case but the opposite. Literary works and interactions with readers deeply reflect the real world and the judgments and choices of real people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the part where Cheng Xin participated in the &quot;Ladder Plan&quot;, no one criticized Cheng Xin. There was nothing to criticize about these technical issues. On the contrary, people should admire her technical level (but this does not prevent her from continuing to criticize her later). Some people even To criticize Liu Cixin for portraying female stereotypes. This is a rare phenomenon among Chinese readers, or it may have only appeared later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Then, there is the plot where Cheng Xin knew that Yun Tianming sent him stars, and then tried her best to prevent Yun Tianming from being &quot;euthanized&quot; but failed. Cheng Xin knew about Yun Tianming&#39;s love for her, so she wanted to save everything. This was logical, and it also showed that her decision to allow Yun Tianming to have euthanasia was not an act of betrayal but an honest mistake. However, here again there are scoldings for her &quot;hypocrisy&quot;. Is she really hypocritical? Obviously not. If we really wanted to condemn him, shouldn&#39;t we blame Vader for being unscrupulous and willing to complete the mission despite knowing that Yun Tianming was Cheng Xin&#39;s lover (or deliberately doing so to make a non-ridiculous prank)? Of course, saying this will make everyone think that I am too serious and boring. But I think those who criticized Cheng Xin for ignoring Vader probably did the same thing in reality. There is no risk in condemning a good person, but there is trouble in attacking someone who is aggressive. And as mentioned before, people always blame good people for their faults, but for bad people it is &quot;there is no need to condemn them because they are bad&quot;. People&#39;s views on artistic figures have always been a reflection of reality, but sometimes they are exaggerated, but the essence is still a reflection of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The next point where Cheng Xin was ridiculed was when she ran for the Sword Bearer and was elected. People chose her, who represents love and peace, as the sword bearer, replacing Luo Ji, who had become serious and tough (he was cynical before), and they did not choose Cao Bin, Bi Yunfeng and others who were similar to Wade. This laid the foundation for mankind&#39;s loss of deterrence against the Trisolaran world. Cheng Xin&#39;s cowardice and hesitation when the three-body detector &quot;Water Drop&quot; attacked the deterrence facility became the focus of intense ridicule and abuse from readers. This performance is also the core factor why Cheng Xin was attacked, cursed and ridiculed, that is, her &quot;holy mother&quot; love and weakness can cause bad things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In fact, I can quite understand the ridicule and abuse of Cheng Xin in this paragraph, and I quite agree with it. Liu Cixin&#39;s arrangement of this content is indeed very reasonable to a certain extent. This is indeed a fatal flaw for those who are considered &quot;white leftists&quot; and &quot;holy saints&quot;, although it may not be a fatal flaw for everyone among them. Kind people always don&#39;t want to hurt others, let alone destroy or die together, or even want to sacrifice themselves to achieve others. And if it is responsible for the rise and fall of a country or nation, then this kind of behavior will lead to the collective sinking or destruction of the entire nation. This is indeed the weakness of the kind and the advantage of the cruel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But like I said before, this is true, but should it be so? Do we have to become evil in order to win? Not necessarily. It’s not that we can’t cultivate people who 「use thunderous means to protect the heart of a Bodhisattva」. There are many such people in reality. During World War II, the German and Japanese armies were extremely ferocious, and the US military was regarded as the &quot;young master soldier.&quot; However, the US military finally defeated the Japanese army, and the US military was also the first to contribute to the defeat of the German army on the Western Front. This has something to do with weapons and equipment, but the US military is not generally afraid of life and death. As for today&#39;s &quot;white left&quot; politicians, many times they just want to abide by their principles and prevent the country and the world from falling into a vicious cycle of retribution and violence for violence. If they really take action, those stubborn and cruel people may not be their opponents. In fact, the &quot;white left&quot; is even more firm in its belief in justice. Wasn’t Robespierre a 「white leftist」 three hundred years ago? The stubborn and conservative old nobles were still beheaded one after another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, a person with Cheng Xin&#39;s personality and value choices is indeed not suitable for such a task that requires decisive killing. If all human beings become weak and lose their vigilance and fighting spirit, they may indeed be &quot;annihilated&quot; by the few remaining crazy and stubborn people. Liu Cixin&#39;s original intention may not be good, but it objectively reminds us that when we maintain goodwill, we should not put down the sword in our hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, from another perspective, is fighting to the death or even dying together really the best choice (whether for oneself, the entire society, or even the opponent), or is this kind of mentality game the best deterrent? Most fans of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and Liu Cixin would say &quot;yes&quot;, but my opinion is wavering between right and wrong. Indeed, the more determined you are to die together, the more likely you are to win the game. This is the core of the game of &quot;who will give in first&quot;. But if no one is willing to bow his head, the world will be destroyed by constantly playing this game. Or, all parties will rack their brains to strengthen themselves and weaken each other, and use any means at any cost. Human beings will lose their conscience and kill the other party or suppress it absolutely. Reason will never be able to defeat the fist. Hatred and the weak will expand with the blessing of intelligence, and the human world will become More jungle than animal jungle. As for the balance of deterrence, is there ever a balance? Will there not be a moment of loss of control? Is such a world really good? Who can be sure that he is the ultimate winner? Or is there a final winner? Should those losers live by the victors? Is this the human civilized world we pursue?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But if you don&#39;t do this, then those who do it will win and dominate the group, region, country, and world. Such a world is, of course, hell. Therefore, in order to fight against the devil, I have to become the devil. I just hope it is a devil who is not so evil, or preferably has the methods of a devil but the heart of an angel. But how could the angel&#39;s mind not be polluted in such a game and competition for survival?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The next point where Cheng Xin was taunted and attacked was for the same reason as before. Cheng Xin stopped Vader and others from researching the light speed spacecraft and asked them to give up their confrontation with the government and put down their weapons. And this also doomed almost all human beings to extinction. Ironically, she ended up being one of the very few survivors who did not become two-dimensional with the solar system. Her prevention led to the almost total annihilation of humanity in the solar system, but she was able to escape. It would be strange not to be scolded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But this is also her good intention to do bad things. Or maybe it&#39;s because she always does bad things with good intentions, which makes her even more detestable. If someone had bad intentions and did bad things, like Wade or Ye Wenjie, people would not be so aggressive and abusive. This is what I said before, so I won’t dwell on it anymore. At this point, she deserved to be scolded. However, I still want to emphasize the good intentions, because &quot;good intentions&quot; are already rare things in the real world, and bad things done with good intentions do not always happen. In many cases, the probability is still less than 50%. %of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In fact, Liu Cixin also wrote many plots in her article that almost everyone thought were positive and shining points of Cheng Xin, such as giving up the huge sum of money that the United Nations could pay her to buy the star that Yun Tianming gave her, but choosing to donate it instead , meeting Yun Tianming for a responsible adventure, and giving up the small universe to return the quality of the universe for the purpose of restarting the universe. These have also been praised by many readers. But why do so many people still abuse Cheng Xin? Do these two waves of people overlap?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is some overlap. Some people can separate and evaluate a person with coherent behavior, affirming some parts of them but rejecting other parts. If one part deserves recognition and the other part deserves disdain, then of course that is okay and very appropriate. However, it is foolish or morally corrupt to deny outright something that should not be cast aside or should be evaluated more comprehensively and objectively, or if the denial fails to get to the point and instead is insulted indiscriminately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There are also some parts that do not overlap, and they are consistently abusive towards Cheng Xin. In addition to the jealousy I mentioned earlier or the belief that a &quot;holy mother&quot; like Cheng Xin cannot be trusted, there is another reason that is even more terrifying. That is, those evil people and scoundrels, including sanctimonious conservatives and green-faced and fanged Social Darwinists. These people reviled Cheng Xin and all &quot;white leftists&quot; and &quot;holy mothers&quot; because they were deeply afraid that the world would change to love and peace, and that they would be excluded or assimilated. In order for themselves to continue to live in evil, for their evil values 钬嬧€嬧€嬧€媡 o last forever, and to achieve their various practical and value interests, they must denigrate, completely deny, and criticize the &quot;white left&quot; and the &quot;Mother of the Holy Mother&quot; in every possible way. , so that the ugly values 钬嬧€媡 hey advocate can continue to prevail in the world, and these people can continue to thrive. There are many such people in the world, especially in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is worth mentioning that Liu Cixin himself also has a rather negative view of the character Cheng Xin he created. It does not mean that he is dissatisfied with the portrayal of the character Cheng Xin, but that he is disgusted with people with characteristics like Cheng Xin. Therefore, Liu Cixin himself is one of those people who attacked and abused Cheng Xin, and his views are more profound (how can he not understand the image he created deeply), so his evil is also more terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Finally, let me talk about my evaluation of people like Cheng Xin. I think it is 60% positive, 60% right (not 60% &quot;right&quot;) and 40% wrong. Their quality is commendable, but their value choices are often undesirable. If love and peace could solve everything in the world, world harmony would have been realized long ago. For the sake of justice, we have to make some bad preparations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(10) Gender bias controversy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; was published (especially after it was translated into English and other foreign languages 钬嬧€媋 nd won the Hugo Award), it caused great controversy. One of the controversies is that he believes that his works are sexist and stereotypical against women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After reading the full article, I found that this is indeed the case. I have said before that his portrayal of Ye Wenjie, Shao Lin and the female Red Guards reflects discrimination and prejudice. In fact, more than that, there is widespread and obvious sexism and prejudice in more parts of the book and overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Throughout the book, Liu Cixin portrays more than ten main characters, most of whom are relatively positive characters (at least these people are &quot;essentially good people&quot;). Most of these people have made a lot of sacrifices and made outstanding contributions in saving the earth. Except for Say, who is set to be the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who is a woman, these characters are all men, such as Luo Ji, Shi Qiang, Zhang Beihai, Thomas Wade, Cao Bin, Taylor, Ray Diaz, Wang Miao, Chang Weiss et al. Even Sai, who clearly has a positive image and has made great contributions, is a supporting role with a limited number of appearances. And the few negative images are almost &quot;taken over&quot; by women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In addition to the female Red Guards I mentioned earlier, there is also a special vilification of female images. At the end of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, it is written about the two-dimensionalization of the solar system, the scene when Cheng Xin and Ai AA left in a light-speed spacecraft, and other people trying to escape discovered them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Look, why is that ship accelerating so fast?!&quot; a woman screamed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Oh my God, the people in there are going to be crushed to pieces,&quot; one man said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Then another man&#39;s voice appeared: &quot;You idiots, an accelerating spacecraft like that will be crushed! But it doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s not a fusion engine, that&#39;s a space curvature drive!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Warp drive?! Light speed ship?! Light speed ship!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;It seems that the rumors are true. They are secretly building a light-speed spacecraft and escaping by themselves...&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Ah ah ah ah ah! Ah! Ah!!!&quot; This is the voice of the first woman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;The one in front, intercept it! Hit it to death!!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was the woman&#39;s voice again, &quot;Ah! They can reach escape velocity, they can escape! They can live!! Ahhhh!! I want a light speed ship!! Stop it! Kill the people inside!!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The vilification of women is self-evident. In addition, there are some small figures with negative images that go unnoticed. For example, the director of the neighborhood committee who drove Luo Ji away was also a woman (of course, in reality, most neighborhood committee directors are indeed women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is also the objectification of women. For example, Luo Ji&#39;s wife Zhuang Yan is a highly objectified female image. Of course, this is not entirely a stereotype, but a character image deliberately designed by Liu Cixin to meet the needs of the plot (such as to set off Luo Ji&#39;s character and its changes). But on the other hand, it is not necessary to set up other characters and storylines that vilify women, and the negative characters do not have to be set as women (but Liu Cixin set them up like this).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cheng Xin, the &quot;Madonna&quot; image who &quot;does not succeed enough but more than fails&quot;, is a woman, and there is a faint hint in the book that it is her femininity (&quot;Madonna&quot;) that makes her &quot;lost.&quot; This has been explained and analyzed in the previous section dedicated to the analysis of Cheng Xin, so I will not repeat it again. Cheng Xin is also the female character in Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; who permeates sexism and stereotypes most quietly and deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The female scientist Ke Manlin, who has the opposite personality and temper to Cheng Xin, is the kind of woman who is rude and also likes to compete with women (women find it difficult to be a woman).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Use resources to change the principle?&quot; an older French woman named Cormanlin said in a disdainful tone. She was a senior consultant from the European Space Agency. She noticed the way the men looked at Cheng Xin, and she felt very uncomfortable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;钬︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There were several more laughs, and Ke Manlin laughed the loudest, &quot;Honey, you provided us with a cartoon-like scene...&quot; With more and more laughter, she continued, &quot;You&#39;d better do it again. Assignment for freshman year, calculate push-to-weight ratio.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;钬︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The men&#39;s eyes turned away from Cheng Xin one by one. Now they finally began to seriously consider what she said, and their admiration for her was temporarily ignored. Only Ke Manlin kept staring at Cheng Xin, as if she didn&#39;t recognize her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;钬︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She held the document up for a few seconds, and instead of handing it to anyone, she dropped it hard to the ground.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;What the hell!&quot; Ke Manlin yelled angrily.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;钬︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;You, and you,&quot; Wade pointed at Cheng Xin and Ke Manlin, &quot;Such senseless mental loss will not be allowed in the future.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Due to space issues and the trivial distribution of related content, I cannot list all the discrimination and prejudice against women in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, but the above examples are enough. In fact, other readers have also seen it, so there is no need. I list and repeat them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These are undoubtedly sexist and biased. But is this an objective fact to some extent? That is, are women really like this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In my personal opinion, first of all, fundamentally speaking, the negative behaviors and negative personality traits of these women portrayed by Liu Cixin, especially the various ugly words and deeds, are common to both men and women and are not unique to women. Secondly, it is true that to some extent and under certain circumstances, women do have some characteristics that are different from men in some aspects, such as the above-mentioned vilified or stereotyped images or words and deeds. However, the degree is far less serious than Liu Cixin&#39;s portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And, are they born this way, or have they been shaped and disciplined into these ways by the patriarchal society? This question is important, very important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I believe that this is of course the result of acquired social environment, rather than an innate inevitable situation. Women are particularly intolerant, anti-intellectual, objectified, and weak in some things and situations. They are created, seduced, and forced by society, to be precise, the patriarchal society. Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;Three-Body&quot; is a person who participated in the creation and creation of this. Part of the temptation and coercion. This is like saying that &quot;the cultural quality of migrant workers is low.&quot; It is not that the quality of migrant workers is inherently low, but that they are often in poor family and social environments and do not have the conditions to receive a good education and a good external environment. They are Victims rather than natural low-quality bad elements. What we need to do is to sympathize with and change, and to condemn the people or institutional environment that caused such consequences, rather than scorning, ridiculing and pointing fingers at these victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the same way, the intolerance, anti-intellectualism, objectification, and weakness of women are not a reason to discriminate against women, nor are they an excuse for the patriarchal society to oppress and blame women. On the contrary, they are victims, and they need to bear the responsibility of the patriarchal society. Responsibility, through changes in systems, culture, and habits, to reduce or even eliminate non-biological gender differences and achieve true gender equality and gender justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What needs to be emphasized in particular is that the differences between men and women in certain traits that I am talking about are far smaller than the differences within men and women, and are generally smaller than the differences between groups with different levels of education and income. . Regardless of physical or non-physical aspects, the commonalities between men and women are far greater than their &quot;personality&quot; or specificity, especially in non-physical aspects. People can discuss and have their own opinions on gender differences, but this should not limit or persecute the basic human rights of any gender (including transgender people) and the right to make free choices in all matters of study, work, and life. Using these involuntary differences to judge, discipline, and blame men and women or people of any other gender/gender identity is fallacious and should be criticized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So, there is so much sexism and prejudice in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, does it mean that Liu Cixin himself has such sexism and prejudice? The answer is obviously yes. Liu Cixin denied this in the interview, but his denial is not valid because it goes against the facts. In other words, even if Liu Cixin did not intentionally discriminate subjectively, she still had the essence of objective discrimination. When Liu Cixin showed off certain traits that are considered to be more prominent in women, it was obviously a discriminatory stance, rather than an attitude that needed sympathy and change, nor was it specifically intended to expose and criticize the impact of patriarchal society on women. Discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In addition, Liu Cixin once hypothesized in a debate with scholar Jiang Xiaoyuan,If the world ends and only he, Jiang Xiaoyuan and a female host are left, &quot;The three of us carry everything about human civilization, and we must eat her to survive. Will you eat it?&quot; Liu Cixin stood at the &quot;Eat it&quot; &quot;Party. Although this is largely just a hypothesis, Liu&#39;s assumption that the target was a &quot;beautiful woman&quot; (even though there was indeed a female host next to them at the time), that is, a woman, inherently implies that women will be sacrificed. Even without going into detail, this is enough to reflect Liu Cixin&#39;s certain bad psychology and value orientation towards women. Even as a joke, it&#39;s inappropriate. Moreover, Liu Cixin argued with Jiang seriously, which shows that he did not take it as a joke, but took the hypothesis seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(11) Public image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, Liu Cixin not only did not endow the people with qualities such as unity and courage, but instead gave them extremely strong belittlement and contempt. In Liu Cixin&#39;s writings, the masses are selfish, blindly obedient, weak, and barbaric, and are an out-and-out &quot;rabble.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In addition to the Red Guards&#39; criticism of Ye Zhetai mentioned above and the screams of female refugees when the earth became two-dimensional, there are also many plots that reflect the bad nature of the masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For example, Luo Ji predicted that a star would be destroyed based on the laws of the dark forest. When the incident was made public, the star fleet was destroyed. The public worshiped Luo Ji as a god-like person in order to survive the crisis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Seeing Luo Ji stop, the crowd moved towards him. Two or three meters away from him, the people in the front row tried their best to block the advance of the crowd behind him, and then knelt down. The people behind him also knelt down one after another, and the glowing The crowd dropped like waves receding from the beach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Lord, save us!&quot; Luo Ji heard someone say, and his words caused a buzzing resonance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Our God, save the world!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Great spokesperson, uphold justice in the universe!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Angel of justice, save mankind!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;钬︹€」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When Luo Ji showed his inability to solve the crisis, people&#39;s views on him and the way they treated him took a 180-degree turn:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On a cold and rainy autumn afternoon, the resident representative meeting of the fifth district of New Life made a decision: to expel Luo Ji from the community on the grounds that he had affected the normal lives of the residents in the district. During the snow project, Luo Ji often went out to attend meetings, but he still spent most of his time in the community. He kept in touch with various organizations involved in the snow project from his residence. After Luo Ji resumed his identity as a Wallfacer, the five New Life Districts were placed under martial law, affecting the lives and work of residents. Later, as Luo Ji&#39;s status declined, the martial law in the community was gradually relaxed, but the situation got worse: from time to time, people from the city gathered downstairs where Luo Ji lived, heckled and taunted him, and even shouted at him. Rocks were thrown at the windows, and the news media took an interest in the scene, often with as many reporters as protesters. But the real reason for Luo Ji&#39;s expulsion was the complete disappointment in him among the hibernators.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;钬︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Facing this man who had exhausted everything, the director showed no mercy at all. Like other people of that era, she always felt that no matter how dark the world was, ultimate justice always existed somewhere in the dark. Luo Ji first confirmed her feeling, and then ruthlessly shattered it. Angry at his disappointment, she coldly announced the meeting&#39;s decision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;钬︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Ah, he seems to be a wall-facer!&quot; Then the child&#39;s parents also turned to look at him, and he had no choice but to admit that he was Luo Ji.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At this time, &quot;Hawthorn Tree&quot; sounded in the car.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The car stopped, &quot;Get off.&quot; The child&#39;s father said coldly, and the eyes of the mother and child looking at him were as cold as the autumn rain outside.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Luo Ji didn&#39;t move. He wanted to hear the song.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Please go down.&quot; The man said again, and Luo Ji read the meaning in their eyes: It is not your fault that you have no ability to save the world, but it is an unforgivable sin to give the world hope and then shatter it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;钬︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The journey went smoothly, but more than an hour later someone recognized Luo Ji, and everyone in the car unanimously asked him to get out of the car. Luo Ji argued that he had entered his credit points to buy the ticket, so of course he had the right to ride on the bus. An old man with gray hair took out two cash coins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the already unusual cash coins were thrown at him, he was kicked out of the car.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Wall-facer, what are you doing with a shovel on your back?&quot; Someone stuck his head out of the car window and asked as the car was driving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Dig your own grave,&quot; Luo Ji said, causing a burst of laughter in the car.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wall-facer, populist, and Venezuelan President Rey Diaz was stoned to death by people who knew that he was trying to fight the Trisolarans by committing suicide when he returned to his homeland after finishing facing the wall:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Rey Diaz raised his hands in the air, and with tears in his eyes called out affectionately to the crowds of people rushing towards him: &quot;Ah, my people!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The first stone thrown by his people struck him on his raised left hand, the second hit him on the chest, and the third struck him on the forehead and knocked him down. Then, people&#39;s stones flew like raindrops, and finally almost buried his lifeless body. The last stone that hit Wallfacer Rey Diaz was thrown by an old lady. She struggled to lift a stone and walked to Rey Diaz&#39;s body and said in Spanish:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Evil man, you want to kill everyone, but there is my grandson there, and you actually want to kill my grandson!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As she spoke, she tried her best and tremblingly smashed the stone in her hand onto Ray Diaz&#39;s broken head that was exposed from the pile of stones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;There are also some details where Liu Cixin’s contempt for the public can be seen, such as this passage when Shen Yufei’s husband Wei Cheng was dictating some of his experiences:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I don’t have a good impression of the tourists and pilgrims who come here. Those tourists don’t know what they are here for, they just run around taking pictures. The pilgrims, on the other hand, generally seem to be much poorer than the tourists, and they are all in a state of numbness. Intellectually inhibited state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The most ironic thing is the following paragraph describing the pessimism and despair of mankind after the destruction of Starfleet, so a hundred thousand people gathered together for a naked sex party:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The whole square is covered with white flowers, and the white particles are squirming like a pot of boiling rice porridge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Are those all human?&quot; Luo Ji asked doubtfully.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Naked people, this is a super sex party, now over a hundred thousand people and counting.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, Liu Cixin also described some of the kindness and love of common people in this book. For example, when describing the two-dimensionalization of the solar system, there is this paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On a magnified screen pulled out by the spacecraft&#39;s A.I., a couple can be seen embracing and falling into the plane. The two-dimensional human bodies are arranged side by side on the plane. The embrace can still be seen, but the posture is very strange. Like a clumsy drawing by a child who doesn&#39;t understand the principles of perspective. There was also a mother who held her infant child high and fell into the plane. The child only lived 0.1 second longer than she did in the three-dimensional world. Their bodies were also vividly printed on this giant painting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;But such depictions are rare (this is a bit exaggerated, the only one that seems to portray the public in a positive light is the paragraph above), and most depictions of civilians are derogatory. It should also be noted that Liu Cixin&#39;s praise from the public only refers to his love for family members, not his altruism and public service in the public sphere. Although this is a statement of certain facts, it can also reflect Liu Cixin&#39;s conservative thoughts and stance (valuing the traditional family and ignoring the public sphere are typical characteristics of conservatism).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s description of the masses is in line with those academic analyzes such as &quot;The Crowd&quot; that criticize the inferiority of the masses (or &quot;the masses&quot;). There are many other literary and artistic works that express the bad nature of the public, but few are as vivid and vicious as Liu Cixin&#39;s description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These descriptions of Liu Cixin are indeed the true face of the people in many parts of the world today. In China, this inferiority of the public is more common and prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, like the previous descriptions, Liu Cixin stated the facts not with a compassionate attitude, but with pure cynicism. Liu Cixin&#39;s understanding of the public is not a profound sympathetic understanding, but a mocking understanding. This is completely different from Lu Xun&#39;s kind of strong criticism of the bad nature of the people, but full of grief, anger, sympathy, goodwill, and good intentions. The nature and direction are completely different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Another important point is that what Liu Cixin depicts is the future world, and the scene he sets is especially the human world after the &quot;Great Depression&quot; era. In many cases, it is very developed, and the people are kind and qualified. In such a society, there should be a civil society similar to that in Western developed countries, and the people should also have a certain quality of political participation. But Liu Cixin did not describe any public with civic qualities, nor did he describe civil society (only a few mentioned similar things, such as citizens throwing tomatoes at congressmen, or being derogatory). On the contrary, there are many heroic characters in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. Of course, this can also be justified by the harsh censorship environment. However, according to Liu Cixin&#39;s value orientation in this book and on other occasions, it is basically &quot;it is not impossible, it is not possible.&quot; Even without strict censorship of speech, he would still not be able to write about civil society, or in other words, he would not be able to write about the &quot;goodness&quot; of civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Liu Cixin and his &quot;Three-Body Problem&quot;: the Coexistence of Conscience Pollution and Grandeur Deep（2）</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;(Continued from Part 1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This again resonates wildly with Liu Cixin’s fans. On China’s Internet platforms, the most reviled people are 「white leftists」. Not only environmentalists and animal rights activists will be regarded as &quot;white left&quot;, but those who advocate increasing social welfare, taxing the rich, racial equality, women&#39;s rights and LGBT rights, accepting immigrants, abolition of the death penalty... will all be labeled as &quot;white left&quot; The name. Socialists regard social equality and fraternity as enemies. They believe that these policies in the name of &quot;love&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; have obliterated the value of survival of the fittest through natural selection and led to the degradation of people and society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin created the image of an extreme environmentalist and animal activist like Evans to convey the idea that the &quot;white left&quot; is causing harm to the human world. Of course, he also created Cheng Xin, a more typical &quot;white left&quot; who is very caring but prone to corruption, which will be discussed later. It is true that I am personally opposed to extreme environmentalists and animal rights activists, and cannot agree with some of the values 钬嬧€媋 nd behaviors of the so-called &quot;white left&quot;. However, Liu Cixin&#39;s deliberate exaggeration of generalizations and extreme examples to imply universality is even more disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is a quote from an ETO member in the book that is worth pondering:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;This is not a rumor!&quot; a European said loudly, pushing forward at the same time, &quot;My name is Rafael, an Israeli. Three years ago, my fourteen-year-old son encountered a car accident, and I donated the child&#39;s kidney to A Palestinian girl suffering from uremia, to express my wish for the two peoples to coexist peacefully. For this wish, I would even sacrifice my life, and many Israelis and Palestinians are also doing the same thing. I made the same sincere efforts. But it was all in vain. Our homeland was still sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of retribution. This made me lose faith in mankind and join the Trisolaran organization. Despair turned me from a pacifist to a pacifist. As an extremist, it may also be because of my huge donation to the organization that I was able to enter the core of the Adventists. Now I tell you, the Adventists have their own secret program, which is: human beings are an evil species, and human civilization They have committed a heinous crime against the earth and must be punished for it. The ultimate goal of the Adventists is to ask the Lord to carry out this divine punishment: the destruction of all mankind!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In Liu Cixin&#39;s view (or what he wants readers to think), if those who strongly pursue world peace and beauty cannot achieve such goals, they will turn to disgusting humanity and try to destroy everything out of despair and anger. Therefore, these advocates of love and The peaceful &quot;white left&quot; are essentially potential terrorists, and they can do more harm than ordinary bad guys who seek self-interest and have low morals. And some &quot;white left&quot; persistent and firm beliefs, passionate emotions, and behaviors that do not hesitate to change reality will be regarded by Liu Cixin and others as madness or a precursor to madness, as destroyers of order or outright lunacy. It should be alerted, extinguished and destroyed. As for the &quot;white leftists&quot; like Evans and Rafael who are rich and have the ability to more actively put their ideals into practice, Liu Cixin and others believe that they should be vigilant and extinguished because these people are more realistically dangerous. In the book, the tragic collective deaths of Evans and the &quot;Adventists&quot; in &quot;Operation Guzheng&quot; revealed Liu&#39;s resentment towards the &quot;White Left&quot;. Even though Liu Cixin does not believe that Bai Zuo will destroy the world, he believes that Bai Zuo&#39;s various behaviors and tendencies will eventually objectively lead to the destruction of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course this is not the case for the &quot;white left&quot; in the real world, or at least most of them are not like this. Although there are many left-wingers who go to extremes, they are very marginalized, such as the Japanese Red Army, Red Brigades, ETA, and some particularly extreme (especially violent) environmental and animal rights activists who resort to violence for their extreme ideals. , completely cannot represent the mainstream left that advocates transformationalism, love and peace above all else. As for the &quot;left&quot; or idealistic radicals like Marxism-Leninism-Mao, their values 钬嬧€媋 nd behaviors are obviously very different from the &quot;white left&quot; described by Liu Cixin, and there is no comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, the mainstream left will indeed be disappointed and even despair after being unable to solve the ugliness of human beings after continuous efforts, and will also breed a mood of &quot;just destroy the world&quot;, but this mood does not mean that they will really choose this in reality. . Just like when you have conflicts with others or encounter grievances, it is normal for you to want to kill the other person or break the relationship for a certain period of time (or just a thought for a few seconds), but most of them will calm down and it is impossible to actually practice it. . Just like Lu Xun often made ugly and despairing remarks about human nature, and also said, &quot;If you don&#39;t explode in silence, you will perish in silence.&quot; But does he really want people to destroy the world? No, on the contrary, he is calling on people to firmly pursue truth, goodness, beauty, fairness and justice. The &quot;white left&quot; are generally very concerned about the issue of climate warming and preventing its deterioration. If they really want to destroy mankind out of despair and think the world is dirty, or feel that the destruction of mankind is not a pity, then they should advocate giving up saving climate warming in order to expect some The land will be submerged in the next year, and the high temperature will heat humans to death. Moreover, with the development of the times and social progress, the left or &quot;white left&quot; has become more and more moderate. After some extreme attempts failed in the 20th century, they now choose a more eclectic and rational way to solve problems, without seeking absolute perfection. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(6) Dark Forest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;The Law of the Dark Forest&quot; is the theme of Liu Cixin&#39;s second part of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and directly expresses his socialist philosophy. The so-called &quot;dark forest&quot; means that people (or the entire human civilization) are in a limited and dark space, and there is a life-and-death competition between people (or planets and planets). In order to compete for living space and eliminate potential threats, these people (planets) are trying their best to get rid of or conquer each other. He also highlighted the &quot;Dark Forest Law&quot; by describing star fleets fighting among themselves to compete for resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s dark forest theory is obviously not mainly to explain the relationship between planets, but to metaphorically refer to the relationship between people, ethnic groups, and countries. Although Liu Cixin once denied this in an interview with him, he did not mean what he said. The content described and the values 钬嬧€媝 romoted by Liu Cixin in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; are all metaphors for the real world and human society, rather than science fiction for the sake of science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Values 钬嬧€媗 ike Liu Cixin&#39;s, which pit different people or groups against each other, regard competition as a zero-sum game, and believe that only by annihilating or conquering the other party can one be safe, are different from those that prevailed around the world from two or three centuries ago to the middle of the last century (and were once popular in China). Social Darwinism, which is popular among academic circles, has a lot in common. In today&#39;s world, although this theory is no longer publicly recognized in temples, it is popular everywhere. From Russia to India, from Nigeria to Indonesia, socialist trends of thought exist in the form of nationalism and populism. In China, it generally exists in the form of respecting power and institutions, discriminating and bullying the weak among compatriots, and is closer to the true nature of social Darwinism: bullying of the weak and survival of the fittest. For example, Zhihu, a forum where China&#39;s elite groups gather, is a stronghold of socialism and a gathering place for fans of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and Liu Cixin himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The fundamental flaw of the &quot;Dark Forest Law&quot; is that it ignores mutual assistance and cooperation between people or groups of people, spreads civilized goodwill, ignores the existence of moral, right and wrong, and humanitarian factors, and ignores the possibility that there will be better values 钬嬧€嬧€嬧€媋 nd ways to improve the status quo in the future. possibility (Liu even strongly opposes this improvement in the book, for reasons that will be mentioned in the next section), ignores the necessity of pursuing humanity, equality, and mutual trust, and treats interpersonal, interethnic, and international relations as completely inhumane The cold and naked interest relationship replaces the rationality and sensibility of human nature with mechanistic rationality, which is not completely consistent with the reality of interpersonal, inter-ethnic and international relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, I do not mean to deny that there are games, confrontations or even zero-sum aspects in interpersonal, inter-ethnic and international relations, nor do I deny that there is widespread intrigue, insidiousness and violence in relevant relations (even on the contrary, I am quite sure that these exist, and Its dominant role in human social relations in history and reality). Typical examples include the nuclear deterrence between the United States, the Soviet Union, India, Pakistan and other countries, as well as among the world&#39;s nuclear powers, which is the realistic version of &quot;dark forest deterrence&quot;. In real life, there are also situations where various parties, from officials to ordinary employees, hold each other&#39;s &quot;dark materials&quot; to threaten each other. There are often gains and losses in games and struggles between people based on strength, unknowns, scheming, etc. It can be said that many situations in the &quot;dark forest&quot; have already occurred between countries, groups, and people on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, this is not all, just a part and an aspect. More importantly, evil is a reality, but it does not mean that it is reasonable and should be, let alone that such evil should be promoted. Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; amplifies this aspect into all social relations, and affirms it as the basis of survival and the criterion of game, and implies that only by being so evil, losing humanity and abandoning warmth can human civilization be preserved. This is poisoning people&#39;s hearts, destroying goodwill and trust, stopping people from exploring a more reasonable way to resolve disputes and living life, and leading people really into a social environment guided by the dark forest law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, we cannot deny the objective existence of this situation and cannot abandon the necessity of using chips to retain deterrence capabilities. This is indeed the nest of the &quot;dark forest&quot;, but we cannot completely escape from this reality. Only flowers protected by swords and shields can bloom for a long time. However, we should not get completely lost and indulged in this &quot;dark forest&quot;-style social relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(7) The two periods after the Great Trough to the destruction of Starfleet and the late Deterrence Era&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These two years were described by Liu Cixin as very beautiful, with abundant material resources, social harmony, and full respect for human rights and freedoms. For example, a highly humanized lifestyle brought about by full automation and digitalization; condemnation and termination of human rights violations, abuse of power, and lack of supervision caused by the &quot;Wall-Facing Project&quot;; financial compensation can be obtained for accidents in life; banks Provide generous and huge deposit interest for hibernators... In short, let people live comfortably and with dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, all of this is an attempt to suppress the situation, or to pave the way for the tragedy that will follow. At this time in Liu&#39;s writing, people have become overconfident in human civilization, and as a result, they have developed too much sympathy and empathy, and have lost their vigilance and crisis awareness, which ultimately led to the subsequent destruction of the Starfleet and the The agony of human despair before the Era of Deterrence. The depiction of the later era of deterrence (when deterrence fails) is also similar. Here are some typical paragraphs for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Before the Starfleet came into contact with the &quot;water droplets&quot; sent by Trisolaris, there was this description:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;The public&#39;s feelings towards Trisolaris have begun to shift from hostility and hatred to sympathy, pity and even admiration. People are also aware of the fact that the ten water drops of Trisolaris were emitted two centuries ago, and humans have not until now Only then can we truly understand their meaning. This is certainly because the behavior of the Trisolaran civilization is too implicit, but also reflects the mentality of human beings distorted by their own bloody history. In the global online referendum, the support rate of the Sunshine Project It has risen sharply, and more and more people are leaning toward using Mars as a strong survival option for Trisolaran settlement.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;This passage reflects the fundamental change in mankind&#39;s views on the Three-Body Problem and the Three-Body World after the end of the Great Trough and the &quot;Second Enlightenment/Renaissance/Great Revolution&quot; and &quot;giving civilization to the years.&quot; The reason for this transformation is precisely the product of its own material wealth, military power, and ideological civilization. The changes in the human condition and the re-civilization of society have turned humans from fear, hostility and high vigilance towards the Trisolaran world to one of sympathy and compassion. The human mentality at this time was in sharp contrast to the despair that occurred later when the interstellar fleet was almost completely annihilated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Take this description of the attitude of officials at a government meeting in Shi Qiang&#39;s region as an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;This was a meeting of the community government. District administrative officials were present. About two-thirds were hibernators, and the rest were modern humans. They can now be clearly distinguished: although they are all in an extremely depressed state, the hibernators The former officials maintained their normalcy in a low mood, while modern people showed more or less signs of collapse. Since the beginning of the meeting, their emotions had been out of control many times, and Shi Xiaoming&#39;s words once again touched their fragile nerves. The chief executive of the district covered his face with tears and started crying again, causing several other modern officials to cry with him; the official in charge of regional education laughed hysterically, and one modern man roared in pain, Throwing the cup on the ground...&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;This is true even for officials, let alone common people. Later, there are descriptions of tens of thousands of people engaging in collective fornication and Luo Ji being first worshiped and then expelled, etc., which reflects the despair of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The ups and downs of human mentality from despair to confidence and then to despair are saddening. The &quot;compassion&quot; for the Trisolaran world when we were confident has also become a huge joke, a cruel irony that humans have placed on themselves. He speculated on his opponent with good intentions, but ended up facing destruction. The destruction of the Earth Fleet was largely due to human beings&#39; underestimation and credulity. This kind of credulity also comes from the fact that people have lived in civilization for a long time, have lost their vigilance to the dangers of the universe, and think that their enemies are too beautiful and benevolent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s satire on human beings who are kind but deceived and whose good intentions lead to disasters does not end here. On the contrary, the human beings in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; have repeated such a tragedy since then, which is the period of history that occurred in the later period of the Deterrence Era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After the destruction of the Earth fleet and the remaining fleets killing each other, mankind was already in despair and was just waiting for the earth to be invaded and mankind to perish without being able to reproduce. However, scientist and wall-facer Luo Ji cleverly used the &quot;Snow Project&quot; to set up a system that transmits the location of the solar system and the Trisolaran galaxy to the universe, and successfully forced Trisolaran to give up its invasion of the Earth. After that, the Trisolaran and the Earth reached a peace agreement. The Earth and the Trisolaran transferred their advanced knowledge to each other, allowing the Earth to set up several deterrence systems that can launch &quot;spells&quot; that can lead to strikes in the dark forest. The two sides achieved a similar &quot;nuclear deterrence&quot; &quot;balance. Humanity finally turned the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, after deterrence was established and security returned, humans became &quot;restless&quot; again. Cheng Xin hibernated in AD 61 and woke up in 61 AD. When she woke up, she saw someone on TV denouncing Luo Ji for being involved in the &quot;crime of world genocide.&quot; Immediately afterwards, she was embraced by the public as the &quot;sword bearer&quot;. One of the reasons why the public supports her is that they are afraid of a ruthless sword holder like Luo Ji, and they are afraid of the absolute power that Luo Ji represents:&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Luo Ji&#39;s image changed from a savior day by day to an unreasonable monster and a tyrant who destroyed the world.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. People have shifted from focusing on solving basic survival problems to focusing on human rights and opposing totalitarian rule. Therefore, it is necessary to replace people like Luo Ji (not to mention &quot;barbaric&quot; AD people like Wade and Cao Bin) and choose a kind-hearted woman like Cheng Xin who represents love and peace to take on this deterrence task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As this description says:&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Look, she is the Virgin Mary, she really is!&quot; the young mother shouted to the crowd, then turned to Cheng Xin, clasping her hands with tears in her eyes, &quot;Beautiful and kind-hearted Virgin, protect this world, don&#39;t let those barbaric monsters Bloody men destroy everything beautiful.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;People have forgotten the tragedy of the destruction of the Earth Fleet, and the pursuit of beauty and kindness once again exceeds the importance of survival and safety. After the handover between the old and new sword holders, Luo Ji was also arrested for the crime of &quot;world genocide&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Just fifteen minutes after Cheng Xin held the button to emit the gravitational wave signal that should be emitted as a deterrent in the event of an invasion from the Trisolaran world, the Trisolaran &quot;water droplet&quot; pounced on the transmitter. Unable to face the consequences of the destruction of the two planets, Cheng Xin gave up on launching the gravitational wave signal that would lead to the exposure and destruction of the two galaxies. The invasion of the Three-Body Problem was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, people who showed up for a long time did not show any particular panic. When Trisolaris asked people to immigrate to Australia, there was no response.&lt;strong&gt;「Until this time, people still imagined a peaceful life for at least one generation, so after Tomoko&#39;s speech was published, no country responded, and no one started to immigrate. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;Human beings still had an ostrich mentality of taking chances. It wasn&#39;t until &quot;water droplets&quot; hit several cities, killing more than 300,000 people, that people began to migrate in fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, people&#39;s luck mentality has not been completely shattered. People also believe what Tomoko said,&lt;strong&gt;&quot;After the Trisolaran fleet arrives, it is fully capable of enabling the four billion people in Australia to live a comfortable life. At the same time, the occupiers will also help humans build living spaces on Mars and in space. Five years after the fleet arrives, it will be able to send people to Mars and large-scale space immigration will be basically completed in fifteen years. By then, humans will have a relatively large enough living space, and the two civilizations will start a new peaceful life in the solar system.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, the Trisolaran World does not give humans a chance to survive. Instead, it gradually destroys humans&#39; ability to resist and survive. Destroy Australian industry and infrastructure as people disarm and emigrate. Then, they cut off electricity and agricultural production capacity and forced &quot;people to eat each other.&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Tomoko looked around at all the people in the hall, &quot;Food?&quot; Isn’t this all food? Everyone, look around you. There is food, living food. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;Only then did human beings know what a life-and-death struggle was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This passage from Sophon&#39;s mouth can reflect Liu Cixin&#39;s views on human survival issues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Survival is inherently a kind of luck. This was true on the earth in the past, and it is true everywhere in this cold universe now. But I don&#39;t know since when, human beings have an illusion that survival has become something within easy reach. This is you The root cause of failure. The flag of evolution will rise again in this world, and you will fight for survival. I hope everyone here is among the last 50 million people. I hope you can eat food instead of Eaten by grain.」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The process of human ups and downs described by Liu Cixin is shocking. The compassion he depicts when humans are safe and happy, the relaxation of vigilance, the despair and madness of humans when they are on the verge of extinction, and the ingenious design of the Three-Body Problem to push humans into extinction step by step, all reflect the weaknesses of human nature. For example, the process of human beings being exterminated by the Three-Body Plan in Australia (the attempted extinction), and the process including the Roman massacre of Carthage and the Jingkang disaster (the Jin army conquered Kaifeng) 锛夈€乀 he processes of the Nanjing Massacre and other massacres are quite similar (you can read the relevant accounts and compare them. Perhaps Liu Cixin wrote similar plots in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; after reading these accounts). This all reflects Liu Cixin’s profound understanding and vivid interpretation of human nature, human psychology, and the cruelty of the struggle for survival in human history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In this section, I have quite a positive opinion of Liu Cixin. But this article is mainly for criticism, and of course this paragraph also needs criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In fact, the above content is the continuation and embodiment of Liu Cixin’s dark forest theory. Liu Cixin&#39;s descriptions and analyzes are indeed profound and consistent with part of human history and reality. However, as said before (and will be said many times later), while Liu Cixin accurately depicts a certain dark fact, he rationalizes this darkness, hints or even expresses the unchangeable nature of this reality, conveying A value that can survive only by giving up kindness and compassion and choosing cruelty and viciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The same facts and principles, with different emotional tendencies and description emphasis, can lead to different conclusions and achieve completely different goals. Based on Liu Cixin&#39;s description between the lines, as well as the whole book and even his personal words and deeds on other occasions, it is enough to draw the conclusion that he advocates abandoning goodwill, treating people with evil, using deceit and cruelty in interpersonal, ethnic, international relations and competitive matters. . In addition, he also wanted to express or imply other things, which will be discussed later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When describing this part of the content, there is also an intriguing passage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Some scholars believe that science and technology were once one of the forces that eliminated totalitarianism, but when a crisis threatens the survival of civilization, science and technology may become the soil for the birth of new totalitarianism. In traditional totalitarianism, dictators can only be controlled through other people. Achieving rule faces low efficiency and countless uncertain factors. Therefore, in human history, a 100% dictatorship system has never appeared. But technology has made it possible for the realization of this super dictatorship. Wall-facers and persistence Swordsmen are worrying examples. The combination of super technology and super crisis may push human society back to the Dark Ages.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is difficult to judge what Liu Cixin actually meant by this statement. According to Liu Cixin&#39;s usual political views, he is not opposed to totalitarianism in China today. However, the situation described in this passage is very similar to the reality in China in the past ten years. This passage accurately discusses the evolution of the relationship between technology and totalitarianism. When the Internet emerged, people thought it would break the information blockade and promote freedom and democracy. However, now technological totalitarianism and digital totalitarianism have been established in many countries, including China, and even democratic countries cannot escape the specter of surveillanceism. The high-intensity control that authoritarian countries such as China are using technology to carry out during the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the centralized and digital management that countries must adopt to curb climate warming in the future, are both highly consistent with Liu Cixin’s words that 「threaten the survival of civilization.」 When a crisis occurs, technology may become the soil for the birth of a new totalitarianism.&quot; So does Liu Cixin agree with this kind of technological totalitarianism? This is a question that is not easy to judge, or Liu does not simply agree or disagree with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(8) Thomas Wade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The creation of this character best reflects Liu Cixin&#39;s social Darwinism thoughts, and can also give a glimpse of Liu Cixin&#39;s standards for judging human quality and value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Thomas Vader&#39;s first words after appearing on the scene were shocking enough:&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Would you sell your mother to a brothel?&quot; Wade asked&lt;/strong&gt;(Ask Cheng Xin). Through this shocking sentence and side description, the image of a cold and cruel intelligence agent is portrayed, and it also reveals Vader&#39;s sinister character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;To achieve the goal by any means is a typical feature of social Darwinism. Liu Cixin said it powerfully through the words of Wade:&lt;strong&gt;He suddenly changed his usual calm and cold tone and roared like a mad beast, &quot;Forward! Forward!! Forward by any means necessary!!!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When the plan to send humans to contact the Trisolaran world was blocked due to carrying weight restrictions, Vader said coldly, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Just send the brain&lt;/strong&gt;」銆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is also this side description:&lt;strong&gt;&quot;There were two male prisoners who were obviously from AD, and Cheng Xin whistled frivolously, but when they saw the person Cheng Xin was looking for, they immediately became more serious, and they all hurriedly lowered their heads to work, as if they were a little afraid of what they had just done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The first time Cheng Xin saw this man (Vade), she knew that he had not given up. His ambitions and ideals, his insidiousness, and many other things that Cheng Xin had never known before, he had not given up on anything. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, these alone cannot fully portray Vader&#39;s ruthlessness. Liu Cixin still has more words to describe Wade. But just from these few sentences, people can understand what kind of character, image, and characteristics Vader is. Characters like Vader are not just literary figures, there are also similar real people in reality. From leaders of a country to local powerful men and gang leaders, to even ruthless and capable figures in schools and workplaces, they all fit in with certain aspects or even the entire image of Vader. When ordinary people come into contact with such a person, they will inevitably break out in cold sweat on their chest, back, head and feet, and will unconsciously become afraid of him. Even people with some spirit and ability will shrink a bit in front of such a vicious person. If you are not afraid of him at first, then after he performs some tricks on you, you will be more afraid of him than ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, characters like Vader portrayed by Liu Cixin are the saviors of mankind, or at least one of the saviors. Vader not only promoted the Ladder Plan and sent Yun Tianming&#39;s brain to the Trisolaran world, but most importantly, he researched the light speed spacecraft, allowing humans to retain the fire of life. And if it hadn&#39;t been for the &quot;destruction&quot; caused by Cheng Xin, Vader and others would have been able to bring humanity out of the danger of being two-dimensionalized, and even the Trisolaris would not have been able to break through and threaten the earth in the first place. All subsequent disasters would have will not happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin endowed a devil-like figure with angelic saving power precisely because he wanted to express what he said through Wade&#39;s mouth&lt;strong&gt;&quot;If you lose your humanity, you will lose a lot; if you lose your bestiality, you will lose everything&quot;, and &quot;advance by any means necessary&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;Or to combine the two sentences, it means that only by unscrupulous means and regardless of human nature and human rights can we win. If we care about morality and means and are bound by human nature and human rights, we can only fail. This is a typical view of Social Darwinism, or not only a view of Social Darwinism, but the most sinister aspect of Social Darwinism, that is, evil must triumph over good, and only by eliminating good and promoting evil can we survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This point is shown many times in Liu Cixin&#39;s The Three-Body Problem, and the depiction of Wade is a concentrated expression of this point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So, is this view correct? If we look at the history of mankind and even all things, this is indeed an objective reality to a large extent. Let’s not talk about anything else but human beings. In history, are there more examples of barbarism defeating civilization, or are there more examples of civilization destroying barbarism? Undoubtedly the former. Exquisite Athens perished at the hands of capable Sparta, Rome perished at the hands of barbarian invasions, and the Song and Ming dynasties perished at the hands of the Jin, Yuan, and Manchu Qing dynasties. These are all well-known examples. Even those self-proclaimed civilizations have indeed created the power of civilization. Isn&#39;t their rise and glory based on barbarism, cruelty and unscrupulous means? For ancient Rome, the treacherous massacre of the Carthaginians after they disarmed was the key to its domination of the Mediterranean; Li Shimin struck preemptively (of course, some historical data see it as a &quot;self-defense counterattack,&quot; but...) and launched the Xuanwu The Gate Incident killed Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji and his descendants, which led to the later Zhenguan rule of &quot;Tian Khan&quot;. In addition to these magnificent histories, how many examples are there in the market that &quot;good people don&#39;t live long, and bad people do harm for thousands of years&quot;? &quot;Despicability is the passport of the despicable, and nobility is the epitaph of the noble.&quot; Someone has long made an incisive and profound summary of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Therefore, what Liu Cixin said through Wade&#39;s mouth is indeed reality to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But reality does not mean what is right or what should be. On the contrary, the development of human civilization to this day has been achieved precisely through the lashing of barbarism and the overcoming of ugliness. Without criticism and restraint of evil, human beings would still attack each other day after day, and beheadings, amputations, and gunfire would still be commonplace, and it would be impossible for human beings to bask in relative peace and development. It is the persistence of countless people that allows evil to be restricted and compressed step by step. At least great evils and disasters only unfortunately happen to a small number of people in a small number of areas, while most people can live their lives in relative peace and tranquility. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Therefore, we can only &quot;abandon&quot; the extreme socialist views hinted and even promoted by Liu Cixin in The Three-Body Problem (yes, it is extreme socialist rather than ordinary socialist). We know its reality but must also curb its reality. After realizing the horror of unscrupulous means, we must stick to conscience and rationality to restrain the growth of ugliness and the rebirth of cruelty. Even if we are the products left by evil, we should not continue evil to survive. Just like to a certain extent, we are all the descendants of various acts of rape (or, to be precise, non-consensual sex) from ancient times to modern times (who dares to say that all of their ancestors were the product of consensual sexual intercourse?), we are all rapes Descendants of the crime, but we certainly should not praise rape, but resolutely criticize and despise it. The live human experiments conducted by Japan&#39;s Unit 731 and Nazi Germany have achieved great medical and scientific research results, and have benefited mankind today, but this cannot be whitewashed, beautified, justified or rationalized. , let alone allow similar atrocities to happen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin is not (or at least will not publicly admit to being) a proponent of extreme socialism, but objectively he undoubtedly implies or even expresses such a value orientation and value choice. Different from many literary and artistic works in Europe, the United States and even China that depict darkness and bad guys&#39; unscrupulous tactics, which are meant to lash out ugliness and praise justice, Liu&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; depicts darkness and unscrupulous tactics while doing everything possible to rationalize and even praise and express them. It is a tragic, great, and only understandable value and practice for the continuation of human survival and development. This is worthy of vigilance and criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Regarding Liu’s socialist values, I will criticize them later, but now I will return to my comments on Weide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s portrayal of the character Wade is also very positive. Although he depicts so many evil and sinister aspects of this man, he does so to highlight the greatness of his purpose, the correctness of his direction, and the legitimacy of his actions. Moreover, everything Vader does as described by Liu Cixin is not for Vader himself, but is related to the future and destiny of mankind. Vader has become a person who cannot be said to be &quot;not self-interested&quot; but is clearly &quot;benefiting mankind&quot; and not &quot; He is a heroic figure who is &quot;righteous&quot; but obviously &quot;clean on both sleeves&quot;. Everything he does is not for personal gain but for the public interest. Moreover, such a hero is feared by others, but he never bows to any pressure, and is not afraid to flatter anyone or even alien creatures (for example, he speaks boldly when being monitored by sophons and everyone is cautious, but deliberately takes advantage of this surveillance. ), is an out-and-out hero. This makes all his &quot;anti-humanity&quot; and &quot;anti-human rights&quot; actions look more just, selfless and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But in reality, is a person like Wade really always upright, persistent, determined, and hard-core? From some aspects or on the surface, this is indeed the case. The people I mentioned above, from the head of state to the gang leader, to the ruthless people in the school unit, are often majestic, quite powerful, capable, and fearless. But the vast majority of them (unless they are truly invincible) are often more groveling than ordinary people when facing someone who is more &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;awesome&quot;, because they know better than ordinary people how terrible their own kind is. You can&#39;t offend those who are stronger than you. In the face of the system, although they sometimes make provocative and rebellious actions to show their strength and power to others or just for their own comfort, more often they obey the system, flatter the system, and act against those with coercive power. There is an unusual piety to the systems and rules that underlie it. Because they know that the energy of the system is infinite, which individuals can use but cannot overturn. They are by no means rigid and arrogant towards anyone or anything, but because of their personality traits and survival needs, they are more bullying and fearful of the hard, adapt to the situation, and are refined and self-interested than ordinary people. People like Beria and Goering don&#39;t look like Vader? What kind of moral character did they have in front of Stalin and Hitler (of course they changed their moral character before the latter died)? Faced with the evil system and environment, will they rebel and confront, or will they submit and take advantage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, even if Thomas Vader becomes (represents) a supreme leader or dictator (rather than a thug) like Stalin, Mao Zedong, Hitler, and Putin, is he really pure and brave? According to various information now disclosed, they are often far more frightened and weak than the leaders of democratic countries. For example, Stalin showed fear when Germany invaded and before his death, and it was not true that he would never fall down even if he died. Although the movie &quot;The Death of Stalin&quot; is a bit dramatic, the facts reflected are basically correct. And what about Mao Zedong? Li Zhisui&#39;s disclosure is not an isolated evidence, but can be verified with information from multiple parties, and the sincerity of the record has been affirmed by well-known mainstream scholars such as Li Anyou. This &quot;tough guy&quot; can also be seen in Putin&#39;s behavior after his failed invasion of Ukraine. The image of Thomas Wade created by Liu Cixin is actually similar to the superficial images of these dictators, such as fortitude and courage, but he deliberately avoids the inner weakness and fear of such people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, are people like Wade really honest, selfless, and dedicated to their ideals? There are indeed such people, but they are rare. The vast majority of people who think and act like them have no less desires than ordinary people, and their abilities and means are enough to obtain more illegal benefits. How can they live clean in power, money, and beauty like Liu Xiahui? Let’s take those sanctimonious and ruthless top leaders of the Burundi Party and Nazis, such as Yagoda and Goebbels, as examples. If you look at the history books and memoirs about them, you will know that they are more dirty and blatant than the dirty people who can be seen at a glance. People who are greedy are even more greedy (of course in comparison, the Bolsheviks are more inconsistent and shamelessly greedy than the Nazis). Will they make sacrifices for the people? Maybe it will happen at some point in time, but it will definitely be after he is greedy for pleasure and uses various methods to benefit himself at the expense of others to make sacrifices. It will never be as tragic a sacrifice as in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. The collapse of the Nazis and the Soviet Union and the revelation of the inside story also proved that what they sacrificed to defend was not something worthwhile, but something downright dirty. In other words, people like Tojo Hideki and Nogi Nogi are indeed selfless, but they earned their &quot;selflessness&quot; and their devotion to Japan with the lives of tens of millions of Chinese, Americans, Russians/Soviets. The &quot;greatness&quot; of man. Do we want such people? (The most important thing is that this kind of dedication and survival is not the only way in this world)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But Liu Cixin did not describe these. Instead, he described Wade and the previous Shi Qiang as very honest, devoid of desires, not afraid, and not flattering. Of course, this can be said to be because their conduct is not the focus of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, so there is no need to write about their greed, fear, and flattery. Therefore, a cruel and cruel figure like Vader appears to be very great to mankind, and an image like Shi Qiang appears imperfect but more complete and real. If Liu Cixin writes about these people being greedy, fearful, and flattering, his good image will collapse and he will lose the set of moral conduct that Liu Cixin and the socialists think the characters should have (at least on the surface). They can no longer create the ideal hero in their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is again the way historical figures are described in today’s Chinese propaganda system. In the past, that is, the &quot;first thirty years&quot;, especially the ten years of the Cultural Revolution, all important figures and positive figures were presented in a &quot;great and upright&quot; image, without any flaws (at most, they would have a somewhat approachable description). But now it is different. For those great men, heroes, and positive figures, we will deliberately highlight some of their wild, unruly, low-quality, poor knowledge and other characteristics, but at the same time, we will never &quot;smear&quot; the &quot;major issues&quot; involving fundamental integrity. In this way Make the positive image more humane, real, and flesh-and-blood. But this kind of humanization, realness, and flesh and blood actually avoids many more important facts of evil and even crime. It uses small &quot;flaws&quot; to cover up the real filth and filth, and uses dramatic naughtiness to overcome the bloody situation. Outright brutality. I mentioned this kind of depiction earlier in this article when it came to &quot;Mao Zedong&#39;s Instructions.&quot; Liu&#39;s depiction of characters like Weide and Shi Qiang is in the same vein, as are his attitudes and motivations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Characters like Wade portrayed by Liu Cixin, and other related descriptions and narratives, all reinforce the ideas of &quot;advancing by any means necessary&quot; and &quot;losing beastliness and losing everything&quot;. Liu is not only describing an objective fact, but also giving subjective approval and praise. This is the biggest difference between him and other masterpieces of literature handed down from ancient times, and it is also the most worthy of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, as mentioned before, the characters like Wade and Shi Qiang depicted by Liu Cixin represent the violent machines of the ruling institutions (or one of them) and are the defenders of the system, not Lin Chong and Yang. Rebels of the system like Zhi Zhi and Lu Zhishen, and those who oppose the state’s violent machine. In &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, Liu Cixin criticized Ye Wenjie and other victims and rebels, but he did not hesitate to praise the defenders of the human order. This can also reflect Liu Cixin&#39;s conservative nature and the conservative stance of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; . They are indeed social Darwinists, but their social Darwinism is not for change, but for the purpose of making the old order more stable. This further demonstrates the ugliness and reactionary nature of Liu Cixin and the values 钬嬧€媜 f &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What is very ironic is that Liu Cixin and &quot;Three-Body&quot;&#39;s conservative reaction to defend the system and the old order is in sharp contrast to the anti-traditional and anti-order ideas held by Mao Zedong that they praised. Liu Cixin has repeatedly praised Mao Zedong (or at least mentioned it without being disparaging and critical) in her books and interviews. Mao Zedong’s crimes are too numerous to list, and the Cultural Revolution was an unprecedented catastrophe. However, there is one redeeming feature, which is his resistance to systemic oppression and his rebellion against traditional order and ideology (although this process and subsequent establishment of a bad system and more tyrannical The order has also resulted in more cruel oppression, but after all, it is a rebellion and rebellion against the unreasonable and even ugly old rules, orders, and orthodoxies), a spirit of resistance that breaks the shackles of the old nest. This can be said to be the only bright spot in the brutal Cultural Revolution during the Mao era. Liu Cixin has repeatedly lauded Mao Zedong and cleared away the perpetrators of the Cultural Revolution and related systems and organizations, but it runs counter to Maoism and the only admirable thing about the Cultural Revolution. It can be seen how &quot;coincidentally&quot; it is completely contrary to the trend of humanitarianism and progress. How highly consistent with the ugly reactionary conservatism.&lt;/p&gt;

Its success is not only that Chinese works have historically won the Hugo Award, the highest award in the world of science fiction, but also that it has illuminated, inspired and announced a generation of Chinese people (or at least a large group of a certain type of Chinese people) in the world. (a specific period of time) has achieved a broad and deep resonance among Chinese people, especially young people. The author Liu Cixin has also become a super idol among fans of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, and his worship and maintenance have reached a level that is unmatched by any other contemporary writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have read &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; many times myself, and I can basically read it without missing a word or neglecting any plot, and I was deeply impressed. I also have a limited but relatively sufficient understanding of the author Liu Cixin’s background, remarks, and values. The relevant conclusions should be mentioned at the end of this article, but I don’t know when this article will be completed, and I need to give a rough evaluation first. Therefore, I will first make an overall evaluation of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and Liu Cixin at the beginning of this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The book &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is a sci-fi story about the struggle between humans and alien civilizations. It reflects some essential characteristics of human nature and human society, as well as reflections on the history and reality of humans and even the universe, and predictions of the future. It has rich literary content. , scientific and philosophical thinking, showing the author&#39;s profound insight, imagination, and powerful ability to construct, metaphor and express what he reveals through science fiction. However, the work and the author&#39;s emotional tendencies and implied value orientation are generally social Darwinism, non-sympathetic, non-human and non-philanthropic, and depreciate progressivism and social justice. The author&#39;s personal character and moral integrity are also very problematic. The quality of this work can be ranked among the thousands of literary works of great value, inspiration and influence in the world from ancient times to the present. However, the values 钬嬧€嬧€嬧€媡 hat it implies and guides, the moral values 钬嬧€嬧€嬧€媋 nd the humanistic spirit it contains are completely incomparable with those By comparison, it is even said to be a negative and harmful moral and humanistic value. This is my rough evaluation. More specific evaluations will be written in the middle and at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is vast and densely packed with details, so naturally I cannot recapitulate it here. Therefore, I write this book review on the assumption that the reviewer has read The Three-Body Problem in its entirety. However, I will still include some background and plot introduction in the review, such as quoting the original text of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, so that this article can be understood by those who have not read (at least not read it carefully) &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. For the convenience of writing, I will order the characters and events in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; in the order they are mentioned in the book, use these characters and events as units to discuss and analyze, and provide appropriate summary and review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I will make a lot of comments on the emotions and motivations of Liu Cixin&#39;s writing content in the article. Of course, this kind of judgment cannot have &quot;conclusive&quot; evidence in the legal sense. Instead, it relies heavily on speculation and association. Moreover, this kind of judgment cannot be 100% consistent with Liu Cixin&#39;s original intention, and no one has such ability, unless someone can detect what Liu Cixin is thinking in his brain. There are also many judgments based on the objective influence and reader response of Liu Cixin and his &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. The meaning expressed by a work largely depends on the meaning considered by the mainstream among readers who have the right to express freely (especially when the author has the ability to deny it but does not deny it, or denies it but does not follow logic). The relationship between the author and the readers, the work and the response is an interactive relationship, rather than a one-way infusion of meaning. The author should also consider what impact it will have when writing, including what he thinks is a &quot;misreading.&quot; Therefore, I will use its recognition and influence on readers to infer the content and emotions of Liu Cixin in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. This is not to intentionally wrong him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, as a critical article, this article is of course mainly focused on criticism. Even if I agree with some of Liu Cixin’s views, I will not mention them in a large space. It won’t take much effort to deal with some of the less controversial characters created by Liu Cixin (or at least I don’t think there is any particular need to criticize), such as Zhang Beihai, Luo Ji and others, as well as some events and plots that have no special symbolic meaning. pen and ink. Most of what I write is the objectionable part. On the whole, as mentioned above, I praise his &quot;ability&quot; to criticize his &quot;virtue&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(1) Shi Qiang&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The first character to appear in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is the scientist Wang Miao, but the first character to be portrayed in detail is the policeman Shi Qiang who comes to interview Wang Miao. In just a few pages, a rough, savage, and invasive character is portrayed. Fans who are familiar with &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; will certainly know that the description of Shi Qiang in the opening chapter and similar descriptions in the following are all foreshadowing Shi Qiang&#39;s shrewdness, courage, and sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Or to be more precise, Liu Cixin deliberately linked cunning and stubbornness with competence and responsibility, implying that characters with gangster habits are often &quot;cold on the outside and hot on the inside&quot; and are essentially good people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By excerpting the description of Shi Qiang in the novel, we can see what kind of values 钬嬧€婰 iu Cixin wants to express and try to instill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At the beginning of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, when Shi Qiang and Wang Miao met:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(Wang Miao said) &quot;&#39;Science Frontier&#39; is an academic organization that is very influential in the international academic community, and its members are all famous scholars. Why can&#39;t I get in touch with such a legitimate academic organization?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Look at you!&quot; Shi Qiang said loudly, &quot;Did we say it&#39;s illegal? Did we say we wouldn&#39;t let you come into contact with it?&quot; As he spoke, the smoke he had just inhaled was sprayed into Wang Miao&#39;s face. superior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;钬︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;I have the right not to answer, so please do as you please.&quot; Wang Miao said and turned to go back to the house.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Wait!&quot; Shi Qiang said sternly, waving to the young police officer next to him, &quot;Give him his address and phone number, and go for a walk in the afternoon.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And it was this person who, when Wang Miao was almost committed suicide after being hit by the illusion created by the Trisolarans, he used a clever method to encourage Wang Miao to have the courage to live, and cheered up to participate in the crackdown on the Earth Trisolaran organization. (ETO) conspiracy. Later, Shi Qiang also made a clever plan (namely &quot;Operation Guzheng&quot;) to ambush Evans and the &quot;Judgment Day&quot;, and rescued and protected another scientist Luo Ji many times, which can be said to be a great contribution. In addition, Liu Cixin also described Shi Qiang&#39;s deep friendship with Wang Miao and Luo Ji. It was with Shi Qiang&#39;s encouragement that Wang Miao regained the courage to live, and helped the government and military police solve a series of crimes committed by the &quot;Earth Trisolaran Organization&quot;; for Luo Ji, Shi Qiang was a close friend and always protected him. Luo Ji, and pushed him from being bohemian to taking the responsibility of defending mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At the beginning, we saw the image of Shi Qiang, which looked very much like a real evil policeman who abused his police power and oppressed the people. The book does list his bad deeds: ignoring the safety of the hostages when handling hostage-taking incidents, inciting gangsters to take advantage of others, and extorting confessions through torture... Such a &quot;evil policeman&quot; saved an important scientist, and thus saved the fate of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s implication here is that morality is not important, but talent is the first; it doesn&#39;t matter if you abuse your power or violate laws and disciplines, the most important thing is to be &quot;useful&quot;. Moreover, although such people are cruel to strangers and enemies, they can still treat friends with sincerity. Furthermore, Liu&#39;s Chunqiu style of writing implies that it is precisely evil people like Shi Qiang who have cunning, courage, and talent that ordinary people do not have, but people who are polite and law-abiding cannot do so. It is easy to draw an inference from this: people should tolerate evil people and evil policemen and tolerate their illegal behavior, because only people who have experienced ugliness and are full of gangsters have the ability to protect us. Perhaps, this is what Liu Cixin wants to convey to us. This is not an isolated case in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. There are also some characters later, such as Thomas Wade, who can prove Liu&#39;s subtle hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Throughout the book, there are many positive descriptions of Shi Qiang, such as the aforementioned friendship with Wang Miao and Luo Ji, which is very touching. Liu Cixin tried to strengthen Shi Qiang&#39;s gangster color and chivalrous heart, so that people can form an impression that this kind of person who looks bad (actually has an obviously bad side) is essentially good, and people should understand, Tolerate, appreciate, and praise them. This is a bit like the description of those heroes in &quot;Water Margin&quot; who are both chivalrous and murderous. However, the &quot;heroes&quot; in Water Margin are those who are anti-system and anti-power. Liu Cixin&#39;s Shi Qiang and Thomas Wade are both members of the ruling class who wear official clothes and maintain order. They are also part of the violent machine. &quot;Water Margin&quot; celebrates the spirit of resistance, while &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; praises the &quot;spirit of oppression.&quot; Regardless of Liu Cixin&#39;s subjective intentions, objectively it is a fact that he cleared the ground for members of the state&#39;s powerful departments. Most literary writers will denounce the barbarity of violent machines and the filth of the ruling class in their words (including the gangster novel &quot;Once Upon a Time in the Northeast&quot;, which is not high in style, first talks about the corruption of the cadre class and even the regime&#39;s suppression of democratic protests, and then Talking about gang violence in civil society), only people like Liu Cixin can change the law and sing praises for the system and its attachments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Another description of Shi Qiang not only once again enriches the image of Shi Qiang as a &quot;rogue police hero&quot;, but also reveals Liu Cixin&#39;s stigma and resentment towards the relatively marginalized and unfortunate family victims in society. There is a scene in the book when Shi Qiang and the military police raided an ETO meeting and encountered a young girl threatening a bomb:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Stop.&quot; The nuclear bomb girl warned Da Shi with a wink, her right thumb pressed tightly on the detonation switch, and her nail polish shone in the flashlight light.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Take it easy, girl, there&#39;s something you definitely want to know.&quot; Da Shi stood seven or eight meters away from the girl and took out an envelope from his pocket, &quot;Your mother has been found.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The girl&#39;s bright eyes immediately dimmed, but at this time, these eyes really led to her soul.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Da Shi took the opportunity and took two more steps forward, shortening the distance between himself and the girl to about five meters. The girl alertly raised a nuclear bomb and stopped him with her eyes, but her attention had been greatly distracted. One of the two people who just threw away the fake nuclear bomb walked towards Da Shi and reached for the envelope he was holding. Da Shi pulled out his pistol like lightning. His action of drawing the gun was just blocked by the person who took the letter. The girl did not see it. She only saw a light flash in the ear of the recipient of the letter, and the nuclear bomb in her arms was hit and exploded.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;钬︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Who is that girl?&quot; Wang Miao asked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Da Shi grinned, &quot;How the hell do I know? I&#39;m just guessing. A girl like this has probably never seen her mother. I&#39;ve been in this business for more than 20 years, and I&#39;ve learned how to read people.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In Liu Cixin&#39;s writings, people who attempt to undermine the current order and use extreme means to fight against mainstream society are often victims of society and marginalized groups (of course, this is objectively true). Moreover, from the evaluation and tone of the girl spoken by Shi Qiang above, it can be seen that Liu Cixin does not sympathize with her but despise and dislike her. This tone is like that used in conservative societies towards women who have been sexually assaulted. Instead of expressing deep sympathy, they think the victim is &quot;dirty&quot;. In the eyes of Liu Cixin and others, these extremes, troublemakers, and those who resist order are poor and hateful bugs who have been abandoned by their families and are &quot;motherless.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And this is very consistent with the values 钬嬧€嬧€嬧€媢 nder the current wave of Darwinism in Chinese society. Whenever an extreme incident occurs in society, the Internet is full of voices saying &quot;I don&#39;t want to know what he went through, I just want him to die.&quot; It seems that the guilty person is not Cai Jinggaoqiu, but Yang Zhilinchong (strictly speaking, of course) Yang Zhilinchong is indeed guilty). As for those poor people who protested peacefully and petitioned through formal channels, people looked on with indifference and even took schadenfreude. It’s not that they don’t know the suffering of these victims, but they despise and reject them from above. Not only do they not feel that they have to bear some responsibility and participate in some necessary changes in society, they also feel that these disadvantaged people are an eyesore and influence on them. own mood. The popularity of Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is due to the resonance between the lines and the socialist and self-interested mentality of the middle and upper classes. (Of course, I don’t agree with hurting innocent people, and I believe that once you do something like this, you need to take responsibility regardless of the reason and cannot escape guilt. However, it is necessary to discuss the reasons and solve the problem, even if it eases the conflict, rather than just relying on Violent coercion, killing and rebound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Characters like Shi Qiang in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, there are also many gods-like images in European, American, Japanese and Korean literature and film and television works, that is, a person who seems to be not decent (or indeed not decent) but is in important matters and life and death. Guan Guan showed extraordinary courage and sense of responsibility to reflect the complexity and brilliance of human nature. However, after careful analysis and experience, you will find that the images and purposes of shaping Shi Qiang, Thomas Wade, Luo Ji, etc. in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; are actually different from most European, American, Japanese and Korean works. The latter (such as the seemingly similar characters depicted in the novels of Chekhov, Maupassant, Hugo, and Balzac) is to reflect the complexity of human nature and the glory of justice, while the former is more like whitewashing the powerful and the evil. Giving money to the oppressors and vested interests. This can be reasonably analyzed and speculated through the emotional tendencies between the lines, detailed descriptions, the overall environment, and even the author&#39;s creative background and possible purposes. Of course, the readers&#39; own values 钬嬧€媋 nd experiences will also cause different feelings. At least some people who have read Chinese and foreign literature, film and television works will have this resonance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For example, Hugo&#39;s most famous work &quot;Les Mis 茅 rables&quot; depicts the character of Jean Valjean as a &quot;criminal&quot;. But Hugo did not describe Jean Valjean as disgusting as the &quot;Bomb Girl&quot;. On the contrary, he portrayed Jean Valjean as quite sympathetic. Sheriff Javert, who enforces the law and arrests Jean Valjean, is not as &quot;cool&quot; and admirable as Shi Qiang because of his badness. Instead, he is portrayed by Hugo in a way that makes readers feel hated. In the end, Sheriff Javert also awakened his conscience and completed the redemption together with Jean Valjean. In &quot;Les Mis 茅 rables&quot;, everyone has a clear conscience, and it is precisely because they all maintain a bottom line, and even deliberately &quot;let go of water (such as Javert letting go of Jean Valjean)&quot; when they can achieve their goals, that &quot;Les Mis 茅 rables&quot; ends with End in the light (rather than turning France and the world into a &quot;dark forest&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Maupassant&#39;s &quot;Ball of Suif&quot;, Chekhov&#39;s &quot;Wanka&quot;, and Lu Xun&#39;s &quot;Blessing&quot; all take the portrayal of a vulnerable victim as the theme of the novel, expressing deep sympathy for the person involved in every word, and describing her/ Their experiences were due to the harsh environment, especially the ruthlessness of others, which exposed the ugliness and common hypocrisy of society. More works by these three writers also have such emotional tendencies and moral stances. This is completely opposite to Liu Cixin&#39;s attitude of despising and even ridiculing the weak, praising the wicked, and praising order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is not only true for these famous works, but even some not-so-great literary and artistic works will retain a lot of basic &quot;human flavor&quot;. For example, the criminal investigation drama &quot;Serious Case Group 6&quot;, which was once popular in China, has police officers with different personalities, but they all retain a minimum of human conscience. Perhaps the image of Shi Qiang in The Three-Body Problem is more in line with the true appearance of some police officers, but it obviously should not be portrayed in a praising and encouraging manner. The police in &quot;Serious Case Group Six&quot; may be idealized, but such propaganda can also form a beneficial guidance for the police team, rather than an evil hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(2) Cultural Revolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The mention of the Cultural Revolution in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; has been regarded by some book critics as a breakthrough in contemporary literary works and has also become a major selling point of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. Some people who don&#39;t know much about the details think Liu Cixin is a great writer who dares to touch sensitive issues and reflect on history. It is speculated that the first part of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; won the Hugo Award that year, which may be related to the fact that the book dared to mention this political taboo in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Indeed, the scale of the crazy years and fighting scenes mentioned in the article is shocking. Among the best-selling literary works published in China, there are few that directly present the tragic Cultural Revolution scenes like &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. The book also describes the destruction of knowledge, the persecution of scholars, and the human tragedy of families being separated and friends betrayed under political struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, all these are just phenomena and phenomena. What&#39;s the essence? The reason? Who caused such a tragedy? Neither in the book nor in reality did Liu Cixin make any unfavorable judgments about the regime and the ruling group that led to the Cultural Revolution. While describing various phenomena during the Cultural Revolution, it completely avoids reflection and criticism on related systems, characters, and culture. There is only a statement phenomenon. This statement style and tone seem to tell people that this is a tragedy destined to happen in history, and there is no one responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If Liu Cixin&#39;s calm description of the Cultural Revolution does not fully explain his political attitude, then his attitude towards the &quot;initiators&quot; of the Cultural Revolution is enough to reflect the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In some documents about the &quot;Red Bank Base&quot; we can find a comment that clearly implies that it was written by Mao. The excerpt is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;[Instructions] have been read. This nonsense! Just post the big-character posters on the ground. Do not send them to the sky. The Cultural Revolution leading group should not intervene in Hong&#39;an in the future. Such important letters should be carefully drafted. It is best to set up a special group and organize them in It was discussed and approved at the Politburo meeting.」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And this paragraph: &quot;&lt;strong&gt;In this era, if you want to bring down a high-ranking person, you have to obtain his black materials in various fields in charge of him. However, the two-bomb project is a tricky area for conspirators. This project is under the key protection of the central government. In order to avoid the storm of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, it was difficult for them to intervene. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It&#39;s the shameful logic of &quot;it&#39;s all the people below who do bad things, the emperor is enlightened&quot; again. After the reform and opening up, the worship model that portrayed Mao Zedong as a &quot;great and righteous&quot; saint in the &quot;first thirty years&quot; ended (although it has emerged again in recent years), and was replaced by the arrangement of some anecdotes and personalized remarks of Mao. Create an approachable, far-sighted, sharp-edged image, and cleverly avoid his huge sins, so as to attract the love and even worship of those who do not know the full picture. It has to be said that this way of describing is very confusing and can capture the hearts of contemporary young people far better than the images of &quot;great righteousness&quot; and &quot;gao daquan&quot;. As for the &quot;key protection&quot; described for some scientists, it is also a common method of cleaning up the ground, picking up rice grains in the cesspool, praising the &quot;emperor&#39;s majestic grace&quot;, and shifting all the blame to &quot;conspirators&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What&#39;s more, in fact, those who developed the two bombs were not spared during the Cultural Revolution. They were also brutally persecuted. Some scientists such as Yao Tongbin were beaten to death, Zhao Jiuzhang was forced to commit suicide, and the &quot;two bombs pioneer&quot; Deng Jiaxian and many other scientific researchers who participated in the work It has also been criticized, and the description in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is a blatant falsification of history. Similarly, based on relevant historical facts, it is impossible for Mao to give such &quot;enlightened&quot; instructions on the field of two bombs (Zhou Enlai had relevant protection, even if it was not at the beginning but after the scientists were killed and committed suicide), This so-called &quot;instruction&quot; is also a fabrication (Mao did give instructions with a similar tone on other matters, but it cannot cover up his heinous crimes, and it does not mean that he did the same with the two bombs, and historical facts clearly prove it. He didn&#39;t do that). Literary works can of course contain reasonable fictions, but when it comes to specific real historical events, they must be consistent with basic facts, otherwise it is tampering and fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin used these techniques in the book to not only write off Mao&#39;s heinous crimes, but also gave Mao an enlightened, pragmatic, and de-ideological image. In this way, although Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; mentioned the cruelty of the Cultural Revolution, it not only failed to lead to reflection on Mao&#39;s totalitarian tyranny, but instead glorified the devil and gilded the dark era. This is also consistent with the fact that many young people today who do not know the truth worship Mao, so even though &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; mentions the Cultural Revolution, it is still well received by young people with many Mao fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s depiction of the Cultural Revolution in this way is to some extent more detestable and has a worse impact than those authors who avoid talking about the Cultural Revolution in their works. Borrowing Mao&#39;s phrase &quot;flying a red flag to fight against the red flag&quot;, Liu Cixin&#39;s portrayal of that period of history is very similar to &quot;anti-red flag on the surface but actually flying a red flag&quot; or &quot;a small scolding but a big help&quot;. It seems to be talking about the tragedy of the Cultural Revolution, but in fact it is Excusing those responsible, using superb writing methods without avoiding sensitivity but drawing the opposite conclusion, making people feel that Mao and others were really enlightened and innocent even though they knew the cruelty of the Cultural Revolution. Obviously, this is the reason why the book was published in mainland China without a lot of deletions of plots involving the Cultural Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There are also passages in the book where you can see Liu Cixin&#39;s positive attitude towards Mao from between the lines. For example, when the United Nations wanted Luo Ji to move to a residence that was more suitable for an important figure like Wallfacer, Luo Ji said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Do you know Xibaipo? It&#39;s not far from here. It&#39;s a smaller village. More than two centuries ago, the founder of this country once directed the country&#39;s wars there. The scale of those battles is rare in the world.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;From the tone of this paragraph and the context, you can smell the disgusting smell of powdered hair. The thoughts, policies and actions of this &quot;national founder&quot; killed tens of millions of people (including millions of people in Liu Cixin&#39;s hometown of Henan), and most of the victims were Luoshan County, where Liu was born, and Xinyang, where the county belongs. city 钬嬧€(then called Xinyang District)), destroying tens of thousands or even countless cultural relics and historical sites, and plunged China into a decades-long authoritarian and cruel regime. The common people have lost their rights and the disadvantaged groups are suffering unspeakably. , this legacy still exists today. Created by Mao ZedongstolenThe name of &quot;China&quot; and the people do not understand it eitherA country with power and rights, let alone a &quot;republic&quot;, allows more than one billion or even billions of citizens to live in the world&#39;s largest prison built with tangible borders and invisible walls.But Liu Cixin doesn&#39;t care about this, and neither does today&#39;s vested interest class. They enjoy superior material and non-material supplies, and then put their extravagance and extravagance in the cloak of patriotism and grand historical narrative, and are proud of being a big devil and a national sinner. This is not only a symptom of social Darwinism, but also a typical manifestation of the slave mentality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, some people will excuse this by saying that &quot;China today is a dictatorship, and Liu Cixin has no choice.&quot; But at least he can use neutral terms to describe Mao Zedong and related content, rather than depicting it in a eulogizing way. This was entirely possible, but he didn&#39;t do it. Therefore, Liu Cixin&#39;s praise is very worthy of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(It is worth mentioning that there is also a paragraph in this part. After Mao denied the far-left remarks, he asked someone to write a message to launch to aliens. The content is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Best wishes to the world that receives this message.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Through the following information, you will have a basic understanding of earth civilization. After a long period of labor and creation, mankind has established a splendid civilization, emerged with rich and colorful culture, and initially understood the laws of the operation and development of nature and human society. We cherish all of this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, our world still has great flaws. Hatred, prejudice and war exist. Due to the contradiction between productivity and production relations, the distribution of wealth is seriously uneven, and a considerable number of human beings live in poverty and misery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Human society is working hard to solve various difficulties and problems it faces and to create a better future for earth civilization. The undertaking of the country sending the message is part of this effort. We are committed to building an ideal society in which the labor and value of every human member are fully respected, where the material and spiritual needs of all people are fully met, and where the civilization on earth becomes a more perfect civilization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With good wishes, we look forward to establishing connections with other civilized societies in the universe, and looking forward to working with you to create a better life in the vast universe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Such a passage whitewashes the Cultural Revolution and glorifies Mao. In fact, under the political fervor during the Cultural Revolution, it was more likely that the original far-left fanatics wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To the world that has received the above message, please note that the message you received was sent by a country on earth that represents revolutionary justice! Before this, you may have received information from the same direction, which was sent by an imperialist superpower on the earth. This country competes with another superpower on the earth for world hegemony in an attempt to pull human history backwards. I hope you will not listen to their lies and stand on the side of justice and revolution!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is exactly in line with the political rhetoric and diplomatic rhetoric during the Cultural Revolution. Liu Cixin deliberately wrote these two paragraphs and the comparative display to say that &quot;Mao and his regime were not bad or crazy, it was just some of the people below who were crazy.&quot; This is an old trick used to defend the Cultural Revolution. However, this old trick has been tried many times, and under Liu&#39;s artistic processing, it can be more fake and real. It is especially confusing for people who are not particularly clear about the historical facts of that period and only have a partial understanding)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(3) Ye Wenjie, Shaolin and the female Red Guards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin himself and his work &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; both have strong misogyny. The villains in the article or those who cause bad things are generally women; while those who save the world are all men (of course there are exceptions, but this is generally the case). We will leave the rest for later, but now we will only talk about Ye Wenjie and the characters related to Ye Wenjie, Shaolin, and the female Red Guards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s portrayal of the character Ye Wenjie is still very penetrating. The book devotes a lot of space to describing the various persecutions Ye Wenjie suffered, such as losing her parents due to the Cultural Revolution, being abused by political review cadres, and being betrayed by journalist Bai Mulin, etc., creating a woman who is bitter and full of hatred and distrust of human beings. image. Liu Cixin must have understood and come into contact with such victims in reality, or studied relevant historical archives and news materials, in order to portray a character like Ye Wenjie in such a profound way. As with the aforementioned portrayal of Bomb Girl, Liu Cixin clearly has a lot of knowledge about the behavior of victims of society in planning revenge against society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, unlike the disdain and disgust with Bomb Girl, Liu Cixin showed a certain degree of sympathy for the character Ye Wenjie. But fundamentally, Liu Cixin still classifies victims of the era like Ye Wenjie as those who undermine the mainstream social order. Although Liu has written more sympathetic words about the character Ye, he still views Ye from the perspective of mainstream society and counterinsurgents. That is to say, he will never praise the resistance of victims and weak people, but instead reminds the world to beware of such people. In Liu&#39;s writing, Ye Wenjie brutally killed her husband Yang Weining and leader Lei Zhicheng, causing the Three-Body Problem to flood the earth. In the final analysis, she was a sinner and a great sinner. It may not be so obvious when you look at &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; alone, but compared with authors such as Chekhov, Maupassant, and Ba Jin who praise the struggle of the humiliated and damaged weak, Liu Cixin&#39;s meanness to the victims and maintenance of order are incomparable. It&#39;s clearly reflected. In the book, Ye Wenjie was poured cold water all over her body and quilt by a political cadre in winter. Liu Cixin also used her pen to pour cold water into the hearts and minds of the weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In Liu Cixin&#39;s writing, Ye Wenjie achieved redemption by teaching Luo Ji about the sociology of the universe, and was subsequently arrested and tried, and received &quot;deserved&quot; punishment. The trauma Ye Wenjie suffered was attributed to Bai Mulin and other individuals, instead of rising to the system and political power or even culture and social structure. Even though the book vaguely mentions the general background of the times and people&#39;s helplessness in the political storm environment, it also adheres to the red line of not criticizing historical reality. Screaming, reflection, and condemnation will never be touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Moreover, throughout the book, it can be reasonably assumed that Liu Cixin used Ye Wenjie to introduce the power of Trisolaris to &quot;transform&quot; the earth, metaphorically referring to China&#39;s social victims as inviting the power of the United States to invade. Or, at least that&#39;s how others might reasonably understand it. This understanding of the relevant plot was mentioned in an article by a Chinese-American reporter in The New Yorker interviewing Liu Cixin. Based on this metaphorical inference, Liu Cixin’s criticism of ETO for bringing Trisolaran into the earth is to criticize some 「road-leading parties」, or to force Chinese liberals to be 「way-leading parties」. It is also Liu and 「Three-Body」 that have gained China’s vested interest groups. A reason to be sought after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Another negative female character portrayed by Liu Cixin is Ye Wenjie’s mother Shaolin. This female character has a negative image. She not only betrays the relationship between husband and wife and fights against her husband (but also lies with open eyes and denies recognized physical theorems as a physics expert). She also schemingly hooks up with a decentralized cadre and gains prosperity and wealth. Together with her new husband, she alienated and abandoned Ye Wenjie. This kind of plot should not be uncommon during the Cultural Revolution, or even when many disasters occurred. What Liu wrote is a representation of the facts. But the problem is that Liu vilifies women&#39;s forced self-preservation, implying women&#39;s ingratitude. Moreover, this article (including Liu Cixin’s other articles) never appears as an image of a man who is always in love with women. On the contrary, there is an image of a man like Luo Ji who seems cynical but is very loyal and loving to his wife and children. Of course, it is not necessary for a work to deliberately maintain a balance on gender issues, but the text is written from the heart, and combined with Liu Cixin&#39;s entire book and the values 钬嬧€嬧€嬧€媏 xpressed in his daily life, there is sufficient reason to believe that it is gender biased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The three female Red Guards portrayed in the article better reflect Liu Cixin&#39;s misogyny complex. The article specifically describes five Red Guards, three women and two men. Three female Red Guards are middle school students, and two male Red Guards are college students. The three female middle school Red Guards were very violent, brutal and completely unreasonable. They would only use slogans to deny Ye Zhetai&#39;s fact-based arguments, and then beat Ye Zhetai until his skin and flesh were bruised, and he eventually died. But the male Red Guards &quot;&lt;strong&gt;(Have) a trace of residual sympathy for the teacher&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, and when three female Red Guards were about to beat Ye Zhetai to death, they shouted &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Directive: Fight with words, not with force&lt;/strong&gt;」 (Well, here’s another piece of Mao’s defense) trying to prevent the tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There were indeed many violent female Red Guards and other &quot;revolutionary&quot; women during the Cultural Revolution. It was a group of female students headed by Song Binbin who beat to death Bian Zhongyun, the principal of the Female High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University. In addition, there are many records of female Red Guards and rebels beating and killing people. For example, Ji Xianlin recalled that the female rebel leader Nie Yuanzi directed the rebels to persecute teachers and students at Peking University. The violence of young people and teenage women, as well as the various atrocities committed by some women who became Red Guards and rebel leaders, were specifically mentioned by Yang Jisheng and other official history scholars, who were surprised by the madness of women, especially teenage women. In Beijing, the capital city where the Cultural Revolution was most intense, and on certain occasions, female Red Guards indeed showed unusual destructive power, and their atrocities were witnessed by all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, this does not mean that women in violent movements such as the Cultural Revolution were generally more brutal and anti-intellectual than men. On the contrary, most of the perpetrators of beatings and murder during the Cultural Revolution were still men. This is also proved by a large number of facts, especially those involving various perverted abuses, which were mostly committed by men. For example, most of the violent cases or incidents mentioned in Feng Jicai&#39;s &quot;Ten Years of One Hundred Men&quot; were committed or led by men. The reason why the violence of the female Red Guards is so eye-catching is largely because their violent behavior is in huge contrast with society&#39;s traditional positioning of women and their behavior before the violence. It is even less in line with society&#39;s original expectations than the violent men. Therefore, It becomes more prominent and unique. This exactly reflects the discipline and restraint placed on women by the patriarchal society. Even if women do the same bad behavior as men, they will receive more objections and condemnations. Of course, women’s violence does have its unique characteristics and at certain moments, certain actions are more radical and fanatical than men’s. However, if this creates the impression that 「women are more violent, fanatical, and easily incited」, then it is a sign of patriarchy. The constructed consciousness is nested in the nest. In other words, even if this is a reality that exists sometimes and should not be stripped of its background, it should not be evaluated from a traditional biased perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(4) Three-body game netizens gathering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In this gathering, in addition to Wang Miao and Pan Han, Liu Cixin portrayed six characters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;The old man with gray hair and childlike face is a famous scholar, famous for giving modern scientific connotation to Eastern philosophy. The lady dressed in weird clothes is a famous writer, a rare novelist with avant-garde style but many readers. She wrote You can start reading the book from any page. The other four are two middle-aged people, one is the vice president of the largest software company in the country (dressed simply and casually, you can’t tell at all), and the other is from the National Power Company Senior leaders; two young people, one is a reporter from a major domestic media and the other is a PhD student in science.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin gave these six characters different value choices. To put it simply, the six people were divided into two groups. One group included a reporter, a female writer, an elderly philosopher, and a doctoral student. They were given the image of hating human reality (or even hating the entire human race) and welcoming the invasion of the Three-Body Problem; while the IT deputy The president and Guodian leaders are given an image of being calm, rational, and defending human civilization. Broken down further, journalists and female writers were portrayed as the most radical, an image of being completely disappointed with humanity and eager to embrace the Trisolaran invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This fully reflects Liu Cixin’s views on various groups in society, and is also a view shared by members of the China Socialist Industrial Party. In the eyes of Liu and others, journalists, writers, women, literary and historical philosophers, and young students are all irrational, fond of empty talk, easily emotional, fanatical converts, easily deceived, overly idealistic, and unscrupulous. Reliable, easy to betray... On the contrary, middle-aged men from Kochi Institute of Technology, those working in the science and engineering department, or national civil servants are mature, rational, pragmatic, firm, conservative in ethics and morals, reliable, and committed to career and career. Loyal to the country and mankind...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Through this short chapter, Liu Cixin portrays several groups of people into what he and his peers think they look like. These Socialist Industrialists have always valued theory over literature, despised social justice and humanitarianism, believed in the supremacy of strength, opposed criticism of the system, power, and the strong. They are good at selectively using cold logic, emphasizing spontaneous order and opposing equality and revision. He talks a lot about law and order, but he often takes advantage of legal loopholes and skillfully uses hidden rules to enjoy various privileges and superior conditions as a vested interest. They also like to play with their half-baked knowledge of literature and history, using a mechanical but cunning attitude to understand and explain humanities and social phenomena. What’s even more frightening is that some of these people have also joined key national departments, managing national affairs that should only be handled by people with backgrounds in the humanities and social sciences departments, in a state of 「a layman leading an expert」. Such people are the most powerful force among China&#39;s vested interests and are very powerful in China today. Liu Cixin praises such people and despises their opposite, the humanistic and human rights camp, and of course he gets cheers and applause from his people. (Of course, this does not mean that all people in science and engineering are Socialist Industrialists, only some or even a small part. But this small part is quite harmful)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(5) Evans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The image of Ivens is what Liu Cixin and others recognize as the &quot;white left&quot;. However, Liu Cixin deliberately set up this &quot;white left&quot; to be an extreme environmentalist and animal rights activist, and several &quot;adventists&quot; who joined the Trisolaran organization were also set up to have a similar image, implying that this is common to all &quot;white left&quot; Characteristics and tendencies. By generalizing the extremes, Liu achieved his sinister intention of stigmatizing the &quot;white left&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin first described a Bethune-like figure who was passionate about environmental protection and animal protection, and was unselfish and dedicated to benefiting other animals. But this is just a desire to suppress. As Liu portrays Evans&#39;s despair over mankind&#39;s destruction of the environment and his desire to destroy mankind, the great good man and the great evil man are equated, and &quot;White Zuo&quot; is equated with the devil. In the view of Liu Cixin and social activists, these &quot;white leftists&quot; who live a comfortable life and are enthusiastic about the environment and animal protection have abandoned the principle of putting human beings first and &quot;human&quot; rights first, and will eventually destroy mankind. Liu Cixin also hinted that people should be wary of such &quot;white leftists&quot; in power to prevent them from bringing devastating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; .&lt;/p&gt;

100% 吻合刘慈欣的本意，也没有人有这样的本事，除非有人可以探测出刘慈欣的大脑在想什么。还有很多评断是基于刘慈欣和他的《三体》的客观影响、读者反响。一个作品表达的是什么意义，很大程度在于有自由表达权的读者中的主流所认为的意义（尤其在作者有能力否认却没有否认、否认但是不符合逻辑的情况下）。作者和读者、作品和反响是互动的关系，而非单向的灌输意义。作者在写作时也应该考虑到它究竟会有什么影响，包括自认为的被「误读」。所以，我会通过它在读者中的认知和影响，反推刘慈欣在《三体》中内容情感为何，这并不是故意冤枉他。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;还有，本文作为评论性的文章，当然以批判为主，即便我对刘慈欣的一部分观点赞同，也不会大篇幅的提及。对于刘慈欣塑造的一些争议不大的人物形象（或者说至少我觉得没什么特别需要批判的），如章北海、罗辑等人，以及一些没有特别喻示意义的事件、情节，也就不会费多少笔墨。我写的内容绝大多数都是有异议的那部分。而从整体上，如前所述我赞扬其「能」批判其「德」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（一）史强&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;《三体》中第一个出场的人物是科学家汪淼，但第一个细致刻画的人物则是前来约谈汪淼的警察史强。寥寥几页，就刻画了一个粗鲁野蛮、具入侵性的人物形象。熟读《三体》的铁粉当然知道，开篇对史强的描写，以及后面类似的描写，都是在反衬史强精明强干、充满勇气与责任心做铺垫。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;或者更准确的说，刘慈欣故意将奸狡顽劣与能干及有责任心联系起来，暗示有流氓习气的人物往往是「外冷内热」，本质是好人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我们截取对小说中史强的描述，可以看看刘慈欣想表达、试图灌输一种怎样的价值观。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在《三体》开篇，史强与汪淼见面时：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（汪淼说）「‘科学边界’是一个在国际学术界很有影响的学术组织，成员都是著名学者。这样一个合法的学术组织，我怎么就不能接触了呢？」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「你看看你这个人！」史强大声说，「我们说它不合法了吗？我们说不让你接触了吗？」他 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;说着，刚才吸进肚子里的烟都喷到汪淼脸上。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「我有权不回答，你们请便吧。」汪淼说着要转身回屋。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「等等！」史强厉声说，同时朝旁边的年轻警官挥了一下手，「给他地址和电话，下午去走一趟。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而正是这样一个人，在稍后汪淼被三体人制造的幻象打击的几乎要自杀时，用巧妙的方式让汪淼鼓起了生的勇气，并振作起来参与破获了地球三体组织（ETO）的阴谋。再往后，史强还出奇策（即「古筝行动」）伏杀了伊文思和「审判日」号，以及多次搭救、保护了另一个科学家罗辑，可谓居功甚伟。此外，刘慈欣还描写了史强与汪淼、罗辑的深厚友情。正是在史强的鼓励下，汪淼才重新鼓起生的勇气，并且帮助政府和军警破获了「地球三体组织」的一系列罪案；对罗辑而言，史强更是挚友，一直保护罗辑，并且促使他由放荡不羁到负起保衞人类的责任。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我们一开始看到史强的形象，很像现实中滥用警权、欺压百姓的恶警。书中也的确列举了他的劣迹：处理劫持人质事件时不顾人质安危、鼓动黑帮黑吃黑、刑讯逼供……这样的「恶警」却挽救了一个重要的科学家，进而挽救了人类的命运。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣在这里的暗示就是，德行不是重要的，才能才是第一的；滥用职权、违法乱纪没关系，最重要是「有用」。而且，这样的人虽然对陌生人、敌人残酷，但对待朋友还是可以肝胆相照的。更进一步，刘的春秋笔法在暗示，恰恰是史强这种恶人，才有常人所没有的狡黠、胆识、才华，彬彬有礼、遵纪守法的人反而做不到。这就很容易得出一个推论：人们要容忍恶人、恶警，容忍他们的不法行径，因为只有这样历经丑恶、一身匪气的人，才有保护我们的能力。或许，这正是刘慈欣想传达给我们的。这在《三体》中并非孤例，后面还有一些人物如托马斯维德，可以证明刘这种隐隐的暗示。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在全书中，还有许多对史强的正面描写，如前面提到的讲他和汪淼、罗辑的友情，可谓很感人。刘慈欣试图将史强的流氓色彩与侠义之心都强化起来，让人们形成一种印象，即这种看起来很坏（实际也有明显坏的一面）的人本质上是好的，人们应该理解、容忍、欣赏、赞誉他们。这有点像《水浒传》对那些既行侠仗义又杀人越货的好汉们的描写。不过水浒里那些「好汉」是反体制、反强权的人，刘慈欣笔下的史强和托马斯维德则都是穿着官衣、维护秩序的统治阶层，还都是暴力机器的组成部分。《水浒传》歌颂的是反抗精神，《三体》则是赞扬「压迫精神」。且无论刘慈欣主观意图如何，客观上为国家强力部门人员洗了地是事实。大多数文学作家都会在字里行间谴责暴力机器的野蛮、统治阶层的肮脏（包括格调并不高的黑帮小说《东北往事》，也是先谈了干部阶层的贪腐乃至政权对民主抗议的镇压，再讲民间社会的黑帮暴力），只有刘慈欣这样的会变着法的为体制及体制的附着物唱赞歌。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;另一段对史强的描写，不仅再次充实了史强这个「流氓警察英雄」的形象，还透露了刘慈欣对社会中相对边缘的、不幸的家庭受害者的污名、怨毒心态。书中有一段史强与军警突袭 ETO 会议，遭遇一个年轻女孩持炸弹威胁时的情景：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「站住。」核弹女孩向大史抛了个媚眼警告道，右手拇指紧按在起爆开关上，指甲油在电筒光中闪亮着。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「悠着点儿丫头，有件事儿你肯定想知道。」大史站在距女孩七八米远处，从衣袋中掏出一个信封，「你母亲找到了。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;女孩儿神采飞扬的眼睛立刻黯淡了下来，但这时，这双眼睛真的通向她的心灵。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;大史趁机又向前跨了两步，将自己与女孩的间距缩短至五米左右，女孩警惕地一举核弹，用目光制止了他，但她的注意力已经被大大分散了。刚才扔掉假核弹的两人中的一个向大史走来，伸手来拿他举着的信封，大史闪电般抽出手枪，他抽枪的动作正好被取信的人挡住， &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;女孩没有看到，她只看到取信人的耳边亮光一闪，怀中的核弹就被击中爆炸了。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「那个女孩子是谁？」汪淼问。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;大史咧嘴一笑，「我他妈的怎么知道，瞎猜的，这样的女孩子，多半没见过妈。我干这行二十多年，就学会了看人。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在刘慈欣笔下，妄图破坏现行秩序、采用极端手段对抗主流社会的人，往往都是社会的受害者、边缘人群（当然客观上也的确是这样）。而且，从上面借史强之口说出的对女孩的评价及语气，可看出刘慈欣对其并非抱以同情而是鄙夷、厌弃。这种语调就像保守社会里对被性侵的女性那样，不是深表同情，而是觉得受害者「脏」。在刘慈欣们眼里，这些走极端的、闹事的、反抗秩序的，就是被家庭抛弃的、「没妈」的可怜又可恨的虫子。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而这是很符合如今中国社会达尔文主义浪潮下的价值观的。每当社会上发生极端事件，互联网上都是一片「我不想知道他经历了什么，我只想要他死刑」的声音，仿佛有罪的不是蔡京高俅，而是杨志林冲（当然严格来说杨志林冲的确有罪）。而对于那些采取和平抗议、正规渠道上访的可怜人，人们也个个冷眼旁观甚至幸灾乐祸。他们不是不知道这些受害者遭受苦难，而是高高在上的鄙视、排斥之，不仅不觉得自己要负上某种责任、参与社会某种必要的改变，还觉得这些弱势者碍了自己眼、影响了自己心情。刘慈欣的《三体》大火，正在于字里行间和中上阶层社达化利己主义化的心态形成互鸣。（当然我并不赞同伤及无辜，而且认为一旦做了这种事，无论原因如何都需要承担责任而不能脱罪，但是讨论原因和解决问题哪怕缓和矛盾，都是必要的，而不是只凭借暴力威压、灭杀反弹）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;《三体》中史强这样的人物，欧美日韩文学和影视作品中也有许多形似神也似乎似的形象，即一个看似不正派（或者也的确不正派）的人却在重要事情和生死关头表现出超凡的勇气与责任心，以反映人性的复杂、人性的光辉。但是仔细分析和感受，就会发现其实《三体》中史强、托马斯维德、罗辑等这样的形象及塑造目的，与大多数欧美日韩作品并不相同。后者（例如契诃夫、莫泊桑、雨果、巴尔扎克的小说中刻画的似乎相似的人物）是为了反映人性的复杂、正义的光辉，前者则更像在为强权与恶人洗白，在为压迫者与既得利益阶层贴金。这可以通过字里行间的感情倾向、细节描写、整体环境乃至作者的创作背景及可能的目的等，进行合理的分析和推测，当然读者自身的价值观和经历也会引起不同感受。饱读中外文学与影视作品的，至少有一部分人应该会产生这种共鸣。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;例如雨果最知名的著作《悲惨世界》，刻画了冉阿让这一「罪犯」身份的角色。但雨果并未将冉阿让描写的像「炸弹女孩」这样让人厌弃，相反刻画的颇为令人同情。而执行法律、抓捕冉阿让的沙威警长，并不像史强那样因坏而「酷」、坏的令人佩服，反而被雨果刻画的让读者感到痛恨。最后，沙威警长也良知苏醒，与冉阿让共同完成了救赎。在《悲惨世界》中，每个人都良心未泯，且正是由于都保有底线，乃至在可以达成目的时故意「放水（如沙威放走冉阿让）」，才让「悲惨世界」以走向光明而落幕（而非让法国乃至世界变成「黑暗森林）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而莫泊桑的《羊脂球》、契诃夫的《万卡》、鲁迅的《祝福》，都以刻画一个弱势受害者为小说主题，字里行间都表达了对当事人深深的同情，并将她/他们的遭遇归于环境的恶劣尤其他人的无情，鞭挞了社会的丑恶、纲常的虚伪。这三位作家的更多作品，也都是如此的感情倾向和道德立场。这与刘慈欣鄙夷乃至讥嘲弱者、称颂恶人、赞颂秩序的态度截然相反。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;不仅这些名家名作如此，即便是一些并不那么伟大的文艺作品，也会保留许多基本的「人味」。例如曾经风靡中国的刑侦剧《重案六组》，里边的警察也是个性各异，但也都保留起码的人性良知。或许三体中史强的形象更符合部分警察的真实面目，但显然不应以称颂和鼓励的态度刻画之。《重案六组》中的警察或许理想化了，但这样的文宣也可以对警察队伍形成一种有益的引导，而非邪恶的暗示。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（二）文革&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;《三体》中提及文革，被一些书评人当成当代文学作品一大突破，也成为《三体》一大卖点。一些不怎么了解详情的人，还因此以为刘慈欣是敢于触及敏感问题、反思历史的伟大作家。据人推测，当年《三体》第一部获雨果奖，可能就与书中敢于提及这一中国的政治禁忌有关。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;的确，文中提到的疯狂岁月、武斗场面，尺度之大令人震惊。在中国公开发行的畅销文学作品中，鲜有如《三体》这样直接的呈现惨烈的文革情景。书中也描绘了对知识的摧残、对学者的迫害，以及政治斗争下家庭离散、朋友背叛的人伦惨剧。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;可是，这一切都只是现象、现象。本质呢？原因呢？是谁造成了这样的悲剧？刘慈欣在书中和现实里都不曾对酿成文革的这个政权、这个统治集团做任何的不利评判。在描绘文革中种种现象的同时，完全回避了对相关的制度、人物、文化的反思与批判。只有陈述现象，这种陈述方式和语气似乎在告诉人们，这是一场历史中注定发生的悲剧，没有责任人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;如果刘慈欣对文革的冷静敍述还不能完全说明其政治态度，那么他对文革「始作俑者」的态度，足以反映问题了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在关于「红岸基地」的一些文件中，我们可以找到一段显然暗示是毛所写的批语，摘录如下：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「【批示】已阅，狗屁不通！大字报在地上贴就行了，不要发到天上去，文革领导组今后不要介入红岸。这样重要的信件应慎重起草，最好成立一个专门小组，并在政治局会议上讨论通过。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;还有这一段：「&lt;strong&gt;这个年代，要搞倒一个位置很高的人，就要在其分管的各个领域得到他的黑材料，但两弹工程对阴谋家们来说是个棘手的领域，这个工程处于中央的重点保护之下，得以避开「文革」的风雨，他们很难插手进去。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;又是那套「都是底下人办坏事，皇上是开明的」的可耻洗地逻辑。改革开放后，「前三十年」将毛泽东塑造为「伟光正」圣人的崇拜模式结束了（虽然近些年又在冒起），取而代之的是将毛一些逸闻、个性化的言论加以编排，塑造一种平易近人、高瞻远瞩、棱角分明的形象，并巧妙回避他的巨大罪恶，以吸引不明全貌者对其的喜爱甚至崇拜。不得不说，这种描写方式很有迷惑性，远比「伟光正」、「高大全」的形象能俘获当代青年的人心。至于描述的对部分科学家「重点保护」，同样是洗地的惯常手段，在屎坑里捡米粒，歌颂「皇恩浩荡」，把责任都推给「阴谋家」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;何况，实际上研发两弹人员在文革中也并未幸免，同样受到了残酷迫害，一些科学家如姚桐斌被打死、赵九章被迫自杀身亡，「两弹元勋」邓稼先及其他许多参与工作的科研人员也遭批斗，《三体》中的描述是公然的篡改历史。同样，根据相关史实，毛也不可能对两弹领域做出那样「开明」的批示（周恩来有过相关保护，哪怕也不是一开始就保护而是发生了科学家被打死、自杀事件后），这段所谓「批示」也形同捏造（毛确实在其他事情上做过类似语气的批示，但一不能掩盖其滔天罪恶，二不能说明他在两弹事情上也这么做了，而且史实明确证明他没这么做）。文学作品当然可以有合理虚构，但是在涉及到具体的真实历史事件时，必须与基本事实相符合，否则就是在篡改和捏造。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣在书中正是使用了这些手法，不仅将毛的滔天罪恶勾销，还赋予毛一种开明、务实、去意识形态化的形象。这样，刘慈欣的《三体》虽提到了文革的残酷，却不仅没引导反思毛的极权暴政，反为魔头增色、为黑暗年代贴金。这同样与当今许多不明真相的青年崇毛合拍，使得《三体》即便提及文革，仍然获毛粉众多的青年人好评。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣这样描绘文革，某种程度比那些在作品中回避不谈文革的作者更可恶、影响更坏。借用毛一句话「打着红旗反红旗」，刘慈欣对那段历史的刻画很像「表面反红旗实际反而在打红旗」或者说「小骂大帮忙」，看似讲文革惨剧，实际上却在为相关责任人开脱，用高超的写作方式不回避敏感却得出相反结论，让人在知晓文革残酷的情况下，还觉得毛等人真是开明和无辜的。显然，这也正是该书对涉及文革的情节没有大量删改就得以在中国大陆出版发行的原因。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;书中还有段落可以从字里行间看到刘慈欣对毛的肯定态度，如联合国希望罗辑搬到一个更符合面壁者这样重要人物身份的居所时，罗辑说的话：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「知道西柏坡吗？离这儿不远，那是一个更小的村庄，两个多世纪前，这个国家的创始人曾在那里指挥过全国的战争，那些战役的规模世界罕见。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;从本段语气及结合上下文，又可以嗅出那股令人作呕的毛粉味。这个「国家创始人」的思想、政策和行为杀害和致死了数千万人（包括刘慈欣老家河南几百万人，且大多数死难者正是刘的籍贯地罗山县及该县所属的信阳市（当时叫信阳专区）的居民），破坏了成千上万乃至难以计数的文物和历史遗迹，也让中国陷入长达数十年的专制酷政，平民百姓权利丧失，弱势群体苦不堪言，这遗毒迄今犹存。毛泽东创建的这个窃取了「中华」之名、人民也不掌握权力和拥有权利、更无「共和」之实的国家，让十多亿乃至累计数十亿国民生活在有形边界和无形高墙构筑的世界最大监牢中。但刘慈欣不在乎这些，当今的既得利益阶层也不在乎这些，他们享受着优越的物质和非物质供给，再为骄奢淫逸披上爱国主义、宏大历史敍事的外衣，为大魔头兼民族罪人而自豪。这不仅是社会达尔文主义的一种症状，更是奴才心理的典型表现。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;当然，有人会以「当今中国是专制政治，刘慈欣是不得已」为之开脱。但是起码他可以使用中性词汇描述毛泽东及相关内容，而不是以赞颂方式描绘。这完全是可以做得到的，可以他没有这样做。所以，刘慈欣的这种赞颂是非常值得被批判的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（值得提及的是，这部分还有一段内容，是在讲毛否定那段极左言论后，又让人撰写了一段向外星发射的信息，内容如下：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;向收到该信息的世界致以美好的祝愿。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;通过以下信息，你们将对地球文明有一个基本的了解。人类经过漫长的劳动和创造，建立了灿烂的文明，涌现出丰富多彩的文化，并初步了解了自然界和人类社会运行发展的规律，我们珍视这一切。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但我们的世界仍有很大缺陷，存在着仇恨、偏见和战争，由于生产力和生产关系的矛盾，财富的分布严重不均，相当部分的人类成员生活在贫困和苦难之中。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;人类社会正在努力解决自己面临的各种困难和问题，努力为地球文明创造一个美好的未来。发送该信息的国家所从事的事业就是这种努力的一部分。我们致力于建立一个理想的社会，使每个人类成员的劳动和价值都得到充分的尊重，使所有人的物质和精神需要都得到充分的满足，使地球文明成为一个更加完美的文明。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我们怀着美好的愿望，期待着与宇宙中其他文明社会建立联系，期待着与你们一起，在广阔的宇宙中创造更加美好的生活。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;这样一段话又是粉饰文革、为毛贴金的。事实上，文革中那种政治狂热下，更可能的是原来的极左狂热分子编写的那样：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;收到以上信息的世界请注意，你们收到的信息，是地球上代表革命正义的国家发出的！这之前，你们可能已经收到了来自同样方向的信息，那是地球上的一个帝国主义超级大国发出的，这个国家与地球上的另一个超级大国争夺世界霸权，企图把人类历史拉向倒退。希望你们不要听信他们的谎言，站在正义的一方，站在革命的一方！&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;这恰恰最符合文革时期的政治辞令、外交辞令。刘慈欣故意编写这两段内容及对比展示，意在讲「毛和政权并不坏不疯狂，疯狂的只是下面一些人」这套为文革辩护的旧伎俩。但是这种旧伎俩的确屡试不爽，且在刘的艺术加工下更能以假乱真，对于对那段历史史实并不特别清楚、只是一知半解的人，特别有迷惑性）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（三）叶文洁、绍琳和女红衞兵&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣本人及其作品《三体》都有很强的厌女情结。文中的反派人物或搞坏事情的，普遍都是女性；而拯救世界的，则都是男性（当然也有例外，但是大体如此）。其他人放在以后再说，现在只谈叶文洁及与叶文洁有关的人物绍琳、女红衞兵。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣对叶文洁这个人物，刻画的还是很入骨的。书中用了很大篇幅讲述叶文洁遭遇的种种迫害，如因文革丧父失母、被政审干部虐待、被记者白沐霖背叛等，塑造了一个苦大仇深、对人类充满怨恨与不信任的女性形象。刘慈欣一定是在现实中了解、接触过这种受害者，或者研究过相关历史档案、新闻资料，才能将叶文洁这样的人物形象刻画的入木三分。如前面提到的对炸弹女孩的刻画那样，刘慈欣显然对社会的受害者筹划报复社会的行为颇有研究。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;不过，不像对炸弹女孩那样的鄙夷与厌弃，刘慈欣对叶文洁这个人物施以了一定的同情。但根本上，刘慈欣还是将叶文洁这样的时代受害者归为毁损主流社会秩序的人。刘虽然对叶这个人物多了同情的笔墨，但仍是站在主流社会、平叛者的角度来看待叶的，也就是他绝不会称颂受害者、弱者的反抗，反而在提醒世人提防这样的人。在刘的笔下，叶文洁残忍害死丈夫杨衞宁和领导雷志成，引三体祸水涌向地球，归根结底是个罪人、大罪人。单独看《三体》或许还不是那么明显，但是和契诃夫、莫泊桑、巴金这样作者对被侮辱与被损害的弱者抗争的讴歌比起来，刘慈欣对受害者的刻薄、对秩序的维护就无比明显的体现出来了。书中叶文洁被一个政工干部在冬天泼了一身和一被子冷水，刘慈欣同样在用笔往弱者心肝里注入冷水。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在刘慈欣笔下，叶文洁以给罗辑讲宇宙社会学的方式做了救赎，随后就被拘捕和审判，受到了「应有的」惩罚。对于叶文洁所受的创伤，都归咎给了白沐霖等个体，而不会上升到制度与政权乃至文化与社会结构。即便书中恍恍惚惚提及了时代的大背景、人们在政治风暴大环境下的无奈，也谨守不涉及批判历史现实的红线。呐喊、反思、声讨，是万万不会碰的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而且，纵观全书，可以合理假设，刘慈欣是将叶文洁引三体力量「改造」地球，暗喻为中国的社会受害者引美国的力量入侵。或者，至少其他人对此可以合理的这样理解。在《纽约客》一位华裔美国记者采访刘慈欣的文章中，就提及了对相关情节的这种理解。根据这样的暗喻推论，刘慈欣挞伐 ETO 引三体入地球，也就是在抨击一些「带路党」，或者说把中国自由派强行当成「带路党」，也是刘及《三体》得到中国既得利益群体追捧的一个原因。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣刻画的另一个反面女性人物，是叶文洁的母亲绍琳。这个女性人物的形象负面，不仅背弃夫妻情分批斗自己丈夫（而且还睁眼说瞎话，作为物理学专家否定被公认的物理定理），还很有心机的勾上一个下放干部，得到荣华富贵后又和新丈夫一起疏远离弃叶文洁。这种情节在文革中应该并不鲜见，甚至说在许多灾祸发生时都不鲜见，刘所写的是一种事实的再现。但是问题是刘将女性这种迫不得已的自保丑化，暗示女性的忘恩负义。而且，这文章（也包括刘慈欣任何其他文章）中从没有出现男性对女性始乱终弃的人物形象，相反有罗辑那样看似玩世不恭却对妻儿非常忠贞和爱护的男人形象。当然，一部著作是没必要必须在性别议题上刻意保持平衡，但是文由心生，结合刘慈欣全书及其日常表现的价值观，有充足理由相信其是带有性别偏见的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;文中刻画的那三个女红衞兵，更能体现刘慈欣的厌女情结。文中特意写了三女两男五个红衞兵，三个女红衞兵是中学生，两个男红衞兵是大学生。三个女中学生红衞兵非常狂暴野蛮，完全不讲理，只会用口号否定叶哲泰基于事实的辩驳，然后将叶哲泰打的皮开肉绽，最终死去。而男红衞兵反而「&lt;strong&gt;对老师（有）一丝残存的同情&lt;/strong&gt;」，并且在三个女红衞兵将要打死叶哲泰时喊出「&lt;strong&gt;最高指示：要文斗不要武斗&lt;/strong&gt;」（呃，这里又一处为毛辩解的）试图阻止悲剧。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;文革中的确有不少狂暴的女红衞兵和其他「革命」女性，打死北师大女附中校长卞仲耘的就是以宋彬彬为首的一群女学生。除此之外，也有许多女红衞兵、造反派打人虐人杀人的记录，如季羡林就忆述女性造反派头目聂元梓指挥造反派迫害北大师生。青年和少年女性的狂暴，以及一些跻身红衞兵、造反派领袖的女性各种暴行，为杨继绳等正史学者特地提及，并诧异于女性尤其青少年女性的这种疯狂。在文革最激烈的首都北京及某些场合，女红衞兵的确表现出异乎寻常的破坏力，其暴行也是有目共睹。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，这并不意味着文革等暴力运动中女性比男性普遍更加残暴、反智。相反，文革中大多数打人杀人者仍然是男性，这同样有大量事实证明，尤其涉及各种变态凌虐的，大都是男性做出的。如冯骥才的《一百个人的十年》中提到的大多数暴力案例或事件，都是男性做下或者主导的。而女红衞兵的暴力之所以非常引人注目，很大程度在于其暴虐举动与社会对女性的传统定位及暴虐前的表现形成巨大反差，比施暴的男性更不符合社会原有的期待，所以就显得更为突出和特异。这恰恰反映了男权社会对女性的规训和约束，让女性哪怕做一些和男性一样的糟糕行为，都会得到更多异议和谴责。当然女性的暴力也确有独特之处及某些时刻某些举动比男性更加激进狂热的情况，但是如果以此形成「女性更暴力更狂热更易被煽动」的印象，那就是进了男权主义建构的意识巢窠中了。或者说，即便这是部分时候存在的某种不应该剥离背景的现实，但也不应该以传统的偏见视角去评价。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（四）三体游戏网友聚会&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在这场聚会中，除汪淼和潘寒外，刘慈欣刻画了六个人物形象：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「那位鹤发童颜的老者，是一位著名学者，以给东方哲学赋予现代科学内涵而闻名。那位穿着怪异的女士，是著名作家，是少见的风格前衞却拥有众多读者的小说家，她写的书，从哪一页开始看都行。其他四位，两名中年人，一位是国内最大软件公司的副总裁（穿着朴素随意，丝毫看不出来），另一位是国家电力公司的高层领导；两名年轻人，一位是国内大媒体的记者，另一位是在读的理科博士生。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣赋予了这六个角色不同的价值选择。简单来说，将六人分成了两组，一组包括记者、女作家、老年哲学家、博士生，被赋予了厌恶人类现实（甚至厌恶整个人类）、欢迎三体入侵的形象；而 IT 副总裁和国电领导则被赋予了冷静、理性、捍衞人类文明的形象。再细分，记者和女作家被描绘的最为激进，一幅对人类彻底失望、急切拥抱三体入侵者的形象。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;这充分反映了刘慈欣对社会各群体的看法，也是中国社达工业党人士共同的看法。在刘及这些人眼中，记者、作家、女性、文史哲学者、青年学生，都是不理性的、喜好空谈的、容易感情用事的、皈依者狂热的、易受蛊惑的、过于理想主义的、不可靠的、易背叛的……相反，高知理工中年男性、从事理工部门工作的或国家公务员，则是成熟的、理性的、务实的、坚定的、保守伦常道德的、可靠的、对事业、国家和人类忠诚的……&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣通过这短短的一章，就将几类人群刻画成他及同类们认为的模样。这些社达工业党们向来重理轻文，蔑视社会公正及人道主义，信奉实力至上，反对对制度、强权、强者的批判，擅于选择性利用冷冰冰的逻辑，强调自发秩序反对平权和修正，满嘴 law and order 却自己经常钻法律的空子及纯熟利用潜规则，享受着作为既得利益者拥有的各种特权和优越条件。他们还很喜欢耍弄其民科型半吊子文史知识，用机械却又狡猾的态度去理解和解释人文社会现象。更可怕的是，这些人中的一部分还跻身国家要害部门，以「外行领导内行」的状态，管理着本应是人文社科院系出身者才能负责的国家事务。这样的人是中国既得利益者中最庞大的势力，在当今中国非常得势。刘慈欣吹捧这样的同类，鄙夷他们对立面的人文人道人权派，当然得到同类们的欢呼喝彩。（当然并不是说所有理工科人士都是社达工业党，只是一部分乃至一小部分。但这一小部分就颇具危害）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（五）伊文思&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;伊文思这个形象，就是刘慈欣们所认知的「白左」。只是，刘慈欣有意的将这个「白左」设置成极端环保和动保人士，还有几个加入三体组织的「降临派」也被设置成类似形象，暗示这是所有「白左」共同的特征和倾向。通过将极端者一般化，刘就达到了其污名化「白左」的险恶用心。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣首先描述了一个热衷于环保和动物保护、毫不利己专门利它的白求恩式人物。但这只是欲抑先扬。随着刘刻画出伊文思对人类破坏环境的绝望、生出的毁灭人类之心，大善人和大恶人画上了等号，「白左」和恶魔画上了等号。在刘慈欣和社达分子们看来，这些生活优渥、热心环境和动物保护的「白左」们，背弃了人类第一、「人」权至上的原则，最终一定会毁灭人类。刘慈欣也在暗示人们要警惕这样的「白左」当道，防止他们带来毁灭性的后果。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;这又是能引起刘慈欣的粉丝们疯狂共鸣的。在中国互联网平台，被辱骂最多的就是「白左」。不仅环保和动保分子会被视为「白左」，诸如主张提高社会福利、给富人征税、种族平权、女权和 LGBT 权利、接纳移民、废除死刑……都会被冠以「白左」之名。社达分子视社会平等和博爱主义为寇仇，他们认为这些以「爱」、「平等」为名的政策抹杀了物竞天择适者生存的价值，导致了人和社会的堕落。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣塑造出伊文思这样一个极端环保动保分子形象，就是传达「白左」祸乱人类世界这一思想。当然，他还塑造了程心这一很有爱心但败事有余的更加典型的「白左」，这留在后面来说。诚然，我个人也反对极端的环保和动保分子，对所谓「白左」的部分价值观和行为不能同意，但刘慈欣这样以偏概全、用极端例子暗示普遍性的故意渲染更为恶心。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;书中有一段一位 ETO 成员的话，很值得玩味：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「这不是谣传！」一个欧洲人大声说，同时挤到前面来，「我叫拉菲尔，以色列人。三年前，我十四岁的儿子遇到了车祸，我把孩子的肾捐给了一个患尿毒症的巴勒斯坦女孩，以此表达我对两个民族和平相处的愿望，为了这个愿望，我甚至可以献出自己的生命，而许许多多的以色列人和巴勒斯坦人也在做着和我一样的真诚努力。但这一切都没有用，我们的家园仍在冤冤相报的泥潭中越陷越深。这使我对人类失去了信心，加入了三体组织。绝望使我由一个和平主义者变为极端分子，同时，可能也是由于我对组织巨额的捐助，让我得以进入降临派的核心。现在我告诉你们，降临派有自己的秘密纲领，它就是：人类是一个邪恶的物种，人类文明已经对地球犯下了滔天罪行，必须为此受到惩罚。降临派的最终目标就是请主来执行这个神圣的惩罚：毁灭全人类！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在刘慈欣看来（或者说他想让读者认为的是），那些强烈追求世界和平、美好的人如果达不成这样的目的，就会因绝望悲愤转向厌弃人类、试图毁灭一切，因此这些主张爱与和平的「白左」实质都是潜在的恐怖分子，危害比一般的、谋求私利、道德低下的坏人大多了。而一些「白左」执着、坚定的信念，充满热情的情绪、为改变现实不惜代价的行为，都会被刘慈欣们视为疯狂或走向疯狂的前兆，视为秩序的破坏者或就是彻头彻尾的神经病，应该予以警惕、扑灭、摧毁。而像伊文思、拉菲尔这样有钱有能力更积极将理想付诸实践的「白左」，刘慈欣们认为更应该被警惕和扑灭，因为这些人有更大的现实危险性。书中伊文思和「降临派」在「古筝行动」中集体惨死，就是刘对「白左」怨毒的显露。即便刘慈欣并不认为白左会去毁灭世界，也是认为白左的种种行为和倾向，最终会在客观上导致世界毁灭。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;真实世界的「白左」当然不是这样，或者起码大多数不是这样。虽然左翼分子不乏走到极端的，但是就像为极端理想而诉诸暴力的日本赤军、红色旅、埃塔，以及一些特别极端（尤其使用暴力）的环保动保人士那样，是非常边缘化的，完全不能代表主张变革主义、爱与和平至上的主流左派。至于马列毛那种「左派」或者说理想主义激进主义者，无论价值观还是行为，显然已和刘慈欣所描述的那种「白左」大相径庭，没有比拟的意义。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;当然，主流左派确实会在不断努力后却无法解决人类的丑恶而失望乃至绝望，也会滋生一种「干脆世界毁灭算了」的情绪，但是这种情绪不代表其现实中真的会这么选择。就像人和他人发生矛盾、遇到委屈，某个时间段（或者就是几秒钟一个念头）想弄死对方或者破罐破摔的情绪很正常，但是大多数都会平复下来，而不可能真的去实践。就像鲁迅就经常发表对人性丑恶绝望的言论，也说过「不在沉默中爆发，就在沉默中灭亡」这样的话，但是他真的是要人们毁灭世界吗？并不是，相反他在呼吁人们坚定的追求真善美、公平正义。「白左」普遍非常关注气候变暖问题并阻止恶化，如果因绝望、认为世间肮脏而真想毁灭人类，或者觉得人类毁灭也不足惜，那应该是鼓吹放弃拯救气候变暖，以期待若干年后陆地被淹没、高温把人类都热死才对。而且，随着时代发展社会进步，左翼或者说「白左」是越来越温和的，且经过 20 世纪一些极端的尝试失败后，现在都选择更加折中理性的方式解决问题，不求绝对完美。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（六）黑暗森林&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「黑暗森林法则」是刘慈欣《三体》第二部的主题，也直接表达了他的社达主义理念。所谓「黑暗森林」，就是人（或整个人类文明），处于有限而黑暗的空间之中，人与人（或星球与星球）之间存在着你死我活的竞争关系。为争夺生存空间、消除潜在威胁，这些人（星球）之间都想方设法要除掉或征服对方。他还通过描述星际舰队自相残杀以争夺资源，来将「黑暗森林法则」更加凸出的展示出来。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣的黑暗森林理论，主要显然并不是为了解释星球之间的关系，而是喻指人与人、族群与族群、国家与国家之间的关系。虽然刘慈欣曾在对他的采访中否认了这一点，但其言不由衷。刘慈欣在《三体》中描述的内容和宣扬的价值观，都是在喻指现实世界、人类社会，而不是为科幻而科幻。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣这样的价值观，将不同的人或群体对立起来，将竞争视为零和博弈，认为只有消灭或征服对方自身才能安全，与两三个世纪前至上世纪中期盛行于全球（也曾一度在中国学界被热捧）的社会达尔文主义思想有非常多共同之处。而今日的世界，这一理论虽已不在庙堂之高公开被认可，却在江湖之远四处流行。从俄罗斯到印度，从尼日利亚到印尼，社达思潮都以民族主义、民粹主义等形式存在着。而在中国，则普遍以尊崇强权和体制、歧视和欺凌同胞中的弱者等形式存在着，且更加贴近社会达尔文主义的本来面目：恃强凌弱、适者生存。例如中国精英群体聚集的论坛知乎，就是社达主义大本营，也同样是《三体》及刘慈欣本人的粉丝集中地。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「黑暗森林法则」的根本缺陷是，无视人或人群之间存在的互助合作、传播文明的善意，无视道德、是非与人道主义的因素存在，无视未来有更好的价值观和方式来改善现状的可能性（刘在书中甚至对这种改善持强烈反对的态度，原因下一节就会提到），无视追求人道、平等、互信的必要性，将人际、族际、国际关系完全当成没有人性的冷冰冰赤裸裸的利益关系，以机械主义的理性代替人性的理性与感性，这并不完全符合现实中的人际族际国际关系。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;当然，我并不是要否定人际族际国际关系中存在博弈、对抗甚至零和的一面，并不否认相关关系中存在广泛的尔虞我诈、阴险与暴力（甚至恰恰相反，我很确定这些的存在，以及其历史及现实中对人类社会关系的支配作用）。典型的例如美苏、印巴等国之间及世界各核大国之间的核威慑，即是「黑暗森林威慑」的现实版。在现实生活中，也有从官员到普通职员中，各方拿着对方「黑材料」以互相要挟的情形。人与人之间往往也都存在着基于实力、未知、心术等的博弈、斗争的得失。可以说，「黑暗森林」的许多情形早已在地球的国与国、群体与群体、人与人之间发生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;只是，这并不是全部，只是一部分、一个侧面。更重要的是，恶的东西是现实，但是不代表它是合理的应当的，更不应该提倡这种恶。刘慈欣的《三体》将这一侧面放大为社会关系的全部，并且将之视为存亡的基础和博弈的准则加以肯定，并暗示只有如此之恶、失去人性摒弃温情，才能保住人类文明。这是在毒害人心、破坏善意和信任，让人民不再去探求一种更加合理的解决争端和生存生活方式，将人们真的引向黑暗森林法则思想指导的社会环境之中。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，我们也不能否定这种情况的客观存在，不能放弃使用筹码保留威慑能力的必要性。这的确也就陷入了「黑暗森林」的巢窠，但我们的确无法完全脱离这样的现实。只有用剑与盾护住的花，才能长久开放。只是，我们不要彻底迷失和沉醉在这种「黑暗森林」式的社会关系之中。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（七）大低谷之后到星际舰队毁灭、威慑纪元后期这两个时期&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;这两段岁月被刘慈欣描述的十分美好，物质丰盈、社会和谐，人的权利与自由得到了充分的尊重。比如，全自动化、数字化带来的高度人性化的生活方式；对「面壁计划」产生的人权侵犯、权力滥用、不受监督情况的谴责和终止；生活中发生意外情况均可以得到经济赔偿；银行为冬眠者提供优厚的巨额的存款利息……总之，让人们可以舒适的、有尊严的活着。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，这一切又是欲抑先扬，或者说是为后面的悲剧做铺垫。在刘笔下这时的人们，已经对人类自身的文明变得过度自信，并且因此生发出过多的同情心同理心，丧失了警惕性与危机意识，并最终导致后来星际舰队的覆灭，以及威慑纪元之前那段人类处于绝望中的痛苦。而对威慑纪元后期（至威慑失效时）的描绘也异曲同工。在此摘取几个典型段落予以分析。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在星际舰队接触三体派来的「水滴」之前，有这么一段描写：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「公众对三体世界的感情，开始由敌视和仇恨转向同情、怜悯甚至敬佩。人们同时也意识到这样一个事实：三体世界的十个水滴在两个世纪前就发出了，而人类直到现在才真正理解了它们的含义，这固然因为三体文明的行为过分含蓄，也从另一个方面反映了人类被自己的血腥历史所扭曲的心态。在全球网上的公民投票中，阳光计划的支持率急剧上升，且有越来越多的人倾向于把火星作为三体居留地的强生存方案。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;这段话集中反映了人类在大低谷结束并进行「第二次启蒙运动/文艺复兴/大革命」、「给岁月以文明」后，人类对三体问题及三体世界看法的根本转变。而这种转变的原因，正是自己物质丰富、军事强大、思想文明的产物。人类处境的改变、社会再度高度文明化，让人类由对三体世界恐惧、敌对和保持高度警惕，变成了一种同情怜悯。这时人类的心态，与后面发生的星际舰队被几乎全歼时的绝望，形成了鲜明的对比。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;以这段描写史强所在地区政府会议中官员的态度为例：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「这是小区政府的一次会议，区行政官员都到了，冬眠者约占三分之二，其余是现代人。现在可以很清楚地把他们区分开来：虽然都处于极度的抑郁状态，但冬眠者官员都在低沉的情绪中保持着常态，而现代人则都或多或少地表现出崩溃的迹象，会议开始以来，他们的情绪已多次失控，史晓明的话再次触碰了他们脆弱的神经。区最高行政长官泪痕未干，又捂着脸哭了起来，引得另外几名现代人官员同他一起哭；主管地区教育的官员则歇斯底里地大笑，还有一个现代人痛苦地咆哮起来，向地上摔杯子……」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;官员尚且如此，何况平民百姓。后面还用几万人集体淫乱、罗辑先被膜拜后被驱逐等描写，反映了人类的绝望。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;人类心态由绝望到自信再到绝望，这跌宕起伏令人唏嘘。在自信时对三体世界的那种「怜悯」，也成了巨大的笑话、人类给自己的残酷讽刺。以善意揣度对手，却落得面临毁灭的结局。地球舰队覆灭，很大程度正是在于人类的轻敌和轻信。这种轻信也来源于人们生活在文明岁月已久，对宇宙的险恶丧失了警惕，把敌人想的太美好、仁慈了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣对人类善良却被欺骗、善意导致灾祸的讥讽，并未到此为止，相反，《三体》中的人类在此后又重复了一次这样的悲剧，也就是威慑纪元后期发生的那段历史。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;人类在地球舰队覆灭和残存舰队自相残杀后，本已十分绝望，只等着地球被侵占、人类在不能生育的情况下消亡。但科学家、面壁人罗辑却巧妙利用「雪地工程」，设置了向宇宙发射太阳系及三体星系位置的系统，并以此成功迫使三体世界放弃对地球的入侵。此后，三体与地球达成和平协定，地球和三体互相传递自己的先进知识，允许地球设立数个可发射可引至黑暗森林打击的「咒语」的威慑系统，双方实现了类似于「核威慑」的平衡。人类终于转危为安。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，威慑形成、重归安全之后，人类再一次「不安分」了起来。程心在公元纪年冬眠，威慑纪年 61 年苏醒，醒来后她就看见电视上有人在谴责罗辑涉嫌「世界灭绝罪」。紧接着，她被公众拥护成为「执剑人」。而公众拥护她的原因之一，则是对罗辑这样冷酷的执剑人感到恐惧，以及对罗辑所代表的绝对权力的恐惧：&lt;strong&gt;「罗辑的形象由救世主一天一天地变成了一个不可理喻的怪物和毁灭世界的暴君」&lt;/strong&gt;。人们又由集中于解决基本生存转变为关注人权、反对极权统治。于是，就需要换下罗辑这样的人（更不愿意要维德、曹彬那样「野蛮」的公元人），选择程心这样心地善良、代表着爱与和平的女性承担这种威慑任务。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;正如这段描写：&lt;strong&gt;「看，她是圣母玛丽亚，她真的是！」年轻母亲对人群喊道，然后转向程心，热泪盈眶地双手合十，「美丽善良的圣母，保护这个世界吧，不要让那些野蛮的嗜血的男人毁掉这美好的一切。」&lt;/strong&gt;人们已经将地球舰队覆灭的惨痛抛之脑后，对美好和善良的追求再次超过了对生存安危的重视。在新老执剑人交接后，罗辑还被以「世界灭绝罪」拘捕了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;仅仅在程心持有发射作为威慑、面对三体世界入侵时应该发射的引力波信号的按钮十五分钟后，三体的「水滴」就向发射器扑去。无法面对两个星球毁灭结果的程心放弃发射会导致两个星系暴露和毁灭的引力波信号，三体的入侵已不可避免。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，呈平日久的人们并没有表现出特别的恐慌。当三体世界要求人们移民澳大利亚时，大家都没有响应。&lt;strong&gt;「直到这时，人们仍然幻想着至少一代人的平安生活，所以在智子的讲话发表后，没有一个国家响应，更没有人开始移民。」&lt;/strong&gt;人类还抱有鸵鸟的侥幸心理，直到「水滴」袭击了几座城市，造成 30 多万人死亡，人们才在恐惧中开始了迁徙。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，人们的侥幸心理还没有彻底破灭。人们还相信智子所说的，&lt;strong&gt;「三体舰队到达后，完全有能力使澳大利亚的四十亿人过上舒适的生活。同时，占领者还将帮助人类建造火星和太空中的居住空间，在舰队到达五年后就可以向火星和太空大规模移民，十五年后就能基本完成。那时，人类将拥有相对而言足够大的生存空间，两个文明将在太阳系开始新的和平生活。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;然而三体世界并不给人类存活的机会，而是一步步摧毁人类的抵抗能力、生存能力。在人们缴械、移民后，摧毁澳大利亚的工业和基础设施。再然后，就是切断电力和农业生产能力，逼迫「人相食」。&lt;strong&gt;「智子环视大厅中所有的人，「粮食？这不都是粮食？每个人看看你们的周围，都是粮食，活生生的粮食。」&lt;/strong&gt;这时的人类才知道什么是你死我活的斗争。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;借智子之口说的这段话，可以反映刘慈欣对人类生存问题的看法：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「生存本来就是一种幸运，过去的地球上是如此，现在这个冷酷的宇宙中也到处如此。但不知从什么时候起，人类有了一种幻觉，认为生存成了唾手可得的东西，这就是你们失败的根本原因。进化的旗帜将再次在这个世界升起，你们将为生存而战，我希望在座的每个人都在那最后的五千万人之中，希望你们能吃到粮食，而不是被粮食吃掉。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;刘慈欣描绘的人类两起两落的过程，是令人震撼的。他所描绘的人类在安全幸福时滋生的同情心、对警惕的放松，濒临灭亡时人类的绝望与狂乱，以及三体一步步将人类逼入灭绝境地的巧妙设计，都很能反映人性的弱点。像人类在澳大利亚被三体设计灭绝（未遂）的过程，与包括罗马人屠灭迦太基城、靖康之难（金军攻克开封）、南京大屠杀等各种屠杀的过程颇为类似（可以看看相关的记述，然后对比。或者刘慈欣就是看过这些记述才写出来《三体》中类似情节的）。这都体现了刘慈欣对人性、人的心理、对人类历史上生存斗争残酷性的深刻认识和生动诠释。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;这一节内容，我是对刘慈欣的有相当程度的正面评价的。但是本文主要是为了批评，这一段当然也有需要批评的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;其实以上这些内容，也就是刘慈欣黑暗森林理论的延续及具体化。刘慈欣的这些描述和分析确实很深刻，也与人类部分历史与现实相吻合。但是，正如前面说过的（后面也还要多次说），刘慈欣在准确描绘了某种黑暗事实的同时，却将这种黑暗合理化，并且暗示甚至明示这种现实的不可更改性，传达出一种只有放弃善良与同情心、选择残酷与狠毒才能得以生存的价值观。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;同样的事实与道理，用不同的感情倾向、描写侧重点，就导向不同的结论、达至迥然相异的目的。而根据刘慈欣字里行间的描述，以及结合全书乃至其个人在其他场合的言行，足以得出其主张在人际族际国际关系及竞争事物中摒弃善意、以恶度人、广用诈术、心狠手辣的结论。除此之外，他还借此想表达或暗示其他一些东西，放到后面再说。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在描述这部分内容时，其中还有一段耐人寻味的话：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「有学者认为，科学技术一度是消灭极权的力量之一，但当威胁文明生存的危机出现时，科技却可能成为催生新极权的土壤。在传统的极权中，独裁者只能通过其他人来实现统治，这就面临着低效率和无数的不确定因素，所以，在人类历史上，百分之百的独裁体制从来没有出现过。但技术却为这种超级独裁的实现提供了可能，面壁者和持剑者都是令人忧虑的例子。超级技术和超级危机结合，有可能使人类社会退回黑暗时代。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;很难判断刘慈欣这段话实际上所想表达的意思。根据刘慈欣惯常表现的政治观点，他并不反对现在中国的极权主义。不过这段话描写的情况却与最近十几年中国的现实非常相似。这段话很精准的论述了科技与极权主义关系的演变。互联网出现时，人们都以为将打破信息封锁促进自由民主，然而如今科技极权、数字极权却在包括中国在内的许多国家建立，包括民主国家也无法逃脱监视主义的幽灵。而中国等专制威权国家在新冠疫情下利用科技进行的高强度管控，以及未来在遏制气候变暖中各国所必须采用的集权与数字化管理，这两个事例都高度符合刘慈欣所说「威胁文明生存危机出现时，科技可能成为催生新极权土壤」的论断。那么刘慈欣对这种科技极权是否赞同呢？这是个不太好判断的问题，或者说刘对此并非简单的赞同或反对。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（八）托马斯维德&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;对这个人物的塑造，最能反映刘慈欣的社会达尔文主义思想，也可窥见刘慈欣对人的品质、价值的判断标准。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;托马斯维德出场后的第一句话，就足够震撼：&lt;strong&gt;「你会把你妈卖给妓院吗？」维德问&lt;/strong&gt;（问程心）。通过这句震撼的话和侧面描写，就把一个冷酷残忍的情报人员形象刻画了出来，也显露了维德凶阴的性格特征。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;为达目的不择手段是社会达尔文主义的典型特征，刘慈欣借维德之口有力的说了出来：&lt;strong&gt;他突然一改一贯沉稳冷淡的语调，像发狂的野兽般声嘶力竭地咆哮起来，「前进！前进！！不择手段地前进！！！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;当发送人类去接触三体世界的计划因运载重量限制而受阻时，维德冷酷的说了句「&lt;strong&gt;只送大脑&lt;/strong&gt;」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;还有这段侧面描写：&lt;strong&gt;「有两个显然也是公元人的男犯人冲程心轻佻地打口哨，但看到程心要找的人后他们立刻变得老实了，都赶紧垂头干活，好像对刚才的举动有些后怕。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心看到这人（维德）第一眼时就知道，他没有放弃，他的野心和理想，他的阴险，还有许许多多程心从来不知道的东西，什么都没有放弃。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;当然，仅仅这些还不能完全刻画出维德的冷酷残忍。刘慈欣后面还有更多笔墨在刻画维德。但仅仅从这几句，就可以让人们明白维德是个怎样的性格、形象、特质的人物了。维德这样的人物并非只是文学形象，现实中也颇有类似的真实的人。大到一个国家的领袖，小到地方豪强、黑帮首领，乃至学校和单位里既心狠手辣又有手段实力底气的人物，都与维德的某些侧面甚至整个形象吻合。一般人接触到这样的人物，免不了前胸后背头上脚下都冒冷汗，不自觉的就对其产生畏惧，即便是有些心气和能力的人也会在这样的阴狠者面前萎缩几分。如果你一开始没有怕他，那他对你施展一些招数之后，那你会比一般人对其更加恐惧敬畏。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而刘慈欣刻画的维德这样的人物，却是人类的救世主，或者说起码是救世主之一。维德不仅推动了阶梯计划，将云天明的大脑送向三体世界，最重要的是研究了光速飞船，让人类保留了生命的火种。而且如果不是程心中间造成的「破坏」，维德和其他人完全可能将人类带出被二维化的险境，甚至一开始就不会让三体得以打破威慑威胁地球，后来一切灾难也不会发生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣把一个魔鬼般的人物赋予具有天使般的拯救力，正是想表达他借维德之口说出的&lt;strong&gt;「失去人性，失去很多；失去兽性，失去一切」，以及「不择手段的前进」。&lt;/strong&gt;或者将两句话折合，就是说只有不择手段、不顾人性人权才能胜利，顾忌道德和手段、被人性人权束缚，那就只能失败。这是典型的社会达尔文主义观点，或者说不仅是社会达尔文主义观点，而是社达主义中最为阴恶的那一面，即邪必胜正、祛善扬恶才能生存。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;这一点在刘慈欣的三体全篇中有许多出展现，对维德的刻画描写则是这种观点的集中体现。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;那么，这样的观点对吗？如果我们纵观人类乃至万物历史，这在很大程度的确是一个客观现实。不谈别的只谈人类，历史上野蛮战胜文明的例子更多，还是文明消灭野蛮的更多？无疑是前者。精致雅典亡于精悍斯巴达，罗马亡于蛮族入侵，宋明亡于金元和满清，都是众所周知的事例。即便那些自诩文明也的确开创了文明的力量，其崛起与辉煌又何尝不是建立在野蛮残暴、不择手段之上的呢？对古罗马来说，背信弃义的在迦太基人解除武装后将之屠灭，是其称霸地中海的关键；李世民先发制人（当然某些史料看是「自衞反击」，只不过……），发动玄武门之变杀死李建成李元吉及其子嗣，才有了后来「天可汗」的贞观之治。除了这些恢宏的历史，市井之中又有多少「好人不长寿，坏人害千年」的例证呢？「卑鄙是卑鄙者的通行证、高尚是高尚者的墓志铭」，早就有人对此做过精辟深刻的总结。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;所以，刘慈欣借维德之口所说的，某种程度确实是现实。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;可现实并不代表正确、应当。相反，人类文明发展至今，恰恰是在一次次对野蛮的鞭挞、对丑恶的克服中实现的。如果没有对恶的批判与克制，人类如今还在日复一日的相互攻伐中，斩首截肢炮烙凌迟还是家常便饭，人类也不可能沐浴在相对的和平与发展之中。正是无数人对于善的坚守，才让恶一步步被限制和压缩，起码大恶大祸只在少部分地区少部分人那里不幸的发生，而大多数人都可以相对和平宁静的度过人生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;所以，刘慈欣在三体中所暗示甚至宣扬的极端社达主义观点（没错，是极端社达而不是一般社达），我们只能「扬弃」，知其现实性但更要遏制其现实性，认识到不择手段的可怕后更要坚守良知和理性，去抑制丑恶的滋长与残忍的再生。我们即便是恶留下的产物，也不应该延续恶以生存。就像某种程度，我们都是远古至近现代各种强奸行为（或者准确说是非自愿性行为）而产生的后代（谁敢说自己所有祖先都是合意性交的产物吗？），我们都是强奸犯的后人，但是我们肯定不应该讴歌赞颂强奸，而是坚决的批判与唾弃之。像日本 731 部队和纳粹德国进行的活人人体实验，都取得了非常巨大的医学、科学研究成果，并且造福着现在的人类，但这完全不能因此而为之粉饰美化、不能将其正当和合理化，更不能允许类似暴行再次发生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣并不是（或者起码不会公开承认是）极端社达主义主张的宣扬者，但是在客观上无疑是暗示甚至说明示了这样的价值取向和价值选择。与欧美乃至中国许多描绘黑暗和坏人不择手段的文学艺术作品不同，那些作品是为了鞭挞丑恶讴歌正义，而刘的《三体》却是在描绘黑暗与不择手段的同时千方百计进行合理化甚至颂扬，将之表现为一种悲壮的、伟大的、对延续人类生存发展而言唯一可解的价值与实践。这就很值得警惕与批判了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;关于刘的社达主义价值观，我还会在后面再做批判，现在回到对维德的评论上来。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣对维德这个人物的刻画也是很正面的，他虽然描绘了此人那么多凶恶阴险之处，但是都是为了衬托其目的的伟大、方向的正确、行为的正当。而且，刘慈欣所描绘的维德所作所为都不是为了维德自己，而是都关系到人类的前途命运，维德成了一个谈不上「毫不利己」但明显「利人类」、不是「一身正气」但明显「两袖清风」的英雄人物，所做一切都不是私利而是出于公心。而且这样的英雄人物既让他人惧怕，但是自己却从不对任何压力低头、不畏惧谄媚任何人乃至外星生物（例如在被智子监视、人人小心翼翼的情况下大胆发言，反而故意利用这种监视），是不折不扣的大英雄。这让他一切「反人类」、「反人权」的行为看起来更加正义、无私、必要。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但现实里，像维德这样形象的人真是如此始终正直、执着、坚定、硬骨头吗？从某些方面看或者表面看的确如此，我上面说的从国家元首到黑帮头子，再到学校单位里的狠人，往往也都是威风八面，颇为强悍干练，无所畏惧。可其中绝大多数人（除非真的天下无敌）在面对比起更「硬」更「牛」的人物时，其卑躬屈膝程度往往胜于常人，因为他比常人更知道自己同类有多可怕、比自己强的同类多么不能得罪。而他们面对体制，虽然有时会做出挑衅、反叛之举以对他人显示其强悍、展示力量或仅仅为了自己的舒爽，但更多时候则会服从体制、谄媚体制，对有强制力为后盾的制度和规则有一种异乎寻常的虔敬。因为他们知道，体制的能量是无穷大的，是其个人可以利用却不能推翻的。他们绝不是对任何人、在任何事上都腰杆硬直、不卑而亢，而是由于其人格特质和生存需要，比一般人更加欺软怕硬、见风使舵、精致利己。贝利亚、戈林这样的人像不像维德？他们在斯大林、希特勒面前又是怎样一副德性（当然他们在后者们临死前又换了一副德性）？他们面对邪恶的制度和环境，是反叛与对抗，还是屈从和利用？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;还有，即便托马斯维德成为（代表）斯大林、毛泽东、希特勒、普京那样的最高领袖、独裁者（而非打手），又真的是纯洁勇敢的吗？根据现在披露的各种资料，他们很多时候远比民主国家领袖更加恐惧和虚弱。如斯大林在德国入侵时、去世之前，都表现出恐惧之情，死亡时也不真的「虎死不倒架」。电影《斯大林之死》虽有些戏剧化，但反映的事实基本无误。而毛泽东呢？李志绥的披露并不是孤证，而是可以和多方信息验证，且记录的真诚性黎安友等知名主流学者肯定。而普京在入侵乌克兰遭遇挫败后的表现，也能看出这种「硬汉」的色厉内荏。而刘慈欣塑造的托马斯维德的形象，其实与这些独裁者表面的形象如刚毅勇敢等特征相似，却有意回避这样的人内心的虚弱和恐惧。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;还有，维德这样的人真的清廉、不利己、为理想献身吗？也真有这样的人，可凤毛麟角。绝大多数像他们这样思想和行为的人并不比普通人更少欲望，且其能力手段足以得到更多非法利益，他们又怎能如柳下惠般在权力金钱美色中洁身自好？还是拿那些道貌岸然、冷酷无情的布党高层和纳粹人士为例，如雅戈达、戈培尔，看看关于他们的史书和回忆录，就知道他们比一眼可知的龌龊之人要更龌龊、明目张胆贪淫的人更贪淫（当然相比而言布党比纳粹更加心口不一和无耻贪婪）。他们会为人民奉献牺牲吗？或许某个时间点会的，但是肯定是其贪淫享乐之后，以及使用各种损人利己的方式去奉献牺牲的，绝不会像《三体》中那样悲壮的牺牲。纳粹和苏联的覆灭及曝出的内幕，也证明了其牺牲捍衞的并不是值得的东西，而是肮脏透顶。或者说像东条英机、乃木希典，这些人确实是挺无私奉献的，可是是用几千万中国人、美国人、俄国人/苏联人的生命挣得的他们的「无私」及对日本人的「伟大」。我们难道要这样的人吗？（最重要的是，这世界并非只有这种奉献和存活方式）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;可刘慈欣并不描绘这些，而是将维德以及前面的史强，描写成很清廉、寡欲、不会畏惧、不谄媚的人。当然这可以说是因为他们的操行并不是《三体》的重点，所以没必要写他们的贪婪、畏惧、谄媚那一面。于是，维德这样残忍酷虐的人物才反而显得对人类来说十分伟大，史强那样的形象也显得虽不完美但更完整真实。如果刘慈欣写出了这些人贪婪、畏惧、谄媚，其良好的形象就会坍塌，失去了刘慈欣和社达主义者所认为的人物应有的（至少表面上要有的）那套道德操行，就无法塑造出他们心目中理想的那种英雄了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;这又是当今中国文宣体制下描述历史人物的方式。以前也就是「前三十年」尤其文革那十年，对大人物、正面人物一律以「伟光正」形象示人，没有半点缺点（顶多会有一点平易近人的描写）。而现在不同，对于那些伟人、英雄、正面人物，会有意突出其一些野性、刁蛮、低素质、知识贫乏等特性，但是同时又在涉及根本廉耻的「大节」上绝不「抹黑」，这样让正面形象更加人性化、真实、有血有肉。可这种人性化、真实、有血有肉，其实是回避了许多其更多更重要的作恶甚至犯罪的事实的，是用小的「毛病」遮盖真正的龌龊肮脏，用戏剧化的顽劣带过血淋淋赤裸裸的暴行。这种描绘我在本文前面涉及「毛泽东批示」那点就提到了，刘对维德、史强这种人物的描绘方式，立场和动机与之一脉相承。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣刻画的维德这样的人物，及其他与之相关的描写敍述，都在强化「不择手段的前进」和「失去兽性、失去一切」的观点。刘不仅是在描述一种客观事实，还有主观上的赞成与褒扬，这是其与其他传世文学佳品最大不同之处，也是其最值得批判之处。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;还有，前面已经提到，刘慈欣描绘的维德和史强这样的人物，代表的是统治机构的暴力机器（或者说是他们其中之一员），是体制的维护者，而不是林冲、杨志、鲁智深这样的体制的反叛者、与国家暴力机器相对抗者。刘慈欣在《三体》中，对于叶文洁等受害者和反叛者颇有微词，但是对于人类秩序的捍衞者则不吝赞美，这也可以反映刘慈欣骨子里的保守主义特质及《三体》的保守主义立场。他们确实是社会达尔文主义者，但是其社达不是为了变革，而是为了让旧秩序更加稳固。这更显出刘慈欣及《三体》价值观的丑恶和反动。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;十分讽刺的一点是，刘慈欣及《三体》的这种捍衞体制和旧秩序的保守反动，与其所赞扬的毛泽东所持的反传统反秩序思想形成鲜明对比。刘慈欣在书中和采访场合多次对毛泽东有所赞美（或起码在提及时不贬抑批判）。毛泽东罪恶罄竹难书，文革也是亘古未有之浩劫，但是恰恰有一点可取的，就是其对体制性压迫的反抗、对传统秩序和思想意识的反叛（虽然这个过程及之后建立了恶劣的体制、更暴虐的秩序，也造成了更残酷的压迫，但前面毕竟是在对不合理的乃至丑恶的旧规则旧秩序旧道统的反叛和反抗），一种打破旧巢窠束缚的反抗精神。这可谓是毛时代文革酷虐中唯一的亮色。刘慈欣一再为毛泽东贴金、为文革作恶者及相关体制和组织洗地，却与毛主义及文革中唯一可取可敬之处背道而驰，可知其与人道主义及进步潮流多么「恰巧」的完全相逆，又与丑恶反动保守多么高度一致。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（九）程心&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心，是刘慈欣着墨最多、被《三体》及刘慈欣粉丝批判最狠、本书争议最大的人物。简单来说，她就是托马斯·维德的反面，当然详细说那就复杂多了。这个人物非常重要，也是书评的重点，所以还是要详细说。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「圣母」，是《三体》及刘慈欣粉丝最常称呼程心的词汇。当然，这并不是赞美，而是深深的鄙夷。如果了解中国互联网语境，就会知道，「圣母」这个词在中国网络上不仅不是好词，还是个特别有恶意的诋毁谩骂之词。这同样是和高度社会达尔文主义化的中国现实高度相关的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;不过，「圣母」这个词在中国互联网上的本意，倒和西方并没有特别大的差别，都是指爱心泛滥、对一切都爱与包容、反对所有仇恨和压迫的人，只是中国和西方对这种人的态度不同（好吧，准确说是「部分中国人与部分西方人对这种人的态度不同」）。在中国，这种「圣母」的定义中还包括不分是非、没有黑白对错观念、没有立场和原则、一味输出爱心和同情心的特点。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;中国人是恨透了这样的人。他们认为这种「圣母」只会坏事，出卖自己国家民族群体的利益，最终害人害己。在中国这个丛林社会，也的确会经常出现这种后果。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我总说中国、中国，难道世界不是这样吗？西方发达国家不是吗？世界的确到处存在忘恩负义、恩将仇报，西方也不乏各种「农夫与蛇」的故事在现实上演。我在前文一再说这个世界仍然是丛林世界。但是这并不代表世界上所有事情都是这样、世界所有地区所有群体都是这样的价值观和行为方式生活的，有和中国并不一样（哪怕根本上「质」一样，但是「量」上有很大区别）的、「圣母」很多且可以好心得好报的社会的。被他们攻击诋毁的西欧和美国左派中起码很大一部分就是如此。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;可是中国人对此没有同情支持，而是更加愤恨。不知道是嫉妒还是不相信，或者兼而有之（没错，这两个看起来不能同时对同一个对象兼而有之的，中国人能（又要更正下，是「部分中国人」能））。他们不愿意相信这世界上真有爱与和平，或者说极为嫉恨，于是疯狂攻击各种他们认为的「白左」、「圣母」乃至这样的虚构人物形象。而《三体》中的程心就是靶子之一。当然，痛恨程心的还有一种人，这种人后面再说。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心这个名字一出现（人物还未正式出场），就被读者谩骂（当然这是因为他们已经提前知道了后面的一些内容，或者读过了又从头看起，然后又在这里作注）。而她正式出场，也就是在云天明要被安乐死（未遂）的时候。她救下了云天明，然后说了句「你知道吗？安乐死是为你准备的」。这句话被无数人喷了无数次无形的唾沫。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;当然，看这个情节，程心是该被喷被骂，因为她做了一件缺德的事。但是如果是其他人，维德、史强、章北海、罗辑做的，这些人也就不会如此谩骂了，甚至觉得是其舍小取大的果断行为。然而程心不能这样做，因为她是「圣母」，有了道德枷锁，再做什么都要被检视。当了好人就不能干这种事，否则就是「虚伪」、「双标」，哪怕其远远不如批判者虚伪和双标。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;说到这，很多人一定觉得我这是故意在较真，一个故事情节罢了，读者也只不过是在为虚构的故事而谩骂，也就图个发泄而已。如果真是这样，我也就没必要说这些，甚至整篇文章也都没必要写了。事实当然不是这样而是相反的，文学作品及与读者的互动，深刻反映着现实世界及现实中人的判断与选择。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心参与「阶梯计划」那一部分，倒是没人喷程心，这些技术问题上也没什么可喷的，相反人们应该对其技术水平感到佩服（但是这不影响后面继续喷她），甚至还有人为刘慈欣描述的女性刻板印象而进行批评。这在中国读者中倒是少见的现象，或者后来才逐渐出现。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;然后，就是程心知道云天明给他送星星，然后竭力阻止云天明被「安乐死」然后未果的情节。程心知道了云天明对她的爱，于是想挽回一切，这顺理成章，也说明她前面让云天明安乐死并不是负心之人而是无心之过。可是，这里又是对她「虚伪」的一片骂声。她真的虚伪吗？显然不是。真正想谴责，不是应该谴责不择手段、明知云天明是程心所爱还要为完成任务（或者故意如此做一个不可笑的恶作剧）的维德吗？当然，这样说又会让大家觉得我太较真、没意思了。但是我觉得那些批判程心忽视维德的，在现实里大抵也是这么做的。谴责一个老好人没什么风险，去攻击有攻击性的人就麻烦了。而且还是前面说的，人们总是对好人求全责备，对坏人就是「他坏在情理之中没必要谴责」了。人们对艺术人物的看法，一直都是现实里的反映，只不过有时候会夸张一些，但是本质还是现实的映射。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心下一个被嘲讽的切入点，是她参与竞选执剑人并当选。人们将代表爱与和平的她选为执剑人，取代了已变得严肃坚韧的罗辑（以前他是玩世不恭的），更没有选择和维德类似的曹彬、毕云峰等人。于是这就埋下了人类丧失对三体世界威慑力的祸根。而程心在三体探测器「水滴」攻击威慑设施时的懦弱，犹疑，则成了读者密集嘲讽谩骂的焦点区域。这段表现，也是程心被攻击谩骂讥讽的核心因素，即她这种「圣母」的爱心与软弱是会坏事的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;其实，我倒对这段内容中对程心的嘲讽谩骂很能理解，也比较赞同。刘慈欣编排这段内容，某种程度也确实是有很大合理性的。对于那些被认为是「白左」、「圣母」的人，这的确是其致命缺点，虽然未必是其中每个人都有的致命缺点。善良之人总是不想伤害别人，更不愿意去毁灭、同归于尽，甚至想牺牲自己成就他人。而如果其肩负着一个国家、民族的兴亡，那这种行为就会导致全国全民族的集体沉沦或毁灭。这也的确是良善者的弱点，也是阴狠者的优势。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;可还是像我前面所说的，这是事实，但应该如此吗？为了胜利，我们一定要变成恶人吗？并不见得。我们并不是不能培养出「行霹雳手段，保菩萨心肠」的人，现实中也并不乏这样的人。二战期间，德日军队凶残无比，而美军则被视为「少爷兵」，可美军最终战胜了日军，德军在西线的失败美军也是首功。这和武器装备有关，但是美军也没普遍贪生怕死。至于当今的「白左」政治家，很多时候只是想恪守原则不让国家世界陷入冤冤相报、以暴制暴的恶性循环罢了，真的动起手来那些凶顽残暴之辈未必是对手。甚至，「白左」在正义信念下更加坚定。三百年前的罗伯斯庇尔不是「白左」吗？照样让顽固保守的旧贵族纷纷断头。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;当然，像程心这样性格和价值选择的人，的确不适合承担这种需要杀伐果断的任务。人类如果都变得软弱，丧失了警惕性与战斗性，也确实可能被那时还残存的少数疯狂顽固之徒「团灭」。刘慈欣的本意不见得是好的，但是客观上提醒了我们，在持守善意之时，也不要放下手中的剑。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;不过，从另一个角度说，以死相搏甚至同归于尽，是否真是最好的选择（无论对自己还是对整个社会乃至对对手），或者这种心态博弈是否最好的威慑？大多数《三体》和刘慈欣粉丝都会说「是」，我的看法则在是非间摇摆。确实，越是抱定同归于尽的方式，越是可能在博弈中胜出，这就是「看谁先怂」游戏的核心。但是如果没有人肯低头，那这个世界就会在不断耍弄这种游戏中毁灭。或者，各方都会因此绞尽脑汁强化自己、削弱对方，不惜代价不择手段，人类丧失良知、对对方赶尽杀绝或者绝对压制，道理永远干不过拳头，仇恨与弱肉强食在智力加持下膨胀，人类世界会变得比动物丛林更丛林。至于威慑平衡，有永远的平衡吗？不会有失控的一刻吗？这样的世界真的好吗？谁能肯定自己是最终胜利者？或者说有最终胜利者吗？那些失败者就应该仰胜利者鼻息而活吗？这是我们追求的人类文明世界吗？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是如果不这样做，那这样做的人就会胜利，就会统治群体、区域、国家、世界。那样的世界，当然是地狱。所以，为了对抗魔鬼，自己也不得不成为魔鬼。只是希望是个还不那么恶的魔鬼，或者最好是有魔鬼的手段但是却有天使的心灵。可天使的心灵在这样的博弈和生存竞争中怎可能不被污染？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心下一个被嘲讽攻击的点，与前面的原因大同小异。程心阻止了维德等人研究光速飞船，要他们放弃与政府的对抗放下武器。而这，也就注定了人类几乎全员的灭亡。而讽刺的是，她最后却成了极少数没有随太阳系二维化的幸存者之一。她的阻止导致太阳系人类的几乎全灭，却得以逃生，不被骂才怪。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;可这同样是她好心办坏事。或者，正是她好心总是办坏事，所以才更令人憎恶。如果是坏心办坏事，像维德、叶文洁，人们反而不会那么攻击谩骂了。这又是前面说过的，不再絮叨了。在这一点上，她被骂也是理所应当。可是我还是想强调其好的初衷，因为「本意是好的」已经是现实世界中稀缺的东西了，而好心办了坏事，并不总是会发生，甚至说很多情况下几率还是低于 50% 的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;其实，刘慈欣文章中也写了许多让几乎所有人都认为是程心正面的、闪光点的情节，例如放弃联合国为购买云天明送给自己的星星可以支付给她的巨款而是选择捐出、为责任冒险与云天明见面、为宇宙重启而放弃小宇宙来归还宇宙质量，这些也都得到了很多读者的称赞。可是，为什么还是有许多人谩骂程心？这两波人有重合吗？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;有部分重合。有些人就是可以将一个行为连贯的人割裂评价，肯定其某部分却唾弃其另一部分。如果其一部分值得肯定，另一部分值得唾弃，那这样当然可以且非常应该。但对不应当唾弃或者应该更加全面客观评价的，却一股脑否定，或者否定也否定不到点子上而是乱喷乱骂，就属于愚蠢或者道德败坏了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;还有一部分并不重合，其一以贯之对程心是谩骂的。除了前面我所说的嫉妒或者认为程心这种「圣母」不可信之外，还有一种原因，就更加可怕了。也就是那些恶人、恶棍，包括道貌岸然的保守主义者和青面獠牙的社会达尔文主义者。这些人谩骂程心及所有「白左」、「圣母」，是因为他们内心非常恐惧世界变的爱与和平、他们被排挤或者同化。为了他们自己继续以恶生存下去、为了他们恶的价值观永世长存，达到其各种现实利益和价值利益目的，他们要对「白左」、「圣母」百般诋毁、全面否定，批倒批臭，这样他们所推崇的丑恶价值观才能继续大行于世，这些人也才能继续如鱼得水。这样的人在世界很多，而在中国尤其多。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;值得一提的是，刘慈欣本人对他自己塑造的程心这个人物看法也颇为负面，不是说他不满意于程心这个人物形象的塑造，而是说他就是反感程心这样特质的人。所以，刘慈欣本人也属于以上那些攻击谩骂程心的人之一，且他的看法更加深刻（自己塑造的形象认识能不深刻吗），所以他的阴恶也更可怖。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;最后说一下我对程心这样的人的评价，我认为就是六四开，六分正（不是六分「对」）四分谬，其品质可嘉但价值选择很多时候不可取。如果爱与和平能解决世上一切，天下大同早就实现了。为了正义，我们不得不做些不好的准备罢。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（十）性别偏见争议&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣的《三体》出版后（尤其被翻译成英语等外文并获雨果奖之后），引发了很大的争议。其中一项争议，就是认为他在作品中有对女性的性别歧视和刻板偏见。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我在阅读了全文后，发现的确是这样的。我在前面已经说了他对叶文洁、绍琳及女红衞兵的刻画反映了歧视与偏见。其实何止如此，全书更多处及整体更是有着普遍的、明显的性别歧视与偏见。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在全书中，刘慈欣刻画了十多个主要人物形象，大多数是较为正面的人物（起码这些人「本质是好人」），这些人大都在拯救地球中付出很多牺牲并做出卓越贡献。而这些人物除了被设置为联合国秘书长的萨伊为女性外，其余均为男性，如罗辑、史强、章北海、托马斯维德、曹彬、泰勒、雷迪亚兹、汪淼、常伟思等人。即便明显属于正面形象且有较大贡献的萨伊，也属于出场次数有限的配角。而为数不多负面的形象，则几乎让女性「包揽」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;除了我前面所说的女红衞兵，后面还有专门对女性形象的丑化。在《三体》末尾部分，写到太阳系二维化、程心和艾

乘坐光速飞船离开时，其他试图逃离者发现他们时的情景：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「快看，那艘船怎么加速那么快？！」一个女人尖叫道。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「哦，天啊，里面的人会被压成肉膜的。」一个男人说。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;然后出现了另一个男人的声音：「你们这些白痴，那样的加速飞船也会被压扁！可它没有，那不是聚变发动机，那是空间曲率驱动！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「曲率引擎？！光速飞船？！光速飞船！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「看来传闻是真的了，他们自己在秘密建造光速飞船，自己逃跑……」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「啊呀呀呀呀！啊！！啊！！！」这是第一个女人的声音。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「前面的，拦截它！撞死它！！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;又是那个女人的声音，「啊！他们能达到逃逸速度，他们能逃掉！他们能活！！啊啊啊！！我要光速飞船！！拦住它呀！掐死里面的！！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;对女性的丑化不言而喻。此外，还有一些不为人注意的负面形象的小人物，例如驱赶走罗辑的居委会主任也是女性（当然现实中居委会主任大多数的确是女性）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;还有对女性的物化。例如罗辑的妻子庄颜，就是一个被高度物化的女性形象。当然，这不完全是刻板偏见，而是刘慈欣为剧情需要（如衬托罗辑性格及其变化）有意设计的人物形象。但是反过来说，其他丑化女性的人物和故事情节设置就不是必须的了，负面人物不是必须设置为女性的了（可刘慈欣却这样设置了）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心这个「成事不足败事有余」的「圣母」形象，就是女性，而且书中若隐若现的暗示正是她的女性气质（「圣母」），让她「败事」了。这在前面专门分析程心那一节已有阐述分析，就不重复了。程心也是刘慈欣在《三体》中，将性别歧视与刻板偏见渗透最悄然而深入的女性人物形象。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而与程心性格脾气相反的女科学家柯曼琳，则是那种粗鲁的、且还喜欢雌竞（女人难为女人）的女人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「用资源改变原理？」一个叫柯曼琳的上了年纪的法国女人用轻蔑的口吻说，她是来自欧洲航天局的高级顾问，觉察到了男人们集中到程心身上的那种眼光，她感到很不舒服。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;又响起几声笑，柯曼琳笑得最响，「亲爱的，你给我们提供了一个卡通式的场景……」在越来越多的笑声中，她接着说，「你最好重做一遍大一的作业，算算推重比。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;男人们的目光依次从程心身上移开了，现在他们终于开始认真考虑她所说的话，对她的欣赏暂时顾不上了，只有柯曼琳始终盯着程心看，好像不认识她似的。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;她把文件举了几秒钟，并没有把它递给谁，而是狠狠地摔在地上。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「见鬼！」柯曼琳气急败坏地大叫。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「你，还有你」，维德指指程心和柯曼琳，「以后不允许出现这样没有意义的精神失控」。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;由于篇幅问题及相关内容分布的琐碎，所以我无法将《三体》中所有对女性的歧视和偏见一一列举，但是以上的例子已经足够，其他的读者们其实也都看过，并不需要我一一列举和重复。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;这些可以说毫无疑问是性别歧视和偏见。但是，这是不是某种程度的客观事实呢？即女性是否的确是这样的？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;以我的个人意见，首先，根本上说，刘慈欣刻画的这些女性的负面所作所为及负面人格特质，尤其各种丑恶言行，是男女共有的，并非女性独有。其次，的确在某些程度上某些情况下，女性在某些方面的确有一些与上述被丑化或刻板化的形象或言行等，存在某种有别于男性的特质。但是，程度远没有刘慈欣这样刻画的严重。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而且，究竟是她们天生就如此，还是男权社会将其塑造和规训成这些样子？这个问题很重要，非常重要。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我认为，这当然是后天社会环境塑造的结果，而非先天必然的情形。女性在有些事情中、情境下存在较突出的偏狭、反智、物化、柔弱，是被社会准确说是男权社会所制造、诱引、逼迫出来的，刘慈欣的《三体》就是参与制造、诱引、逼迫的其中一份子。这就像说「农民工文化素质低」，并不是农民工素质天生就低，而是他们往往处在恶劣的家庭、社会环境中，没有条件得到良好的教育和良善的外部环境塑造，他们是受害者而不是天然的低素质劣根分子。我们要做的是同情和改变，以及对造成这种后果的人或制度环境进行谴责，而非对这些受害者鄙夷讥讽、指指点点。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;同理，女性出现一些偏狭、反智、物化、柔弱的特性，并不是歧视女性的理由，不是男权社会压迫女性、归罪女性的借口，相反她们是受害者，她们这样反而需要男权社会承担责任，通过对制度、文化、习惯的改变，缩小甚至消除非生理的性别差异，实现真正的男女平等和性别正义。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;特别需要强调的是，我所说的男女在某些特质上的差异，其差异程度是远小于男性内部、女性内部的差异的，也普遍小于不同教育水平、不同收入水平的群体之间的差异。无论生理还是非生理方面，男女的共性都远大于「个性」或者说特异性，非生理方面尤其如此。对性别差异，人们可以讨论、有各自的观点，但是不应该因此限制、迫害任何性别（包括跨性别者）的各种基本人权和学习工作生活各项事务中的自由选择权。以这些非自愿性差异来评断、规训、责备男女或其他任何性别/性别认同者，都是谬误的、应被批判的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;那么，《三体》中有这样多的性别歧视和偏见，是不是代表刘慈欣本人有这样的性别歧视和偏见呢？答案显然是肯定的。刘慈欣在采访中否认了这一点，但是其否认并不成立，因为与事实相违背。或者说，即便刘慈欣没有主观上歧视的故意，也有客观上歧视的实质。刘慈欣在展示被认为在女性身上比较凸显的某些特质时，显然是歧视性的立场，而非认为需要同情和改变的态度，更不是为了特意以此揭露和批判男权社会对女性的影响和规训。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;此外，刘慈欣还曾经在一场和学者江晓原的辩论中假设，如果世界末日，只剩下他、江晓原和现场一位女主持人，「我们三人携带着人类文明的一切，而我们必须吃了她才能够生存下去，你吃吗？」刘慈欣站在「吃」的一方。虽然这很大程度只是个假设，但刘在假设中将对象设置为「美女」（即便当时他们身边确实有个女主持人），即一位女性，本身就含有将女性作为牺牲品的意思。即便不深究，这也足以反映刘慈欣对女性的某种不良的心理和价值取向。即便作为玩笑，也是不合适的。而且刘慈欣还认真的和江辩论，说明他并没当成个玩笑，而是将假设当真的一般对待。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（十一）大众的形象&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣在《三体》中，对人民大众不仅没有赋予团结、勇敢等特质，反而给予了极为强烈的贬低与鄙夷。在刘慈欣笔下，大众是自私的、盲从的、虚弱的、野蛮的，是不折不扣的「乌合之众」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;除了前文提及的红衞兵批斗叶哲泰、地球二维化时女逃难者喊叫，还有不少反映大众劣性的情节。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;例如罗辑根据黑暗森林法则预测的一个恒星被摧毁，此事公开时正逢星际舰队毁灭，大众把罗辑当成神一样的人进行朝拜以图在危机中幸存：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「看到罗辑停下，人群便向他移动过来，在距他两三米处，前排的人极力阻挡住后面人群的推进，然后跪了下来，后面的人也相继跪下，发光的人群像从沙滩上退去的海浪般低了下去。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「主啊，救救我们吧！」罗辑听到一个人说，他的话引起了一阵嗡嗡的共鸣。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「我们的神，拯救世界吧！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「伟大的代言人，主持宇宙的正义吧！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「正义天使，救救人类吧！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;……」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;当罗辑表现出无法解决危机后，人们对他的看法及对待他的方式发生 180 度大转弯：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在一个冷雨霏霏的秋天的下午，新生活五区的居民代表会议做出了一个决定：将罗辑驱逐出小区，理由是他影响了该区居民的正常生活。在雪地工程期间，罗辑常常外出参加会议，但大部分时间还是在小区里度过的，他就在自己的居所中同雪地工程的各个机构保持联系。罗辑恢复面壁者身份后，新生活五区就处于戒严之中，居民的生活和工作都受到影响。后来，随着罗辑地位的衰落，对小区的戒严也渐渐松懈下来，但情况更糟：不时有城里来的人聚集在罗辑所住的楼下，对他起哄嘲骂，还向他的窗子扔石块，而新闻媒体对这景象也很感兴趣，往往来的记者和抗议者一样多。但罗辑被驱逐的真正原因，还是冬眠者们心中对他彻底的失望。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;面对着这个已经耗尽了一切的人，主任并没有丝毫的怜悯。和那个时代的其他人一样，她总觉得不管世界多么黑暗，总在冥冥之中的什么地方存在着终极的公正，罗辑先是证实了她的感觉，然后又无情地打碎了它，对他的失望曾令她恼羞成怒，她冷冷地宣布了会议决定。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「呀，他好像是面壁者呀！」于是孩子的父母也都回头看他，他只好承认自己就是罗辑。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;这时，车内响起了《山楂树》。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;车停了下来，「下去。」孩子的父亲冷冷地说，母亲和孩子看他的眼光也如外面的秋雨般冰凉。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;罗辑没有动，他想听那首歌。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「请下去。」那男人又说，罗辑读出了他们目光中的含义：没有救世的能力不是你的错，但给世界以希望后又打碎它则是一种不可饶恕的罪恶。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;一路上很顺利，但一个多小时后还是有人认出了罗辑，于是车里的人一致要求他下车。罗辑争辩说自己已经输入信用点买了票，当然有权坐车。有一个头发花白的老者拿出两枚现 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;在已经很不常见的现金硬币扔给了他，他还是被赶下了车。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「面壁者，你背把铁锹干什么？」车开时有人从车窗探出头问。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「为自己挖墓。」罗辑说，引起了车里的一阵哄笑。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;面壁者、民粹主义者、委内瑞拉总统雷迪亚兹，在结束面壁回到祖国时，被知道他试图用同归于尽方式对抗三体的民众乱石砸死：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;雷迪亚兹高举双手，含着热泪对着拥向他的人潮深情地呼唤道：「啊，我的人民！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;他的人民扔来的第一块石头打在他高举的左手上，第二块石头击中了他的前胸，第三块砸在前额上并击倒了他。随后，人民的石头像雨点般飞来，最后几乎埋住了他那早已没有生命的躯体。砸向面壁者雷迪亚兹的最后一块石头是一位老太太扔的，她吃力地举着一块石头一直走到雷迪亚兹的尸体前，用西班牙语说：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「恶人，你要杀所有的人，那里面可是有我的孙子，你竟想杀我的孙子！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;说着，她用尽力气，颤巍巍地把手中的石头砸到雷迪亚兹从石堆中露出的已经破碎的头颅上。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;还有一些细节，也能看出刘慈欣对大众的鄙视态度，例如在申玉菲丈夫魏成口述自己一些经历时夹杂的这段话：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;对来这里的游客和香客都没什么好印象，那些游客根本不知道是来看什么的，只是东跑西窜地照相；而那些香客，看上去普遍比游客穷得多，都处于一种麻木的智力抑制状态。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;最具讽刺意味的，莫过于下面这段描述人类在星际舰队毁灭后悲观绝望，所以十万人聚集在一起进行裸体性派对的情景：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;整个广场上白花花的一片，那些白色的颗粒蠕动着，像一锅煮着的大米粥。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「那都是人吗？」罗辑疑惑地问。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「裸体的人，这是超级性派对，现在人数已过十万，还在增加。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;当然，刘慈欣也在本书中描绘了一些平民大众人性的善良与大爱。例如在描写太阳系二维化时有这么一段：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在飞船 A.I.拉出的一个放大画面上，可以看到一对情侣拥抱着跌入平面，二维化后的两个人体在平面上并行排列，仍能看出拥抱的样子，但姿态很奇怪，像一个不懂透视原理的孩童笨拙地画出来的。还有一位母亲，高举着自己还是婴儿的孩子跌入平面，那孩子也只比她在三维世界多活了 0.1 秒，他们的形体也生动地印在这幅巨画上。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;但是这样的描绘凤毛麟角（这都有些夸大了，似乎很正面描绘大众的只有上面这一段），绝大多数关于平民的描绘都是贬斥性质的。而且要注意到，刘慈欣对大众的赞誉仅仅指其对家庭成员的爱，而非公共领域的利他、为公。这虽然是陈述某种事实，但也可以反映出刘慈欣的保守主义思想和立场（重视传统家庭、轻忽公共领域，是保守主义的典型特征）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣对大众的描述，很符合《乌合之众》等批判大众（或者说「群众」）劣性的那些学术分析所说的那样。其他也有不少文学艺术作品表现大众的劣性，不过很少有像刘慈欣描述的这样生动、恶辣。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;刘慈欣的这些描述，确实是当今世界很多地方大众的真实一面。而在中国，大众的这种劣性更为普遍突出。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，与前面各种描述一样，刘慈欣在陈述事实的同时，并不是一种悲天悯人的态度，而是纯粹的冷嘲热讽。刘慈欣对大众的理解，不是那种深刻的同情式理解，而是嘲讽式理解。这与鲁迅那种强烈批判国民劣性，但是充满「哀其不幸，怒其不争」的悲愤同情之心、善意的出发点和落脚点，性质和导向是完全不同的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;还有重要的一点，刘慈欣所描绘的是未来的世界，且其设定的场景尤其「大低谷」时代后的人类世界，很多时候是非常发达的，人民也是善良和有素质的。那么这样的社会，是应该出现类似于现在西方发达国家那种公民社会的，民众也有一定的参政素质。但刘慈欣并没有描述任何有公民素质的大众，也没有描写公民社会（只有极少数提到类似的东西，例如市民对议员扔西红柿，还是贬抑）。相反，《三体》中却有很多英雄人物。当然，这同样可以以严苛的言论审查环境严酷来辩解。可是，根据刘慈欣在本书中及其他场合的价值取向，根本上是「非不能也，是不为也」。即便没有严苛的言论审查，他同样不会写公民社会，或者说不会写公民社会的「好」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（十二）社会达尔文主义的恢宏史诗&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;相对于粉饰独裁者、性别偏见、鄙视大众等属于刘慈欣思想「枝叶」的东西，其社达主义价值才更是刘慈欣及《三体》的「躯干」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;关于刘慈欣在《三体》中表达的社会达尔文主义倾向，并不需要我再列举新的例子，前文中那么多分析和举例，几乎处处都有社会达尔文主义色彩。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;所谓「社会达尔文主义」，核心就是「弱肉强食、适者生存」。这八个字也是自然界进化论的核心，社达则是将此从自然界搬到了人类社会之中。这八个字看起来简单，却可以包罗万象。关于社会达尔文主义的具体内容和表现，有许多分析研究，我在此就不搬运了，直接针对刘慈欣的《三体》及刘本人进行分析。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;小说的三要素是人物、环境和故事情节，可以说这三要素就等于小说的全部内容。而刘慈欣的《三体》，其人物、环境、故事情节，都充斥着社会达尔文主义。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;维德、史强、章北海，就是依靠不择手段，达成其重要的目的。而且，是必须使用在文明社会评价体系下不应该乃至坚决反对的方式，才能达成其重要目的，拯救人类。维德是典型的社会达尔文主义者，而另外两人不算完全的社达主义者，但是有时会表现出社达主义的思想倾向和行动。而程心，则是他们的反面。程心的思想和所作所为，都很合乎文明环境下的道德准则和法律要求，甚至还非常有爱心、特别善良、高风亮节，可这些德行却正是其失败、最终导致绝大多数人类灭亡的关键。借用一句诗就是「卑鄙是卑鄙者的通行证、高尚是高尚者的墓志铭」。这些当然是社会达尔文主义的特征和表现。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而文中对于环境背景的设计和描述，同样令人感知社会达尔文主义的凸出。「黑暗森林」理论及现实，就是社达色彩最为凸出之处。此外，诸如文革的背景和叶文洁的遭遇、人类与三体较量的过程、「乌合之众」即各种大众式人物在文中的表现，都在反映这个社会的残酷与黑暗，强权、恶人、心狠手辣、谎言与背信、欺软怕硬欺善怕恶……无不是在告诉读者，社会达尔文主义才是社会法则的基础和主流，也只有适应这种生存法则才能胜出或起码存活，拒绝甚至对抗社达规则，那不仅无法生存，死的连渣都不剩。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;不仅从小说基本要素看，《三体》的社会达尔文主义无处不在。按情节先后的时间和敍述顺序，社达主义也贯穿了整个小说故事的始终（虽然小说的开篇部分和回忆叶文洁经历的文革部分极少涉及三体世界，但这些人类的尔虞我诈都为后面人与三体世界斗争起了引子、做了铺垫）。人类与三体世界斗争的过程，跌宕起伏的成败得失，都与社会达尔文主义的思想和行为有关。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;人类和三体的交手过程简化后是这样：人类社会自身的不公正与迫害，催生出了叶文洁这样的反叛者。而另外的一些反叛者却是因为生活太过优越、道德感正义感太强而加入反叛邪恶人类的大军。人类反叛者引来三体世界入侵后，地球为对抗危机陷入大低谷。但大低谷之后人们痛定思痛「给岁月以文明」，实现复苏。但复苏后人类丧失了警惕性与危机感。同时，三体世界在得知人类思维的不透明后，学会了欺骗，成功的让人们麻醉在和平的幻梦中，然后在星际战役中一举击败了人类。而人类通过建立黑暗森林威慑体系，又从绝境中复苏。但复苏后「故态复萌」，再次因为强调道德和「人权（这里‘人权’也包括其他星球生命权）」而放松警惕、变得柔弱和不设防，选择了程心这种「圣母」做「执剑人」。然后人类因此再一次几乎落败。可获胜的代价则是让地球和三体世界都暴露在宇宙的黑暗森林打击目标中。而人类再次因为强调道德和「人权」丧失了逃脱黑暗森林打击的机会，最终除极少数人之外都走入死亡。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;显然，这一切体现了社会达尔文主义的社会现实及社达思想在现实层面的胜利。被道德和法律禁锢就会失败，顺应人性乃至宇宙恶的一面就能生存。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;一部小说的思想意识，很大程度（甚至是完全）就是作者本人自己的思想意识。《三体》浓厚的社会达尔文主义思想，大抵也是其本人所赞成和拥有的。而且，刘慈欣的作品中，并不是只有《三体》这一部如此。在刘慈欣另一部作品《球状闪电》中，同样有明显的社会达尔文主义气息。例如女主角林云就是通过同归于尽式的方式，逼迫敌人放弃入侵，让自己国家赢得了战争胜利（或者说从失败边缘挽回危机，实现停战）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;《球状闪电》中，还有更加露骨的社达主义倾向的内容。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「是啊，爸爸，当时听完我的话，您默默地看了我好一会儿，然后从公文包中拿出两张照片，两张一模一样的照片，只是有一张的一角烧焦了，另一张上面有些褐色的痕迹，后来知道那是血迹。照片上是一个三口之家，父母都是军官，但他们的军装与爸爸的很不一样，戴着当时爸爸还没有的肩章，那女孩儿岁数和我差不多，是个很漂亮的小孩儿，皮肤白里透红，像个细瓷似的，在北方生长的我从来没见过那么好的皮肤，她的头发那么黑那么长，一直拖到腰间，好可爱的。她的妈妈也很漂亮，爸爸十分英俊，真是让我羡慕的一家人。可您告诉我，这是两个敌军军官，都在我们的炮击中阵亡了，打扫战场时分别从两具尸体上找到这两张相同的照片，现在，中间的那个可爱的小女孩儿没有妈妈，也没有爸爸了。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;将军说：「我还对你说，那些杀死你妈妈的敌人并不是坏人，他们那么做因为他们是军人，必须尽自己的职责，就像爸爸是军人，也要在战场上尽职责去杀死敌人一样。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;南疆战场上，我的一个战友被它的尾巴舔了一下，结果他身上的皮一碰就掉下来，活着还真他妈不如死了，就在野战医院，他趁人不注意用手枪自我了结了。当时我就想到最后在医院见到的妈妈，她全身的皮肤也都溃烂了，她的手指肿胀发黑，连用手枪自我了断都不可能……这经历可能会使一些人一生远离武器，却也会使另一些人迷上它，我属于后者，恐怖的机器潜藏着一种力量，正是这种力量像毒品一样迷住了我。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「云啊，我们两个女人，为了理想和信仰，为了祖国，走上了这条本不该女人走的人迹罕至的路，在这路上我走得比你长，所以对它的凶险知道得更多一些。自然界中的各种力量，包括人们认为最轻柔最无害的那些力量，都可能变成毁灭生命的武器，而这些武器中有一些之残酷之恐怖，你不亲眼看到是无法想象的。但我，一个你认为像你妈妈的女人还是要告诉你，我们的路没有错，我对自己的一生无怨无悔，希望你到我这个年纪时也能这样。孩子，我已搬到一个你不知道的地方，以后也不会再和你联系了，在告别之前，我不送你空洞的祝福，祝福对一个军人来说毫无意义，我只给你一个警告：那些可怕的东西，可能有一天会落到你的同胞和亲人的头上，落到你怀中婴儿娇嫩的肌肤上，而防止这事发生的最好办法，就是抢在敌人或潜在的敌人前面把它造出来！孩子，这就是我所能给你的祝福了。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;这些文字究竟在传达什么信息，不同的人出于不同的价值观和利益，会有不同的诠释。但是，说其具有社达色彩是完全站得住脚的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;需要补充一下，最具震撼性的社达词句是这个：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;「斩尽杀绝，这是对一个文明最高的重视。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;除了书中的东西，刘慈欣还在现实中有所表现。前面已经提到他在和一位学者辩论「为延续人类文明要不要吃人」的话题时，倾向于为达成人类延续的目的不惜吃人的「不择手段」立场。此外，他在接受一些采访时，也表达过一些倾向，例如赞同新疆「再教育营」政策。当然，他也表现出过一些中性的态度。例如在接受一位媒体人李佳佳采访时，其评论事情就没有明显的情绪，而是温和理性，说的也颇务实中立。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;正如我开篇所说，我当然没能力透视般看到刘慈欣脑子里边究竟在想什么，一切只是根据情理的推测。我评价其为社会达尔文主义者或者社达主义的支持者，我认为还是符合事实的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;回到《三体》，这部书可以说充分体现了社会达尔文主义的种种特征和表现，最重要的是，书中对于社达主义或者说「弱肉强食、不择手段」是倾向于支持同情而非批判反对的。这也是其与其他反映人性黑暗、社会丑恶的作品所不同的。这又是前面已经谈过的了，但是确实还是有必要再说一次。所以，综合《三体》的内容广度深度、思想倾向、暗示主张、现实影响，足可称其为「社会达尔文主义的恢宏史诗」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;其实，之所以认为《三体》是社会达尔文主义思想，很大程度在于它的读者中有很大比例是社会达尔文主义者，他们崇拜黑暗森林法则，对托马斯维德、史强、章北海等人十分佩服，推崇书中「失去兽性，失去一切」的思想，进而对《三体》全书强烈推崇、对刘慈欣高度崇拜。。正是这些人的理解与解读，让本书原本就有的社会达尔文主义色彩更加浓厚。这也正是我要说的，《三体》的火热不仅在于书中内容本身的吸引力，还在于其与现实中国人的价值观相辉映，昭示着 21 世纪中国高知群体社会达尔文化的客观现实。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;值得注意的是，2019 年底至今中国爆发新冠疫情后，经济形势急剧恶化，除极少数人外绝大多数人生活普遍艰难。这给了社会达尔文主义者一记重击，让他们发现「有本事」、「奋斗」仍然不能得到收获。这导致社达主义有所衰落，而又刺激了中国青年毛派的崛起。但是如今中国青年毛派仍然具有强烈的社达情结。巧合的但某种程度也必然的，刘慈欣的《三体》不仅迎合了社达主义者，也迎合了青年毛派，所以《三体》在疫情爆发的当下依旧火热。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（十三）「是什么」之后「怎么办」？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;显然，我已经将一些问题重复的敍述、分析了。所以在综述部分，我也就不再重新列举内容，而是根据前面已写内容为基础评论分析。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;综合我在以上具体敍述分析中强调的重点，我对于刘慈欣所说的各种黑暗丑陋的现实存在是承认的；而在这样现实的成因和责任问题上，我和刘慈欣的观点有分歧；但在如何对待这样现实的问题上有根本不同（哪怕有些非质的层面恰恰完全一致）。也就是说，「是什么」上我和刘慈欣观点某种程度很相近，在「为什么」上有重大分歧，在「怎么办」上的选择有质的不同。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;借用几句俗语谚语名言来概括「是什么」，就是「君子斗不过小人」、「卑鄙是卑鄙者的通行证，高尚是高尚者的墓志铭」、「你在凝视深渊时（与恶结怨，交锋），深渊也在凝视着你（可能在反抗中变成一样恶的人，反之可称为‘宽顺者’）」、「好人不长寿，坏人万万年」……那么，我们到底要做「君子」、「高尚者」、「宽顺者」、「好人」，还是去做「小人」、「卑鄙者」、「恶人」、「坏人」？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;如果在这样的简单条件下，人们还可能有许多选择前者的，那么再逐次增添条件，即失败者者重要利益受损/很在乎的东西被损害呢？严重受损/很在乎的东西严重受损呢？自身无法生存呢？国破家亡、重于生命的东西也会被以残酷方式毁灭呢？还选择前者吗？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;如果再增加条件，好人未必完全好，坏人未必完全坏；好事未必全是利，坏事未必全是弊。选择做「小人」那一串有了更多冠冕堂皇的辩解理由，那又如何选择？然后还能增加许多加大或「减轻」选择难度（「减轻」选择难度未必是真的「减轻」）的条件，然后又如何选择？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;这类讨论并不鲜见，尤其在进入现代社会后、思想自由的发达民主国家。但这些讨论并没有一个确定的共识。而中国这样的国家则鲜少类似讨论，但是现实中却不断的上演着这样的选择（虽然未必像所述那些谚语所说的善恶正误那么分明），至于选了什么应该众所周知。当然也不止中国，全人类每个国家每个人都会面临这些选择。而刘慈欣的《三体》，则是将这样的问题更加深刻和尖锐的提了出来。维德的话「失去人性，失去很多；失去兽性，失去一切」，则是刘慈欣针对问题给出的浓缩版答案。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;现实的选择当然更加复杂，可是总是有相对的正邪与胜负、善恶与兴衰。我们在很多时候，尤其攸关个体、家庭、社群、国家、人类命运的时候，往往必须要选择。我们每个人人生都可能会参与这种选择甚至参与许多次这样的选择。或许我们不需要丧心病狂，并不是每一次都选择为生存而变得邪恶，可终究不会干干净净。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;（因 matters 字数所限，最后一章（关于刘慈欣」，在评论区补充）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h2&gt;微故事: 穷人的选择 (东加豆)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/5ed90da1-e96c-449e-96ed-b23201a9dfe9.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韦跟著一个陌生人去了一个陌生的地方，那里一片白茫茫，纯净和美好，空中有白色的云朵在漂浮，阳光穿透云层，洒下金黄色的光芒，一切仿佛是天堂一样，陌生人就像使者。李韦心中带著好奇和喜悦，因为这些都只有在梦境或电影才会遇见的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;后来，李韦知道自己死了，陌生地方真的一个天堂，而陌生人真是一个使者。使者告诉他，因为医疗失误，所以他的死了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;是这样的，医务人员将一名癌症病人的档案错放进李韦的档案中，当李韦知道自己得了癌症后，心灵晴天霹雳，他无法承受突如其来的事实，三天后就心脏病发死了。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这种医疗失误简直是混账! 李韦心中的惊慌和痛苦，一时无法用言语来形容，人生实在太可笑，他的生命就这样被误摧毁！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，上天总喜欢与人开玩笑，问题是会接二连三，不知道李韦是福还是祸，人有人的犯错，使者也会犯错。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;是这样的，使者把一名时辰到快要死的人，错误放入了李韦的生死册中，事实，李韦还未到期死的，可是，当使者试图将李韦的灵魂送回他的身体时，李韦的遗体已经被火化成了灰烬。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这时，使者为自己的失误而抱歉，迫不得已给李韦一个大特卖，并告诉李韦，他可以选择任何一个即将要死的人，延续他的生命，以后，李韦将会成为那个人了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韦听到使者的说话，心情犹如翻江倒海，既惊喜又忐忑不安，这是难以想象人生的转变。李韦想到自己穷一生，霉一世，他竟然得到重新选择自己的身份的机会，这就像得到宝物没两样。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;他脑海中不断闪现过去的经历，和梦想的画面。比如看著银行帐户余额是就懊恼，在公家医院轮候十小时的可悲，在公众场合从不会成为别人的焦点等等。李韦内心越来越兴奋，他急不及待地想要开始新的生活，摆脱过去的日子，他开始思考该选择谁。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;如果当一名医生，他守护人生命的力量，救死扶伤，使病人恢复健康，摆脱痛苦，让人带有希望！这种专业造福人群，对世界非常有贡献，如此德高望重。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韦医生！噢...太让人兴奋了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;律师也不错。律师在社会扮演正义与秩序的重要维护者。 律师能够解决纷争，保护公民权益，促进法制建设。这种专业有高度的智维和挑战性，律师可以拯救世人，对世界非常有贡献，律师也有强烈的成就感和使命感。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韦大律师！哦...叫人激动了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;如果当政客呢？政客和人民是息息相关的，是不可分割。因为政客可以通过政策的制定，影响社会的发展方向，让人民享受生活美好的氛围，安居乐业，家庭和睦。这种专业绝对是实现个人抱负和理想，对社会有高度的影响力，是非常有成就感的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韦首长官！哇...真叫人心跳加速！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛学者｝也不错，醉心学术研究，追求真理，扩展人类的知识边界。沉浸在理论研究与实践的探索。学者代表了某一种权威，是培养下一代，也是引领者，专业是学者的魅力所在，其持续学习与分享知识的精神满足。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;｛建筑师｝有贡献，｛会计师｝有贡献，｛艺术家｝也有贡献。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;艺术家啊！绘画、雕塑、音乐、舞蹈等，传达了人性的复杂情感与生活的美态。艺术家享受探索、创新和突破界限，作品更可能影响深远，触动人心，充满激情与灵感，满足了人的追求、解放和精神需要！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韦...大艺术家！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;使者找了几个将要死的人，李韦马上指著那名医生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;可是，当使者的手轻轻触摸著水晶球时，他看到了李韦的过去，使者带著可惜的语气说道：｛你不能上他的身！因为你曾经斥骂他们！｝&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韦却不明白，他从未见过这个人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;使者清楚地说，因为李韦斥骂医生，他几乎每次见完医生之后就会斥骂他们！即使在电视上看到不认识的医生就会大骂一顿。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;比如：这医生没有医德！他只不过是追求名利和地位，只是以此来证明自己的价值。滥用医疗资源、忽视病人权益、滥药、做不必要手术！垃圾！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韦说过每一句说话，都在水晶球再次浮现。李韦感到无地自容，尴尬非常。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;使者马上安慰他，不必难过，几乎每个人都是这样的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韦心里著急，时间一秒一秒地过去，使者却安然淡定，始终每一秒钟有千千万万正在会死去的人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韦马上指著一名快要死的律师。年轻有为，在法律界的天空中渐渐升起，突如其来一场车祸，这样死去未免太可惜了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;可是，当使者的手触摸著水晶球时，他看到了李韦生前说过一些话，使者可惜地说道：｛你不能上他的身！因为你曾经斥骂他们！｝然后，水晶球发光了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛他们只是利用法律漏洞，获取利益而牺牲弱者的权益，甚至与犯罪集团勾结，违反职业道德，泄漏委托人的隐私或商业机密。法律只是帮有钱人办事的，见钱眼开！人渣！｝&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这些话都是李韦不只说过一次，是超过一百次，只要有媒体出现任何律师，他都会不停地指著他们斥骂，直到他心情静下来。那么，这意味著他不能找任何律师的身体，李韦心中已经冒汗了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;政客、建筑师、会计师、学者等，李韦通通都骂过了，尤其是政客，李韦天天都在骂，在报纸上骂，在电视上骂，甚至在街上看到那些选举海报，他更斥骂连连。｛贪腐、滥用权力、忽视民生、玩弄权术、践踏制度、破坏社会进步，下流！）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韦已经心中有数了，他不会再寻找这些专业人士的身体了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，尽管喜欢看电影，听音乐，看表演，哪些艺人没有被他斥骂过？画家、音乐家、舞蹈家、电影明星等等。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;（这个人只不过是虚有其表的。虚伪的、整容的、作状的、假的、丑闻、抄袭的、没有实力的...）总之，李韦就是喜欢看到他们的负面消息，而且深信不疑，更会四处宣扬。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;虽然，世界在每一秒钟都有千千万万人将会死去，可是李韦的时间并不多，似乎使者又弄错了，李韦只剩下五分钟时间。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;使者对著水晶球发力。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;终于，他发现，有一种人，李韦从未骂过的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韦，从不骂｛穷人！｝&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;最后，他在一个｛穷人｝的身体，上他身了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;完!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;写作日期：2024 年 3 月 22 日&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;开始时间 : 11:00am&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;完成时间 : 16:22pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;图.文. 东加豆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;我除了写微故事，还制作有声书，希望我们能互相认识。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;喜欢我的文章吗？盼得到您的支持、点赞，或分享我的文章，让我知道创作的路上有你陪伴。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E8%88%87%E9%BC%93%E5%8B%B5/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/支持与鼓励/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;关于我：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;故事选集&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://matters.town/@tonkabean/collections&quot;&gt;https://matters.town/@tonkabean/collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFT 收集&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://liker.land/zh-Hant/like1cdavnkhzj8wsaeafmyqctrs9952q4hgk6tpael?tab=created&quot;&gt;https://liker.land/zh-Hant/like1cdavnkhzj8wsaeafmyqctrs9952q4hgk6tpael?tab=created&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;东加豆贴文生活 What&#39;s App Channel~~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;你的追踪, 就是我的动力.

            <title>「唯一不可原谅的罪是刻意的残忍」</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;最近看了一部美剧，《宿敌》第二季（Feud: Capote vs. The Swans Season 2）。描写作家卡波特与纽约上流社会贵妇之间的恩怨。卡波特不仅文笔好，而且极为洞悉人心，能说会道。在贵妇们需要安慰时体贴入微，为她们排忧解惑；八卦起来又毒舌刻薄，舌绽莲花；俏皮、冷血和小丑般的做作。他因此很讨上流社会空虚的贵妇的欢心，成为她们的宠物、知心大姐和情感依靠。按现在巧伪的说法，能提供极大的「情绪价值」。在他的攻势面前，她们毫无招架，纷纷向他毫无保留地敞开心扉，与他分享自己的秘密。他还是同性恋，贵妇们的老公也很放心，乐得他陪伴自己的妻子，省去不少烦心事。他因此在上流社会社交圈如鱼得水，成为大红人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/c4381e0e-8c34-4960-9f80-868882dc9a9f.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;卡波特确实对这些空虚的贵妇有惊人的洞见，他称这些贵妇为天鹅，向他的相好揭示出她们的本质，她们「在水面上美丽而娴静，动人、独一无二、滑过社会的池塘/但是上帝给了她们太多的包袱，你看，在清澈的水面下，她们必须加倍有力地划水才能像一只普通的鸭子一样漂浮着/这是一个只有一些人能承受的巨大负担/你知道，有些天鹅会因为美丽的外表以及它们表面奇异的羽毛的重量而淹死」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/1ab7fa7a-31b3-4fad-b3c6-d951468c97a0.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;但他也是利用这些贵妇。为了金钱或者为了表现自己不世的才华，将这些贵妇家中的丑闻写成故事公开发表，名字都没改。从而与贵妇圈子反目成仇，被逐出了上流社会社交圈。她们痛骂他是「宫廷基佬小丑」。但在相互的伤害中，又都挺怀念过去的美好时光。离不开对方，对对方有极大的依恋和不舍，分离对双方都是折磨。卡波特不断乞求回到她们身边；贵妇们一边想念他，又不肯原谅他。就这样相爱相杀。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;其中有个贵妇痛斥卡波特背信弃义的话，特别精辟，「唯一不可原谅的罪是刻意的残忍」，而这本来是贵妇引自卡波特的一本小说。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/e48b3a71-c4d2-42fd-9283-da103c50208e.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;这让我想起了最近发生的一起恶性案件。河北省邯郸市三名初中生残忍杀害同学的案件，披露出的暴行令人发指，头皮发麻。三名罪犯的暴行完完全全是「刻意的残忍」，不止谋财害命。他们是如此的冷血、麻木；把自己的快乐建立在他人的痛苦之上，以吞噬他人的痛苦来获得快感。他们反社会、反人类，对生命有一种本能的仇视，以扼杀生命为快乐。根本上，他们仇视自己的生命，对自己来到这个世上充满了怨恨。因而想毁灭他人，毁灭自己。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;那么这种怨恨从何而来，是残酷的环境带来的？在他们短短的人生中，从来没有得到过温暖和爱意，还是天生如此？这是一个极其深奥的问题，我以为两方面因素都存在。但无论如何，这是不可原谅、不可饶恕的罪行。因为他们的罪行是「刻意的残忍」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2024 年 3 月 22 日&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>论语漫读（37）：是亦为政 — 广义的政治与狭义的政治</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.red-publish.com/book/2990&quot;&gt;电子书：《论语漫读》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;或谓孔子曰：「子奚不为政？」子曰：「《书》云：‘孝乎惟孝，友于兄弟，施于有政’。是亦为政，奚其为为政？」 &lt;/strong&gt;（为政第二）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f4d8dc70-a36d-47e5-8c2d-30b31f03ce9e.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;孔子天天给学生讲当官施政的学问。就有人感到奇怪，或者暗地挤兑孔子，问孔子，「你怎么不去从政呢？」言下之意是，你行你上呀！这个得看具体的情景。到底是哪种情况，不得而知。不过，这话问得没道理。许多情况下，说和做是两回事，会说不见得会做，会做不见得会说。比如说足球教练员，能教球员怎么踢球，但并一定他上场就踢得好。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这个对话肯定发生在孔子当官之前。孔子一直是很想从政的，但一直没有机会。或者是诸侯大夫没看上他，或者是他觉得与当政者不投缘。于是就搪塞道：「《尚书》上说，‘孝就是孝敬父母，友则施于兄弟。施行孝和友就是政事’。这就是为政，又要怎样才能算是为政呢？」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这里，孔子明显偷换概念，将狭义的政治换成了广义的政治。但现代政治理论确实也认为，广义的政治就是处理一切人与人的关系，特别是权力关系，谁控制谁？谁听从谁？如何做出决策等。例如现在人们所说的「办公室政治」，就属于广义政治。极端的情况，家庭内部也存在政治，特别是过去男人可以纳妾的旧式家庭。宫斗剧就可以看成是家庭政治的演绎。大的家族内部政治关系更复杂，如《红楼梦》。但狭义的政治仅指公共领域内的权力关系，特指政府或政权的权力关系与运用。问者是问为何孔子不去为诸侯为国家办事，而孔子却用更一般性政治含义来敷衍。说我管教学生、孝敬父母，友爱兄弟，使唤妻子仆人，善待乡里，这些也是为政。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;再者，儒家本来就不分私域和公域，将家事等同于国事。家庭内部关系与国家内部关系等同，「君君臣臣，父父子子」，所谓「家国同构」。国家国家，国即是家，家即是国。因之，家事和国事之间也没有明确的分野，「齐家治国平天下」，于儒家而言，是顺理成章的逻辑延伸。「齐家」则能「治国」，「治国」则能「平天下」。反过来说，「齐家」是为「治国」打基础，「治国」是为「平天下」打基础。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;所以，孔子这么回答，虽然不实诚，但理由还是很充足的。&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>澳门疗愈空间（一）：以香朝心，心可治？｜投稿 #30</title>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;作者：疯狂的澳女&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;如今这世界，是非对错、真假虚实愈发难辨。尤其迈入新工业革命，真真假假的虚实世界又流露了多少真情。我总在想，人到底有何求？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;写完两篇&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://matters.town/@macaology16/373790&quot;&gt;死亡空间系列&lt;/a&gt;，我的脑海里不断出现我所遇见心正在受苦的人。我不停思索除了「被医治」的苦，难道我们无法寻求一种舒适的疗愈方式吗？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因此，是次我想跟大家谈如何用芳疗自我疗愈。相信大家都明白，精神病在传统观念中是一种禁忌。正如呀马所说，去精神科治疗是极其需要勇气及支持。如是，我们有第二条路可选吗？或许今天我们所谈的香薰治疗会是其中一种。而认识这一种治疗方式源自笔者的一次偶遇。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;第一次遇见 Anna 时，她正耐心为客人讲解香味。不知为何，在门外看著她温婉面孔的我，那一刻深深地吸引著我。当我步入门内，空气中不断有香气环绕著我。凝视著眼前的人，她好像异常有耐心（事后足足访问了她三小时）。看著店牌上写著心疗香水，大大地引起了我的好奇。原来 Anna 是一名&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;香味可以引起人的本质及其自身经历&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna 说道，香味其实就好像是人的一个记录，每一个人书写的方式、目的皆不同。有的人会追求一种已经得不到的香味而选择复制它，可能与过往有关，冀求透过香味去延续回忆。也有人会透过香味去寻找自己，从而得到一个答案。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因此，大家想要的不一定是结果而是一个过程。在香薰治疗过程中，我们会通过一问一答的方式去摸索香味，令其自身更清楚明白自己正处于人生的哪一个阶段，而香味只是一个载体去记录自己找寻想得到的信息。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;此外，有一些人会透过香味去改变自己。比如平时是比较内敛的，便希望透过香味令自己主动及开朗一点。因此，有些人用香是希望改变自身行为或者是想法及情绪，再深入的话就是改变性格。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;心疗香水治疗过程：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step1 芳疗师询问基本的身体状况&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step2 芳疗师选择香味给治疗者访香&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step3 治疗者对香味进行联想并与芳疗师交流&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step4 治疗者对所试香味评分&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;（重复以上试香，直至芳疗师停止）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step5 芳疗师针对治疗者所评分的香型进行讲解&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step6 芳疗师针对治疗者喜欢的香型进行交流并调配香水&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;在澳门做心疗香水已经 2 年，见证很多朋友仔的改变。比如有人第一次做心疗香水时所调制的香型就揭露了他正在经历的事情。但是，当他已经走出来，再一次去试香的时候就会发现，他所选择的香与最初的选择是完全不同的香味体系。因此，调配出来的香水就会成为一个很具体的载体去告诉你，原来你已经改变了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/567b9b4f-69a1-44d0-b6b7-13cc54c72e73.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image: unsplash@soymeraki&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;其实我们喜欢一种味道是会跟你当下心情或过往经历有关。此外。当你今天完成体验之后，你喜欢的味道随时随地都会再改变。所以，在治疗过程中你所选择的香味仅反映你当刻的情绪及感受，不代表永远。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;学者发现香薰对记忆有著神奇的连结功能，无论时间过了多久，只要再次遇上特定香气，便可将您带到回忆当下，并透过香薰精油内的不同化学份子改变著您的情绪。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;人除了会喜爱香味，也会对香味有偏见&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;我们可能会因为某段快乐的记忆喜爱某种香味，但是在芳疗过程中，你会发现你可能会本能地排斥某种香味，其背后原因可能是与自身负面记忆有关。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna 指出，在试香的过程中往往会引发人们并不知道的事情，或是得到某些不曾记起的事情或新信息。排斥香味其实是在提醒你，它所联系或代表的某一件事情正影响著你非常深，甚至很久远，只是你并不知道。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;其中一个主因是，有很多试香者经常以为这是一件小事，却不知道原来它一直影响著你。因此，在香水心疗过程中最重要的是认知自己。包括意识自己选择的原因、举动及背后意义。Anna 强调，在香水心疗中并不是要解决或改变任何事情，而是帮试香者把内心世界展现出来，从而认知自我。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/77f0d498-fb44-4ab8-bdf3-9335815f7062.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image: unsplash@rishabhdharmani&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna 形容，香味就好像给了你一面镜子，你照见镜里的自己。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;人性的善与恶，在香味之下却如一&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna 提到，在试香时人往往容易展现出自我的本质。因此笔者好奇一问，在见证人的本质时，会是一个怎样的感受过程，是否也会看见人的善与恶？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna 回应，作为芳疗师反而很庆幸自己有机会作为一个角色去了解每一个人，更加觉得在芳疗过程中，反而觉得人其实是一样的。人的不同只是我们塑造出来的，可能是刻意选择或者没有选择。其实人的感受、开心与不开心其实都非常相似的。因为人的心路历程是很相似的，不论人的经历有多丰富或多简单，其实我们的心都是一样的，都会因为一些很小的事情有不同的反应。人有高高低低的时候，只是大家高低的原因不同。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;特别是在调香的过程中，试香者想真实地去观照自己内心的时候，好多事已经不重要了。所以很多时候，芳疗师不太会看到人性的一面，反而大家很难得地把重心放在自己的心灵上面，更加关注自己怎么去面对物质或人性的部分，然后如何去保留初心或健康的状态。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;芳疗师的治疗局限&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;在芳疗过程，我们会遇到不同情绪状态的人。但是，芳疗师只会因应治疗者的需求作出回应。如果治疗者没有意愿说出自已的需求，芳疗师不会主动或刻意去介入。因为如果治疗者没有准备好，芳疗师多做一步也是太多，更有机会产生不好的影响。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;比如，试香者可能只是一张白纸般来体验，但你不停挖掘他内心深处的恐惧或负面情绪，而他可能未准备好去接受。如果对方是愿意说出来甚至问你应该如何解决的时候，才会进一步去深入交流。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0a1494de-768e-4f43-8ff5-afdaca026f6a.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image: unsplash@artbyhybrid&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;另一种情况是，若遇到完全未有准备的人，我们可能会中止试香。因为试香者的状态可能不适合调香，又或者即使他调完也未必会喜欢。其主要原因是试香者没有打开自己或者出现无法辨香的情况，感觉不到香味对自己的感受。若出现这种情况，芳疗的心疗功能就很有限，那芳疗师可能会转向更目的性的解决方法，比如失眠应该用哪一种香有助入睡。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;芳香疗法如何帮助抑郁症？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;许多精油都具有显著的抗抑郁特性，这可能是当今芳香疗法最有价值的领域之一。许多帮助抑郁症的精油也可以缓解压力，因为许多精油可能由于醏含量而具有平衡作用。精油具有许多特性，不仅可以针对抑郁症，还可以保持平衡和其他身体或精神问题。－International Federation of Aromatherapists&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;在笔者试香的过程中，Anna 就好像一位魔法占卜师，不断向我喷洒魔法香味。有时候她会给我一个世界，在那一个世界里，我正安静地躺在大片草地上，懒得像只海狮般在岸上晒太阳。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;此时，Anna 便会好奇一问，那一个世界是怎样的？可是，有时候她又会用魔法带我去一个奇臭无比的空间，令我感到想逃脱，并且不断观察我的表情及反应。可过份的是，这位占卜师并不会一直给你喜爱的香味，而是一直送你去你讨厌的香味世界，因为她说：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我正在寻找你痛苦的根源⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;（待续）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#文章篇数：2️⃣0️⃣7️⃣&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;👉&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot;

            <title>微故事: 虾妹的肉饼 (东加豆)</title>
            <description>&lt;h2&gt;微故事: 虾妹的肉饼 (东加豆)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;在香港某个角落，住著一对颇有雅趣的老夫妇----{鱼毛和虾妹}。{鱼毛}虽龄已｛登陆｝，仍热衷于笔走龙蛇，醉心于书法，他的字体如游龙戏凤，充满灵动之气。而{虾妹}则是一道风景线，热爱跑步与音乐，总是随著音符的步伐，在晨曦中活力穿过街巷，看著大自然的｛蛋黄｝从山坡升起，对她来说是乐事，虾妹，她并不介意自己龄已｛入伍｝。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛大鳝｝是鱼毛的友人，同样沉迷书法、陶醉于纸笔墨的世界。不过今天他们没有以笔会友，没有在纸端斗智斗勇，二人去了海旁钓鱼。可是两小时过去，成绩并不理想，鱼毛也没有一条，更不要说大鳝了，最后发现了几条鱿鱼，还好，回家有好交待！今晚，大鳝决定去鱼毛家聚餐，其妻｛石斑｝也来访。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;虾妹知道了四人饭桌非常兴奋，她又可以大显身手了。虾妹独特的厨艺是朋友圈中的美食大使，尤其她那一味撚手小菜---｛梅菜蒸肉饼！｝&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;吃过她弄｛梅菜蒸肉饼｝的朋友都忍不住赞叹连连，虾妹做出来的梅菜蒸肉饼，口感细腻，肉饼入口即化，梅菜的微酸微咸带来的层次感让人回味无穷。--- 报纸档雄伯说。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;虾妹的｛梅菜蒸肉饼｝，不仅外形诱人，而且味道更是令人惊艳。肉饼松软多汁，梅菜的鲜香和肉饼的鲜甜完美结合，让人忍不住一口接一口。--- 楼下管理员珍姐说。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;虾妹的｛梅菜蒸肉饼｝每一口都带来满满的幸福感，她的厨艺可谓登峰造极。肉饼的鲜味和梅菜的独特风味交织在一起，让人不断赞叹，仿佛在享受一场美食盛宴。---药房超仔说。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛梅菜蒸肉饼｝是虾妹家的专长，她从不会用碎肉机来制作。人手剁肉能够保持肉的结构和口感，肉粒大小不一，还能保留一些肉筋和纤维，吃起来更有韧性，还有肉粒间有空隙，更容易释放肉质的香气，使肉饼香气更浓。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一口咬下去，梅菜和肉混合而成的酱汁随即爆出来，这种味道和口感会让人爱死的！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;四𩠌一汤、白饭任装。虾妹已经准备好，有鱼、有肉、有菜。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;轮到｛梅菜蒸肉饼｝的时候，虾妹仿佛要上演一场人生大舞台，她知道｛大鳝｝和｛石班｝这对夫妻一定来录影她，就像采访记者一样。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;虾妹伸出一双手，左手一把刀、右手一把刀，然后一下就劈下去！不停地劈下劈下、剁下剁下，猪肉和梅菜在她身上成了一种爱恨交织，总之，虾妹的自律神经感非常良好。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;落镬的过程是非常考功夫的！水的份量、热的温度、时间的恰当，拿出来的｛梅菜蒸肉饼｝果然卖相一流！大家的肚子已经饿得咕咕叫。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/665ff1ff-6139-4a5e-9913-28091d5236ba.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;豆妈小菜&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，此时此刻！就是此刻！虾妹捧著那碟色香味俱全的｛梅菜蒸肉饼｝，正准备放到客厅的饭桌上。谁知，她在厨房门口不慎踩到一支毛笔，结果跌倒了，手里的梅菜肉饼随之摔落，肉饼分散在地上，东一件、西一件，地上的肉饼还有轻微的烟冒起的，热辣辣！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;地上那支毛笔是鱼毛的！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;鱼毛脸上沾满了汗水，三个人感到非常可惜，怀著失望的心情的时候，虾妹的脑袋已经动著了。她要再做梅菜蒸肉饼，有的是时间，而且明天后天也是假期。虾妹叫他们三个人自己玩，写毛笔也好，看新闻也好，她把厨房门关了。大家看见虾妹在笑，所有问题都不是问题了，迟就迟吧。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;可是，家里原来已经没有梅菜了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然后，她的脑袋又在动著，突然，虾妹想到了鱼毛今天钓鱼带回来的｛鱿鱼｝！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;对，｛鱿鱼蒸肉饼｝！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;没有人知道虾妹在厨房做什么，但廿五分钟之后，她打开厨房门，一碟热辣辣的｛鱿鱼蒸肉饼｝就诞生了！大家也急不及待站起来看，果然卖相一流，那些鱿鱼的鲜咸味溶在肉饼中，传来一阵阵香喷喷的气味。大家也竖起了一只大拇指向虾妹致敬！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/489af8c7-35e9-4653-a257-e45e7ab362c4.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;豆妈小菜&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，此时此刻！就是此刻！虾妹正准备把｛鱿鱼蒸肉饼｝&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;放到客厅的饭桌上。谁知，她在厨房门口，又一再踩到一支毛笔。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;哎！她又跌倒了，手里的｛鱿鱼蒸肉饼｝又分散在地上，东一件、西一件，热辣辣的鱿鱼蒸肉饼！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;地上，那支毛笔是大鳝的！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;虾妹说：｛你们三个人自己玩！写毛笔也好，看新闻也好｝。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;她一手就把厨房门关了，她苦笑著关门！大家看到虾妹在苦笑，苦笑都是笑！所有问题都不是问题了，迟就迟吧。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;虾妹的脑袋在动著，可是，可是鱿鱼也没有了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;没有人知道虾妹在厨房做什么。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，又过了廿五分钟，虾妹打开厨房门，小心翼翼看地上是否有第三支毛笔。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;就是此时此刻！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;虾妹捧著那碟色香味俱全的肉饼放到客厅的饭桌上。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛咸蛋蒸肉饼｝！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/cbd259c5-ad1f-48aa-911b-288737224117.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;AI 生成&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;大家！终于有得吃咯！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;正呀！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;备注：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛登陆｝年已六十岁或以上&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛入伍｝年已五十岁或以上&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;特别鸣谢: 豆妈肉饼图片提供!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;完!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;写作日期：2024 年 3 月 21 日&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;开始时间 : 10:52am&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;完成时间 : 15:28pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;图.文. 东加豆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我除了写微故事，还制作有声书，希望我们能互相认识。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;喜欢我的文章吗？盼得到您的支持、点赞，或分享我的文章，让我知道创作的路上有你陪伴。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E8%88%87%E9%BC%93%E5%8B%B5/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/支持与鼓励/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;关于我：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;我的故事选集&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://matters.town/@tonkabean/collections&quot;&gt;https://matters.town/@tonkabean/collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;我的 NFT 文章收集箱&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://liker.land/zh-Hant/like1cdavnkhzj8wsaeafmyqctrs9952q4hgk6tpael?tab=created&quot;&gt;https://liker.land/zh-Hant/like1cdavnkhzj8wsaeafmyqctrs9952q4hgk6tpael?tab=created&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>310｜当「娜拉」回乡，重遇「高更」</title>

Matlin) 和大衞·J.斯唐 (David J Stang) 认为，人对积极事件的记性比对消极事件的记性，而这反过来又意味着，人更可能把自己的行动和信念，建立在对现实的过度积极的感知的基础之上。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;「波丽安娜效应」和「抑郁现实主义模型」都肯定了同一个核心哲学观念，那就是，除非我们在临床上抑郁了，否则我们倾向于把现实理解得比实际情况更积极。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因此，抑郁不再（或至少不只）是一种使（行动）无效的情绪障碍，它也是一扇门，通过它，我们得以窥见「现实本身」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在 20 世纪八、九十年代，这些想法依然在很大程度上停留在临床实验心理学领域。但在新世纪，随着哲学上的悲观主义开始显得好像是面对我们艰难时代的挑战的有效方式，这些想法又开始重新出现并逐渐脱离了起初的学术语境，被应用到像政治和文学那样的多样的领域。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;举几个例子来说。人们会联系法国作家米歇尔·韦勒贝克的作品（它描述了社会和性达尔文主义的压抑现实）和克里斯汀·斯摩伍德的处女作《心智生活》（用贾·托伦迪诺的话来说，它描述了「我们想的和我们实际上做的之间的深渊」）来讨论抑郁现实主义。虽然没有直接提到抑郁现实主义，但托马斯·利戈蒂的《反人类阴谋》显然也共享抑郁现实主义假设的核心观念。利戈蒂很可能是我们时代最有影响力的恐怖作家，他笔下古怪、机械的世界源自于抑郁视角看生活的「思想的零度」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我不否认，那种认为抑郁是一种看待现实的优势视角，认为抑郁能够以更清晰、更「客观」的方式来看现实的想法，在当时——差不多就在我对哲学上的悲观主义萌生兴趣的时候——的我看来颇具吸引力。而且，在某种意义上说，我依然为之所吸引：我们有充分的理由认为，悲观主义是一种理解当下、并在智识和政治上对之做出行动的有效工具。可这些年来，我越来越相信，在这种被泛化的抑郁现实主义观念中，隐藏着可能带来危险的潜台词。换言之，抑郁现实主义也是一种意识形态建构。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我发现这点很重要：抑郁现实主义和波丽安娜效应假设都是 20 世纪 70 年代末在美国——也就是说，在新自由主义资本主义诞生的同一个时间、同一个地点——出现的。在英国，最早把新自由主义经济和「现实主义」观念关联起来的，正是玛格丽特·撒切尔。众所周知，撒切尔说，资本主义之外「别无选择」，也就是说，「现实主义」的人不会梦想另一个世界，更不会为之而斗争。文化批评家马克·费舍把这种压抑的社会变革观恰当地称作「资本主义现实主义」。费舍一辈子都在和抑郁斗争，并最终于 2017 年轻生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;当然，我的意思不是说，在研究抑郁者的现实主义的时候，阿洛伊和艾布拉姆森是在制定什么政治计划。但当时的时代精神，可能的确影响了她们的研究兴趣，或至少，她们的发现助长了二十世纪八九十年代的政治氛围。尽管如此，撒切尔自我实现的预言还是成为了现实：数十年来，抑郁一直在增长，并且已经有充分的理由表明，抑郁人数的增长，至少在一定程度上与资本主义及其后果（如气候变化）相关。这也正是马克·费舍一辈子都在论证的观点。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;把抑郁当作看待世界的「优势」视角——仿佛抑郁的人更客观——可能是危险的，因为它可能会使我们认为，我们必须接受在当下的政治和经济系统之外「别无选择」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在我们的哲学工具箱中，悲观主义可能是一个有用的工具：它有助于我们看到令人不适的真相。在气候灾难和大规模灭绝的时代，作为一种思辨实践——也就是说，想象我们的行动可能导致的最坏结果并在为时已晚之前对之做出行动——悲观主义可能是必要的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但「思考可能的世界中最坏的那个」不应妨碍我们「为未来想象一个更好的世界」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;它不应成为阻止社会变革的手段。&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Posle 编辑部&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 年 6 月 26 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;马城，译、日土兀，校&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/3d1d0852-74c4-422d-a228-b949062b4cc6.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2023 年)6 月 23 日至 24 日的事件已经被描述为普京政权面临的最严重的国内政治挑战。在短短的几个小时内，瓦格纳兵团几乎没有遇到抵抗就控制了俄罗斯南部的主要城市顿河畔罗斯托夫和沃罗涅日。瓦格纳兵团甚至进入莫斯科外数百公里的地方。瓦格纳领导人叶夫根尼·普里戈任宣布开始军事叛乱，公开质疑全面入侵乌克兰的必要性，要求俄罗斯军事领导层下台，并声称他的目标是「正义」。虽然这场冲突在几乎没有流血的情况下得到解决，但这似乎永远破坏了普京对政权稳定及政权内部团结所做出的的承诺。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 毫无疑问，普里戈任是一名战争罪犯，也是一个追求个人利益的机会主义者。在叛变前的几个月里，普里戈任发表了许多声明，抨击俄罗斯军事领导层试图控制由前俄罗斯囚犯和退役军官组成的瓦格纳部队。叶夫根尼·普里戈任的事业得益于普京的庇护，他在国家安全机构中有着广泛的人脉，他最清楚政府的弱点和普京的「指挥链」的脆弱性。在乌克兰的所谓「特别军事行动」中扮演关键角色的苏罗维金和阿列克谢耶夫将军公开呼吁普里戈任「清醒过来」，「和平解决问题」。军队中的大多数人对叛军保持沉默的中立。普里戈任要求会见国防部长谢尔盖·绍伊古和总参谋长瓦列里·格拉西莫夫，二人从未对正在发生的事情发表任何评论而且消失了。值得注意的是，瓦格纳散发的传单不仅要求他们辞职，还要求立即对绍伊古和格拉西莫夫进行军事法庭审判，指控的罪名包括：残酷对待士兵、军队补给不足，以及隐瞒战争进程的真相。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 6 月 24 日上午，弗拉基米尔·普京向全国发表了紧急的五分钟讲话。他称瓦格纳的叛乱是对俄罗斯军队的背叛，但没有提到任何粉碎叛乱的具体行动。普京强调了这次兵变在道德和政治层面的影响，称这是一场需要最严肃处理的背叛。他指责叛乱分子将俄罗斯推向内战和战争失败的边缘。然而，俄罗斯总统没有提到任何名字，这表明他准备并不充分，同时对形势不确定。瓦格纳武装分子的数千人纵队在不到一天的时间里穿越了广阔的领土，在距离莫斯科 200 公里的地方自愿停下来。与此同时，据推测，普京总统匆匆离开首都，在偏远的瓦尔代乡间住所录制了他的讲话。在兵变爆发仅几个小时后，地方官员和亲克里姆林宫的政客们就在社交媒体上宣誓效忠普京和宪法秩序。可以预见的是，一些政治力量与派系和普通公民没有响应总统的号召来抵抗叛徒，而是表达了他们对叛乱分子的支持。其中包括前线两边的新纳粹分子：与乌克兰武装部队并肩作战的俄罗斯志愿军（Russian Volunteer Corps）和自 2014 年以来作为俄罗斯代理人参与与乌克兰武装冲突的鲁西奇小组。普里戈任明确回应了普京的信息。他表示，总统对瓦格纳背叛的理解是「错误的」，称自己和他的士兵们是「爱国者」，他指责莫斯科官员堕落腐败、拒绝让步。为了提高民众支持率，普里戈任提出了反普京的反对派的两个标志性主张：俄罗斯各地区应该反对莫斯科侵占国家的资源，俄罗斯领导层由骗子和腐败官员组成，这些人的行为应该被公之于众，并且将这些人绳之以法。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 尽管普里戈任完全依靠武装部队，但他宣布的计划本应为政变提供广泛的合法性。顿河畔罗斯托夫的人们把瓦格纳的战士当作英雄来欢呼，这表明普里戈任的口号可以获得广泛的支持。瓦格纳兵变未遂还揭示了安全部门不愿积极干预局势。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 正如它出人意料的开始那样，普里戈任因的「正义行军」出人意料地结束了。白俄罗斯独裁者卢卡申科在瓦格纳和克里姆林宫之间斡旋达成了一项协议。根据协议条款，普里戈任将撤回他的部队，而叛乱分子将免于受惩罚。与卢卡申科的协议似乎还包括秘密条款，授予瓦格纳一定的自治权，并为与军事领导层进一步建立关系确定了框架。普京的发言人德米特里·佩斯科夫（Dmitry Peskov）后来表示，这项协议得到了「俄罗斯总统的保证」。换句话说，公众对这些非官方协议的条款和内容一无所知。尽管所有俄罗斯军队和普通公民都被要求参加兵变，抵抗叛乱分子，但这场危机是由两个战犯之间的阴谋解决的，白俄罗斯的独裁者既扮演中间人，又扮演裁判。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 虽然这些事件的后果难以预测，但已经很清楚的是，它们将永远改变了普京的政治系统。如果这次军事叛乱成功的话，这个例子将激励未来的一些尝试。俄罗斯精英阶层内部的矛盾已经从媒体蔓延到俄罗斯城市和武装部队的现实中。整个世界都目睹了，矛盾在法律框架之外，通过普京个人「保证」的妥协得到解决。在俄罗斯，法治已经让位于黑手党法典。以暴力为支持的言论比检察官办公室、甚至是总统宣布即将进行惩罚的言论更有力。普京政权引发的战争正在成为对其自身稳更明显的威胁，并将不可避免地导致其的最终崩溃。这种崩溃会以何种形式出现？俄罗斯受恐吓、被剥夺权力的民众会挺身而出吗？这些问题的答案要到日后才能见分晓。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posle（俄语&quot;之后&quot;）汇集了持有相同观点的作者：我们谴责战争，战争引发人道主义灾难，造成了巨大的破坏并屠杀乌克兰平民。同样的战争也导致了俄罗斯的镇压和审查浪潮。作为左翼，我们不能脱离大多数劳动男女陷入的巨大社会不平等和无能为力来考虑这场战争。当然，我们也不能忽视帝国主义意识形态，这种意识形态努力维持现状不变，传播军国主义言论、仇外心理和宗派主义。我们的平台旨在研究这些问题的结构，并提出解决问题的设想。Posle 欢迎并向学者、记者、活动家和目击者——任何寻求了解现在和思考未来的人开放。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;原文链接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://posle.media/language/en/prigozhins-march-what-was-it-all-about/&quot;&gt;https://posle.media/language/en/prigozhins-march-what-was-it-all-about/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;彼得·帕夫伦斯基出生于 1984 年 3 月 8 日的苏联列宁格勒，也就是后来改名为圣彼得堡的城市。他的母亲在一家精神病院当护士，父亲是一位地质研究员。用帕夫伦斯基的话说，他是一个唯唯诺诺的普通苏联公民，只是想维护自己平稳安全的生活，是既定秩序忠实地仆人，从未从苏联解体中恢复过来。并最终在 49 岁的时候被一块生肉噎死了。帕夫伦斯基说，我的父亲就是人类软弱的体现，从他那我学会了我不应该做什么。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;帕夫伦斯基很早就辍学了，混社会、干体力活，开始吸毒酗酒，但也很快醒悟并考取了圣彼得堡艺术学院学习纪念性艺术。但真正让他伟大的，是他的一系列因摧残自己身体、具有明显政治性的行动作品。&lt;strong&gt;今天会议，我们只讲一件：2015 年的《威胁》，也是他迄今在俄罗斯的最后一件作品。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;位于莫斯科卢比扬卡广场，库兹涅茨克桥大街 24 号的卢比扬卡大楼。这里是俄罗斯联邦安全局所在地。19 世纪末，这桩大楼就存在了，从苏联的克格勃，到后来的俄情局，几度改组又扩建，惹满了鲜红。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/5a667f26-0e7f-4d4e-bc57-7401b4b5dafb.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;2015 年 11 月 9 日凌晨，莫斯科的冬天，彼得·帕夫伦斯基就在此处。他提前一周联系了两位年轻的记者，33 岁的摄影记者 Nigina Beroyeva 和 28 岁的独立电视台记者 Vladimir Romensky 让他们抵达一家位于莫斯科市中心的 24 小时咖啡馆 Chocoladnitza，除了会面的时间地点，他们二人一无所知。Beroyeva 回忆道，当时他们正在咖啡厅，帕夫伦斯基晚他们 20 分钟后到，在咖啡厅坐他们对面，没有和他们讲话，也没有点餐。等待了十分钟后，帕夫伦斯基走出咖啡厅，两位记者紧随其后。跟着戴着兜帽的他走过了地下通道，来到了卢比扬卡大楼。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;此时莫斯科时间凌晨 1 点 15 分。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;记者们跟上，然后看见帕夫伦斯基对着大楼正门做着些什么，然后突然大门火起。此时记者才刚从包里拿出相机。帕夫伦斯基面朝大街，略带诡异地、平静地站在大楼前，依旧戴着兜帽，提着汽油桶。他的背后，火焰舔舐着标志性的卢比扬卡大楼的前门。帕夫伦斯基只是站着等待，没有做任何宣言或表达。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 秒后，警察赶到了现场，把 Beroyeva 摁在墙上，把 Romensky 摔倒在地并骑在他身上。警察开着一辆黑色奔驰把两位记者给带走，随后使用各种审讯技术拷问了他们整晚，甚至威胁他们参与共谋。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/16b923e9-eef9-4963-951a-4b12831a5a3c.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;几小时后，互联网上出现一段关于这次燃烧行为的解释视频。这段视频现在已经找不到了，但留下的媒体对他的记录，帕夫伦斯基自己介绍道：&lt;strong&gt;恐惧将自由的人民变成一团黏糊糊、毫无协调的躯体。 任何人头顶都悬挂着不可避免的威胁，他们被定位追踪、电话窃听，以及护照管控。军事法庭扼杀了任何自由意志的展现。但恐怖主义只能基于动物的恐惧而存在。一种原始的防御本能会迫使人们抗争，这是无条件的防御反应。为了生命，值得一搏。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;次日早晨七点，两位记者被释放。而帕夫伦斯基被指控破坏公物罪被拘留。在这件名为「威胁」的作品发生后两天，俄罗斯安全情报局把着火的大门外封了一层褶皱的金属板。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在和警察争斗中，记者 Romensky 曾试着保护相机储存卡，但弄断了，所以除了参与了一次现场，他什么材料也没留下。不过令 Beroyeva 惊喜的是，她拍的所有照片都在，照片数据显示，&lt;strong&gt;从第一张到最后一张拍摄间隔只有 17 秒。&lt;/strong&gt;随后全世界的媒体，都争相给她电话。但他们俩至今都不知道，为什么帕夫伦斯基会选择让他们俩参与现场。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/754270b3-94da-4b28-a046-2e2908a64d4c.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;2016 年 1 月 27 日，帕夫伦斯基被送进莫斯科臭名昭著的谢尔布斯基研究所（Serbsky Institute），接受可能持续至多 21 天的精神科评估，而他是苏联 91 年解体后第一位被强制送去的艺术家。他的伴侣兼同僚 Oksana Shalygina 在 1 月 29 日公布此事并称，帕夫伦斯基进入谢尔布斯基中心后被迅速隔离，即便律师也不获准进入。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f84e5aa4-5cd8-45c1-9d00-41f6a2696868.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;2016 年 2 月 16 日，作品《威胁》被俄罗斯当代艺术创新奖提名，并在网络上的专家投票中拿到最高票，但组委会还是撤销了该作品，并没有提供任何解释或理由。也因此，8 位专家辞去组委会的工作。2 月 22 日乌克兰知名激进女权组织 FEMEN 在哥德堡艺术厅中央入口复刻了帕夫伦斯基的行动，并在网站发布**Free Pavlensky!**声明：「&lt;strong&gt;我们需要为捍衞人权而发声的艺术家。自由的艺术是无法被收买或驯服的。僵化的艺术机构需要温顺服从的艺术家，而不是那些坚定的质疑和行动。镇压当局希望艺术家熄灭火焰，好让他们焚毁自治。&lt;/strong&gt;」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/249723a5-8890-4ca1-8d0c-8d16a66555b9.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;2016 年 5 月 25 日，帕夫伦斯基还被关押期间，他获得了瓦茨拉夫·哈维尔人权奖，一个在欧洲表彰捍衞公民权利的年度奖项，那时候曾经十位获奖者中的七位仍在狱中。帕夫伦斯基的伴侣 Oksana 会替他去挪威奥斯陆领奖，他的获奖发言中写道，他在去法院的路上被守衞暴力殴打，膝盖断了，肋骨裂了，还有很多内伤，每口呼吸都是痛苦，在狱中六个月，每天都在见证警察的监控。但后来该奖项撤销给他的 4 万 2000 美元的奖金，认为不应授予使用暴力作为抗议手段的人，但当时帕夫伦斯基已经承诺将奖金赠予一个反抗警察腐败和不公执法的团体 Primorsky Partisans。俄罗斯商人 Yevgeny Chichvarkin 随后决定替他赠予奖金给该团体，帕夫伦斯基出狱后也将自己的哈维尔人权奖杯送给了 Yevgeny Chichvarkin。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16 年 6 月 8 日，在帕夫伦斯基被关押在监狱 7 个月后开庭，莫斯科法庭宣判帕夫伦斯基犯有破坏公物罪，罚款近 50 万卢布，但他拒绝支付，并要求自己被以更严重的恐怖主义罪名宣判，但未果。虽卢比扬卡的大门原件在 2008 年时被替换过，燃烧的是复制品也只损坏了部分，但他最终却被改判为破坏历史遗迹罪。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;帕夫伦斯基的行动时常模糊抗议、艺术和犯罪。他的行动对俄罗斯当局的反抗是明显的，他的抗议艺术作品是俄罗斯为数不多的异见人士的表达方式之一，他指出：「我们不需要做粉饰工作的艺术家。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而真正的争议主要在于如何辨析它是艺术，以及以艺术之名而犯罪的边界。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;莫斯科艺术批评人 Marat Guelman 认为，帕夫伦斯基这件作品具有显著的符号性，卢比扬卡大门是地狱之门，是世界之恶的入口，而帕夫伦斯基站在安全局火焰中的人影，对当今的俄罗斯来说具有重要的符号价值，无论是政治的还是艺术的。俄罗斯艺术新闻报记者 Maria Semendyaeva 认为，从艺术批评角度看，帕夫伦斯基创造了一幅从未有过的画像，他利用自己的身体和媒体作为传递这种画像的手段，当我们观看它时，会激发很多人表达的欲望。他的伴侣 Oksana 说，这是一次从陈腐的官僚体系中有趣的延展，这里面每个人都是病态的，从人到家具到话语到官僚垃圾语汇，我们稀释它们并赋予新的价值。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;帕夫伦斯基对自己的艺术主张其实非常明确，虽然被认为是第三波俄罗斯行动主义或政治艺术的代表人物，但&lt;strong&gt;他认为要抛弃这些术语，而灌之以主客体艺术事件之名。在他的行动表演里，他让抽象的权力机制变得可见。如果权力要表现得具有攻击性，那就必然会落入他安排的剧情、事件中去。而通常这些事件都和犯罪相关，权力体系被卷入到犯罪纠纷，表演交互就发生在管理者，即权力的主体，和被管理者，即权力的客体之间。在这个过程中，艺术显现，并同时，权力的主体成为了艺术的客体，使之发生的，就是权力本身。&lt;/strong&gt;而另一方面，为了反抗被强加的思想，让我们的生活解放，首先需要撕破眼前的布景，直视我们自己沦为其人质的现实。街道、广场这样的公共区域成为了画布，观众席和舞台融合，观众在无意识之间参与到了行动演出中。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b7d1fc8c-c2c0-4b78-a6b3-8fe022d2067a.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;帕夫伦斯基也区分了对事件现场的记录和艺术档案的区别，后者是美学意义上的图片、文字有意安排好的创作，并被艺术家和艺术展览在一系列判断过程里选择、展出、发表、出版，而事件现场的照片无需他本人提前安排设计好。这可能也是为什么他没有过多和两位记者事先交流，只是专注在事件发生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;对于艺术同行和媒体记者来说，帕夫伦斯基的这件作品无疑是先锋的艺术。它的视觉呈现相当清晰：&lt;strong&gt;正面曝光、黑暗图像、燃烧画框，在熟悉的图景中开辟出一个新区域，如海德格尔所言，画面中的一个「断裂」，世界中央的裂隙。这甚至不仅仅是一个画框，而更像是艺术本身的图像，现代艺术作为火焰，燃烧的画作，以及艺术家在现代艺术本质背景下的自画像。艺术家拿着汽油罐，既是纵火者又是创造者…… 如果说马列维奇的黑方块是绘画的绝对化，那么这个作品则是对现代艺术本质的象征性表达……在帕夫连斯基的作品中所有发生的一切都可以称为「艺术家在现代艺术背景下的自画像」。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/3f097249-ec7d-44d4-a0e5-b76a078a1f41.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;但站在艺术对立视角的也大有人在，一位人权运动人士 L. Alekseeva 批评道，如果这是一场表演，那就是一场愚蠢的表演，如果当时有人在里面，逃不出来，被烧伤，会发生什么？他应该去看病，任何一个正常人都不会做这样的表演。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;的确，如同他所说的，帕夫伦斯基时常被指控精神问题，如同对梵高的天才和精神问题的左右为难一样，鉴定帕夫伦斯基的精神状态和专业创作行为之间的区别也使精神分析师踟蹰。虽然精神病医生多次诊断帕夫伦斯基精神正常，完全清楚自己的行为会导致肉身和社会危险，但案件调查官依旧拒绝承认帕夫伦斯基的行为是当代艺术主张，法庭上他向帕夫伦斯基说：我不反对艺术，但你必须区分艺术和犯罪行为。帕夫伦斯基回应说：事实上，艺术是没有界限的，所谓非法行为只不过是他们用来限制艺术表达的幌子。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;话虽如此，但其实帕夫伦斯基所有作品除了他自己，谁也不会受伤，比如《威胁》作品里，他选择了夜深人静的凌晨执行，带的汽油也并不多。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ba85cb24-e7a9-4e85-b1e7-5fe094562017.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;在今天这个时代，所谓人人都是艺术家的时代，艺术被拉下神坛。重要的可能不再是艺术的审美价值，艺术超越庸常生活的价值，而是艺术家重新使其产生社会功效，不惜代价地刺穿虚伪的面皮。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一位和他有过交流的艺术家写道：「艺术发生在语词匹配行为之时，发生在你对自己的注意力掌控之时，即便当你难以微笑，你的肋骨断裂，艺术依旧发生。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;好，今天的会议到此为止。如果你觉得这次会议让你又学习到了新的思想，请把会议内容发送给更多人，或去会员区资助我们的会议，让我们可以一直把会开下去。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/e7e6ec92-0acf-4da9-966c-1acf8faf9a04.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;【另】我是个独立创作者，除了视频博主外，我也从事艺术创作，过去十年以影像、行为、表演、文本、社会实践等方式创作。因题材原因，此类项目难以获取商业价值，也不想被算法和系统笼罩，故在粉丝平台设立账号，希望获得你的支持。希望也借此证明，创作者可以独立自由创作。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;爱发电：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://afdian.net/a/actioninaction&quot;&gt;https://afdian.net/a/actioninaction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;Patreon：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/actioninaction&quot;&gt;https://www.patreon.com/actioninaction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;Recently, in March 2024, Cuba witnessed large-scale protests due to rising prices, economic downturn, and hardships in people&#39;s livelihoods. Similar protests had occurred in Cuba in 2021 as well. At that time,&amp;nbsp; I had written a commentary on the protests. I am posting this article again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting on July 11, 2021, Cuba witnessed large-scale protest demonstrations, with thousands of Cubans taking to the streets of the capital, Havana, and major cities, chanting slogans like &quot;freedom&quot; and singing revolutionary songs, leading to intense clashes with law enforcement that have yet to fully subside. This marked a highly unusual occurrence of mass political protest activities in Cuba since the Communist Party took power in 1959. Cuba is one of the few remaining Leninist-style socialist one-party authoritarian states in the world, strategically located near the United States, garnering significant international attention to its protests. People are curious about its causes, speculating about its potential outcomes and impacts. The international community, especially countries with special ties to Cuba like the United States, closely monitors the developments of these protests, poised to respond accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cuban protests stem from the public health crisis and economic turmoil brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. After the global spread of COVID-19, many countries, especially developing ones like Cuba, faced severe challenges. Despite having a relatively robust healthcare system, Cuba struggled to contain the spread of the virus. What particularly angered the populace was the Cuban government&#39;s refusal to join the international vaccine distribution program (COVAX), opting instead to develop its own vaccines, but progress was slow, supply was inadequate, and people doubted the effectiveness of the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, COVID-19 severely impacted Cuba&#39;s fragile economy. According to Reuters, the Cuban economy contracted by 10.9% in 2020 and declined by an additional 2% in the first six months of the following year. Tourism is a vital industry for Cuba, but COVID-19 dealt a devastating blow to it, leaving many Cubans in the tourism sector without income and causing Cuba to lack sufficient foreign currency to purchase essential resources like food and fuel, further hindering the development of primary and secondary industries. Cuba plunged into an even more severe shortage of goods than usual, forcing many Cubans to queue for essential supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, COVID-19 merely acted as a catalyst; the root causes of the protests in Cuba lie in the long-standing authoritarian political system and the dilapidated planned economy model, along with the suppression of people&#39;s freedoms and resulting material scarcity and widespread poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the victory of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cuba has long practiced one-party dictatorship politically, with the Cuban Communist Party monopolizing political power and banning the existence of political opposition forces. Basic elements of democratic politics, such as multiparty elections, freedom of association and assembly, and the right to protest, are entirely absent in Cuba. Economically, Cuba has long adhered to a planned economy and a state-owned economic system, leading to low productivity and a lack of economic vitality among the people. Although Cuba&#39;s political and economic system has achieved some successes, such as a comprehensive social security and public service system including free education, healthcare, and housing (with quality not as poor as that in North Korea or pre-reform China, and resource allocation relatively fair), as well as a significantly better security environment compared to other Latin American countries, the overall drawbacks outweigh the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the collapse of the Soviet bloc in the 1990s, Cuba began gradual reforms, taking bigger steps into the 21st century. Following the 2011 Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba, then-General Secretary Raúl Castro implemented measures such as economic marketization, attracting foreign investment, loosening political and ideological control, legal reforms, and improving relations with the United States. Under these measures, the Cuban economy showed some improvement, with a certain increase in national income, and the external environment for Cuba also improved. In 2016, US-Cuba relations began to normalize, with President Obama making a historic visit to Cuba. The future of Cuba seemed bright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after Donald Trump took office in 2016, he reversed almost all of Obama&#39;s policies and agreements regarding US-Cuba relations and reinstated sanctions against Cuba. This was a heavy blow to Cuba, leading to worsened diplomatic relations, severe economic damage, and setbacks for reformist factions within the party, resulting in the rise of conservative forces. Cuba once again became more closed-off, at least halting its progress toward greater openness. Its refusal to join the international vaccine distribution led by Western countries reflects its isolationist stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the sudden deterioration of the external environment following Trump&#39;s presidency, the stagnation of Cuban reforms naturally has internal causes as well. Compared to countries like China and Vietnam, Cuba has been much less open, especially in terms of marketization. Cuba&#39;s economy is backward, but its social security system is relatively robust, leading to a lack of strong willingness for change from top to bottom. While Cuba&#39;s political dictatorship is not harsh, it is closed and conservative. Under this &quot;mild dictatorship,&quot; social contradictions are not severe, making it easy for both the regime and the people to be content with the status quo, lacking the courage to make drastic changes. Consequently, Cuba&#39;s reform efforts have been sporadic, with no clear results over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak of the current protests was stimulated by the pandemic-induced socioeconomic crisis, which fueled the growth of opposition forces. When people&#39;s health and basic needs were threatened by the epidemic, they finally stopped tolerating and accommodating, leading to this late protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing the protests, Cuban authorities have employed both soft and hard tactics. On one hand, Cuba&#39;s top leader, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, acknowledged the need for government improvement and implemented measures such as lifting import restrictions to address shortages and increasing wages. On the other hand, military and police forces were deployed to forcefully disperse demonstrations, arrest protesters, detain activists, and temporarily cut off the internet. Officially, the economic and public health crises were blamed on the United States&#39; blockade and sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protests in Cuba triggered strong reactions from the United States, which has a complicated relationship with the island nation. The Biden administration expressed support for the Cuban protesters, but unlike the Trump administration, which sought to dismantle Communist rule, Biden and his left-leaning government are not actively seeking to overthrow the Cuban government. Meanwhile, Cuban exile groups in the United States strongly support and assist the protests in Cuba, calling for international attention to stop the repression of protesters by the Cuban government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation in Cuba also involves the fierce ideological divide across Latin America. The Communist Party of Cuba positions itself as a model for left-wing revolution and leftist regimes in Latin America and supports other leftist forces in the region. Consequently, left-wing governments in Latin America tend to support the Cuban government. Conversely, right-wing forces view the Cuban government as a foe and actively support anti-government movements. Following the outbreak of protests in Cuba, left-leaning governments like Venezuela and Nicaragua unsurprisingly supported the Cuban government, while right-leaning governments like Brazil, Uruguay, and Ecuador sided with the protesters. Some left-wing leaders, such as Mexican President Obrador, expressed sympathy for the protesters while opposing foreign intervention in Cuba&#39;s internal affairs. It is worth noting that while most left-wing forces in Latin America do not endorse Cuba&#39;s authoritarian model, they support Cuba out of shared socialist sentiments, anti-American and anti-imperialist principles, and practical necessity. Similarly, right-wing forces in Latin America supporting democratic protests often have tangled connections with previous authoritarian right-wing military regimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protests in Cuba are unlikely to lead to the collapse of the Communist regime. However, they mark the beginning of a new chapter in Cuban history. Opposition forces within Cuba have organized and grown in scale, and dissenting voices have transitioned from the private sphere to public spaces. The Cuban government must acknowledge the increasingly assertive and rebellious spirit of the populace and can no longer afford to postpone meaningful reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>旧文再发：2021 年古巴抗议：疫情下民生危机和专制积弊的共同产物</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;近日（2024 年 3 月），因物价上涨、经济萧条、民生困苦，古巴发大规模抗议活动。而在 2021 年，古巴已发生过类似抗议。笔者当时曾撰文评论。在此再发一次。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2021 年 7 月 11 日起，古巴发生大规模抗议示威，成千上万的古巴人走上首都哈瓦那和各主要城市街头，并呼喊「自由」等口号和歌唱革命歌曲，与警方发生激烈冲突，至今未有平息。这是自 1959 年古巴共产党执政以来，在古巴极为罕见的大规模民众政治性抗议活动。古巴是世界上现存寥寥无几的列宁式社会主义一党专政国家之一，又紧靠美国，战略地位极为重要。因此，古巴的抗议得到了世界的关注。人们好奇的探究它的起因，猜测其可能的走向及产生的影响。美国在内的国际社会尤其与古巴有着特殊关联的国家更是时刻注意着古巴这次抗议的动向，以做出相应的反应。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;本次古巴抗议，肇因于新冠流行造成的古巴公共衞生危机和经济危机。新冠在全球流行后，许多国家都陷入严重的困境，发展中国家尤其如此，古巴也不例外。虽然古巴有着世界上较好的医疗衞生体系，但仍然无力抵抗新冠的肆虐。最令民众不满的，是古巴政府拒绝加入国际疫苗分配计划（COVAX），而是由本国自行研发疫苗，但研发进度缓慢、供给不足，人们对疫苗有效性也表示怀疑。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而新冠同样也冲击着脆弱的古巴经济。据路透社报道，2020 年古巴经济收缩了 10.9%，今年前六个月又在此基础上下降 2%。旅游业是古巴的支柱产业，而新冠对旅游业造成了毁灭性的打击，不仅让大批从事旅游业的古巴人丧失收入来源，还导致古巴没有足够的外汇购买粮食、燃油等重要资源，进而又影响了第一第二产业的发展。古巴陷入比平常更严重的物资短缺状况中，许多古巴民众只能排队购买生活必需品。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而新冠疫情只是一个导火索，古巴爆发抗议的根源是长期以来古巴实行的专制政治制度以及凋敝的计划经济模式，以及这种制度和模式对人民自由的压制、导致的物质匮乏和普遍贫穷。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;自 1959 年古巴革命胜利后，政治上长期实行一党专制，古巴共产党垄断了政治权力，禁绝了政治反对力量的存在。民主政治的基本要素，如多元竞争的普选、组党和结社自由、游行示威的自由等，古巴都是完全没有的。而经济上则长期实行计划经济和公有制经济，导致人民生产积极性低落，经济活力低下。虽然古巴的这种政治经济制度也取得了一定成果，如完全免费的教育、医疗、住房等完善的社会保障和公共服务体系（而且质量并不算差，起码比朝鲜及改革开放前中国的同类福利在质量上好多了，相关资源分配也更公平均等），以及相较于拉美其他国家好的多的治安环境，但整体仍然弊大于利。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1990 年代苏东剧变后，古巴开始逐渐进行改革，到 21 世纪迈出更大步伐。如 2011 年的古共六大后，时任古共总书记的劳尔·卡斯特罗实行了经济市场化改革和吸引外资、放松政治和意识形态控制、法治改革、改善对美关系等措施。在这些措施之下，古巴经济有了一些起色，国民收入有了一定提高，古巴的外部环境也得到改善。2016 年，美古关系走向正常化，奥巴马对古巴进行了历史性访问。古巴的前景似乎一片光明。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，2016 年特朗普上台之后，废除了奥巴马时期关于美古关系的几乎所有政策和协定，重新恢复对古巴的制裁。这对古巴是沉重的打击，不仅导致外交处境恶化、经济严重受损，还打击了党内改革派，导致保守派得势。古巴再次趋于封闭，至少停止了进行更大程度开放的步伐。这次古巴拒绝加入西方国家主导的国际疫苗分配，就体现了对外闭锁的一面。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;除了特朗普上台后外部环境的陡然恶化，古巴改革的停滞自然还有内因。相对于中国和越南等国，古巴的开放程度本来就要小的多，尤其经济方面市场化程度很有限。古巴经济落后但社会保障程度不低，导致从上到下没有特别强烈的变革意愿。古巴的政治专制虽然并不严酷，但是同时也很封闭和因循。这种「温和的专制」下社会矛盾不剧烈，反而容易令政权和民众安于现状，缺乏破釜沉舟的勇气。于是古巴的改革走走停停，长期没有个鲜明的结果。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而本次抗议的爆发，是新冠疫情导致的民生危机刺激了反对势力的滋长。当疫病下健康和基本衣食住行供给受到威胁，人民终于不再忍耐和迁就，发生了这场迟来的抗议。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;面对抗议，古巴执政者软硬兼施。一方面，古巴最高领导人即古共第一书记卡内尔承认政府需要改进，采取了如取消商品进口限制弥补物资短缺、提高工资待遇等措施；另一方面，派遣军警使用暴力手段驱散示威、抓捕示威者，逮捕社会活动人士，并且一度切断了互联网。官方还将经济和公共衞生危机归咎于美国的封锁和制裁。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;古巴的抗议在与其恩怨纠葛紧密的美国引发剧烈反应。美国拜登政府表达了对古巴示威民众的支持，但不像之前处心积虑想摧毁古共统治的特朗普政权，作为民主党人的拜登及其左倾的政府无意趁机推翻古共政权。而流亡美国的古巴人团体则强烈支持和协助古国内的抗议，呼吁国际社会关注和阻止古共对示威民众的镇压。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;古巴局势还牵连着左右之争激烈的整个拉丁美洲。古共自诩拉美左翼革命和左翼政权的模范，大力支持拉美其他左翼势力。因此拉美诸国左翼力量也投桃报李支持古共政权。而右翼力量则对古共视若寇仇，积极支持古反政府势力。本次古巴抗议爆发后，不出意料的，如委内瑞拉、尼加拉瓜等左翼执政的国家选择支持古共，巴西、乌拉圭、厄瓜多尔等右翼执政的国家则站在示威者一边。还有的左翼领导人如墨西哥总统奥夫拉多尔，则在同情示威者同时，表达了反对外国干涉古巴内政的态度。当然，值得说明的是，拉美大多数左翼力量并不赞同古巴的专制主义模式，而是出于倾向社会主义的共同情感、反美反帝的道义和现实需要支持古巴。而支持民主示威的拉美各右翼势力，也不乏与以前专制的右翼军人政权有千丝万缕的联系。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;古巴这次抗议应不会导致古共政权垮台。但是它开启了古巴历史新的一页。古巴国内的反对力量已经组织化规模化，并且反抗的声音由私人领域走向公共场合。古共也必须正视越来越有权利意识和反抗精神的民众，不再推迟改革得过且过。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;（本文已发表于《上报》，封面图片取自 BBC）&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>论语漫读（36）：使民敬，忠以劝 — 让老百姓既畏惧又爱戴</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.red-publish.com/book/2990&quot;&gt;电子书：《论语漫读》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;季康子问：「使民敬，忠以劝，如之何？」子曰：「临之以庄则敬，孝慈则忠，举善而教不能则劝」&lt;/strong&gt;（为政第二）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/fdb1a7a5-d2f0-41c9-85d0-85574b09fdb6.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;季康子是鲁国的贵族，鲁哀公当政时，实际掌握鲁国大权，把国君给架空了。子是他的爵位，贵族有公、侯、伯、子和男五等爵位，子是第四等。康是他的谥号。康的含义很广，谥法中康的注解有二十余条，&lt;strong&gt;「渊源流通曰康；温柔好乐曰康；安乐抚民曰康；合民安乐曰康」&lt;/strong&gt;等等，意思都很好。看来这人有些能耐，鲁国人对他的评价不低。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;他就问孔子，「要使老百姓敬重自己，忠于自己而且还肯干活，怎么办？」孔子回答到：「在老百姓面前显得很庄严，他们就会尊敬你；提倡孝顺父母慈爱子女，百姓就会忠于你；重用善干活的人，教导能力差的人，百姓就会自我勉励，加倍努力了。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;此问当发生在孔子结束流亡回到鲁国后，这时他当政后才可能与孔子相见。季康子起用了孔子的弟子冉求，子路等，委以重任。可能看孔子年纪太大了，七十左右的人了，没有任用孔子。按现在的高级干部退休年龄规定，也应该退休了。但他很重视孔子的意见，相当于请孔子当顾问，可能还给予较高的地位和待遇。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;「以」，而的意思。「劝」，自我勉励，自我激励。季康子是贵族，孔子这里就不用像回答哀公那样「对曰」了。「举善」的「善」，我看到的注解都解释为「善良」。但联系到自我勉励肯干活，理解为善于和熟练做某事更合理些。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;与鲁哀公问的「何为则民服」相比，季康子关心的问题则是得到老百姓的敬重，忠心和卖力。他权势很大，不怎么担心老百姓不服从。而他不止想得到老百姓的服从，还想得到老百姓的敬重，忠心和卖力，希望老百姓态度上要恭敬，内心要忠诚，干活要积极。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;针对季康子的问题，孔子的办法是，要想得到老百姓的敬重，就得要严肃，要有架子有排场有威风，要与老百姓保持距离，保持神秘，让老百姓仰望。如果与老百姓太亲密太随和，就得不到老百姓的敬重。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而想得到老百姓发自内心的忠诚，就得提倡子孝父慈。自己孝顺父母，慈爱子女，臣下和百姓就会跟着效仿。季康子父亲不再了，可能母亲还在。百姓如能将孝移情到统治者身上，视统治者为父母，就能得到老百姓的忠心了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而重用奖励能干的，教导技能差的，这也是现代管理的重要激励手段。孔子早在两千多年前就知道应用，还是很了不起。他可能是从驯导牲畜中体会出来的。牲畜干活好，就给奖励，干得不好，就接着教或者给予惩罚。当然，惩罚是法家重要手段，但儒家也不排斥。儒家的统治手段以道德感化为主，以刑罚为辅。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;孔子特别重视统治者要庄重。在另外场合也强调过。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子曰：「知及之，仁不能守之，虽得之，必失之。知及之，仁能守之，不庄以莅之，则民不敬。知及之，仁能守之，庄以莅之，动之不以礼，未善也」&lt;/strong&gt;（衞灵公第十五）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这段话显然是讲统治者应当如何治理国家。孔子说，「统治邦国，才智够了，但仁德不够守住。虽然得到了君位，也必然会失去」。仁德不够，臣属和老百姓的支持度低，长此以往，必然会下台。「才智和仁德都够了，但在臣民面前不庄重，那就得不到臣民的敬重」。孔子不赞同「齐之以刑」，靠恐惧来让臣民服从，但还是想让臣民对统治者有一丝丝畏惧之心，所以统治者必须在臣民面前显得威严和崇高。「才智、仁德和庄重都够了，但不以礼节差遣臣子，也不够尽善尽美。」君主一般不会直接差遣老百姓。孔子主张&lt;strong&gt;「君使臣以礼」&lt;/strong&gt;（八佾第三），就是在言语和态度上要尊重臣下，不要随意喝骂，支使来支使去。但按他这句话的意思，「不以礼」也基本合格了，只是不完美而已。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;马基雅维利在他的《君主论》中认为，臣民对君主的感情分为爱戴、畏惧、憎恨三类。君主应当避免受臣民憎恨，然后在爱戴与畏惧之间寻求平衡，而让畏惧多于爱戴是最佳状态。如果非要在两者之间选择，那宁肯让臣民畏惧。孔子则主张统治者优先得到臣民的忠心和爱戴，其次再让臣民敬服。两人对爱戴和畏惧的重要性认识不同。季康子将「敬」放在「忠」的前面，说明他更希望让臣民畏惧他。&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>309｜关怀汇流 | 转身，是彼此托起的关怀之力</title>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;新的一年，行动可以柔软也坚韧地发生，愿你照料好身心和彼此。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;「关怀汇流」计划萌芽于 2023 年伦敦设计双年展的 CARE 主题馆 (Care

care）都是一种控制的话，那我们去关心彼此的空间到底在哪里？或者说，难道我们只能依靠个体之间的那一种支持，或是家庭当中的支持？所以，在这种探索脉络下，我进入到了社区学习与发展的领域。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;当时在全球范围内，以弗莱雷为代表的批判教育学广为流传，这些内容对当时的一些社区工作者产生了非常大的影响。他们发现除了去做一些很基本的文教活动之外，还可以去做一些比较「彻底」的一些事情，例如带大家一起去做自我教育、公众教育，指向共同的目标，一起去行动。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;由此，激进的议程不断凸显。但是在这个过程中，我们会看到很多问题。比如上野千鹤子在书里举到一个例子：日本早期的学生运动号称打倒天皇，内部的女性却在被或显性、或隐性地压迫。女权主义当中的一些思考给到了我很多启发。但当时直接影响到我的是解放心理学。解放心理学产生于全球战争动荡的时期。在那时，人们发现——&lt;strong&gt;如果我们没有解决招致我们精神健康的一些社会问题，那么我们永远不可能真正的达成所谓的疗愈。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;西方的个体心理学决定了他在面对社会问题时会倾向于考虑个体，即被压迫者。而我们应该去看到个体之上的社会层面，一并考虑个体与社会的痛苦，最终落脚点在于创伤本身——创伤必定来自伤害，伤害则源自外界环境，环境中便包含了压迫者或施暴者。这时，创伤就成为我理解个体心理，困扰我们内心的创痛和社会议题之间的切面。当我们个体和社会产生交叉并造成伤害的时候，创伤就出现了。在这个视角下，创伤成为了社会后果。&lt;strong&gt;因此，我们真正地去处理创伤就意味着我们要去关怀社会，以及我们在关怀社会问题时，也要考虑到个体的创伤。&lt;/strong&gt;怎样避免二元对立？这需要很多的摸索，我想跟大家分享我的其中一项思考——关于创伤和内在压迫的话题。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;波瓦（Augusto Boal）是巴西重要的戏剧家，他受到解放神学和当时整体社会环境的影响，提出了一套戏剧方法，号召被压迫者抗争。他的剧场实践在早期倾向于政治宣传，而后在被压迫者教育学和实践经历的影响下转向了更为民主、参与的方法，并将其称之为「被压迫者剧场」。当波瓦的工作得到国际上的认可后，他试图在其他的国家推广被压迫者剧场，希望也能给大家带来解放。当他在巴西的时候，巴西的军政府里存在明确的反派——警察，然而在法国，他却找不到非常明确的压迫者——但人们确实感到抑郁、焦虑、无力乃至绝望。这时，压迫更像是一个整体的社会氛围，变成一种规训，它内化成我们内心的一部分了，所以波瓦将其称之为「头脑内的警察」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;进一步，我想说明我们是如何在心理和剧场的领域工作的。咨询常常会把一些东西外化出来，有时我们也会带一些戏谑的成分将对方的话重复，来帮助他们把抽象的心理具体化。在咨询或是一些剧场形式中，会有治疗师或其他参与者替你将内心扮演出来。例如，参与者们会扮演「主角」心中无数压迫的声音。不过，这时「主角」其实很难直接站出来去反驳这些声音，于是，治疗师或其他参与者就会站出来，去见证事件的发生，去反驳这些声音，去连接个体与社会结构。这个连接意味着将批评的声音标识为一个外部进来的东西，并进一步分析内心声音的来源——来自父母？来自家乡？还是来自某个团体？特别是当参与者发现大家都拥有同样的经历，那我们会发现，&lt;strong&gt;我们不仅仅面对的是原生家庭或是人际关系上的问题，而是社会的症结，是我们社会浸透内心的声音。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这是我非常想分享的一个切入点，它只是其中的连接点之一。还有很多连接的可能需要我们去探索，从个体或者一个治疗性的环境里，演变为与团体和社群共同工作的方法。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;02.&amp;nbsp;殷艾雯&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「疗愈社会」在疗愈什么？&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;我是一个设计教育者，我所教学的专业叫做在地设计。「在地设计」是一种特殊的设计方法和理念，强调设计师应当将自己置身于情境（situation）之中，认为自己是情境、局势中的一员，以个体肉身去感受现实，而非以一种局外人的姿态去纵观全局，从而得出一种离地的设计方案。在教学实践当中，我经常向学生强调个体感受、个体故事在在地设计中的重要性。在我看来，只有设计师从自身做起，认为（自身的）生命经验是值得珍惜，值得理解的，并且坚信这样真诚的生命经验必然能够与更广泛的群体和更广阔的世界产生共鸣，这位设计师才真正拥有在地设计的基础。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在教学的过程中，时常会有学生误会我们只是在贪求学生的个人故事，甚至认为我们教的不是设计。但实际上我们是鼓励&lt;strong&gt;个体先充分感受身在其中的痛楚与不适——我们今天把它叫做「私愤」——在充分接纳自身的私愤以后，利用自身私愤的动能去联结更多的人，从而看到私愤当中的公愤成分——即社会中存在的结构性问题和不公正&lt;/strong&gt;——最后我们希望学生可以学会超越自身的私愤，去完成公愤中应有的义务和责任。从而实现对个体和社会的疗愈和改变。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;私愤和公愤之间的差异在于，私愤通常是个体成长过程中未解决的创伤所导致的，而公愤则涉及更广泛的结构性问题。然而，私愤和公愤并不是完全对立的，它们通常同时存在于个体之中。在实践中，很多人往往难以正视自己的私愤和内在创伤，尤其在面对社会公义问题时。有些行动者会产生过度反应，这往往是因为他们个人的创伤被触发。然而，他们往往不愿意正视自己的私愤，并将所有的愤怒归结为结构性问题，这样的有意无意地用公愤包裹私愤的做法，往往会在表达公愤诉求的行动中将问题的进一步复杂化。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我们在荷兰举办过一期让人印象深刻的「浮萍定海」。那一场来了很多现实中的行动者，ta 们在游戏中展现出了很多行动者公愤裹挟私愤的各种形态，这映照了很多种社会行动失败的路径，比如为了公共目标完全不顾自身状况，反而导致社群不得不牺牲大量资源去挽救 ta，比如不断地提倡大家参与行动，却在人们前来参与时以各种理由拒绝，令自已永远孤身一人；比如热衷描绘蓝图却没有实际的联结行动，乃至以情绪勒索的方式来指责群众冷漠，等等。&lt;strong&gt;当我们无法分辨内心追求当中私愤与公愤的边界与缠绕时，很容易将公愤的内容工具化，为自身不可言说的需求来服务。&lt;/strong&gt;很多行动的时候我们对一些人事的失望，往往也来源于此。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;很多时候我们受伤了，往外看是容易的，但向内去看到自己私愤的内容，或看到自己貌似正义的公愤表达中其实隐含着修复个体创伤的需求，接纳整合两者是困难的。彬华之前的反思，我们可以理解为担忧心理学会通过疗愈私愤而消解公愤，这也是我们不愿意看到的。更理想的状况是大家能够辨析两者并且将两者的疗愈从一种互相排斥转换成互相滋养的关系。也就是说，能够在疗愈自己的时候也不放弃这个公愤当中应有的责任和义务。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;回到设计上来讲， 在社会设计里常常出现因为视角过高而看不到底层的真实，即容易无视个体乃至社群的日常生活以及心理动能。这种设计思路假设社会正义是应然之举，因此私愤在此没有任何容身之处。这种设计思路应用到现实当中，无论成功与否都会让人羞于面对自己的内在需求，觉得我的公愤当中竟敢有私愤。但个体的需求是不会消失的，所以造成的结果往往是要么公愤包装私愤，要么私愤消解公愤，要么公愤压抑私愤，这对个体和社会都是难以形成有效的疗愈和发展。这也是为什么我要提倡这种在地设计，不仅仅是将自己置身于现实当中，和现实中的人站在同一个视角产生联结，我们自己也要和自己的内在世界产生联结，这样我们才能以自己的具体肉身，与具体的人在一起。这样的设计者才能够和人们在一起创造一个真正的共同体。&lt;strong&gt;能够疗愈自我的设计者才能够疗愈大众。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;03.&amp;nbsp;陈怡宁&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;从身体打开别样连结与关怀&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;我前阵子去贵州做了一个和洞穴有关的活动。其中有个洞穴用于苗族洞葬，我们在两位苗族鬼师的带领下进洞。鬼师主持葬礼，为亡者开路。在乌漆墨黑的洞中行走的时候，我发现鬼师们好像并不需要光照，而且走路时几乎没有声音。他们就像洞穴的一部分，即使身处洞穴之外，仍然和洞穴存在某种联系。这让我感觉很神奇。我们或多或少也许可以从身体结构和物理规律找到些如何让脚步声变轻的方法，但这种像是融为一体的脚步声和连结到底从哪里来？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;洞穴后来用它的方式给了我一些答案。几天之后在另一个洞穴深处，领头的三哥带我们七弯八拐进入一个洞中之洞，并让我们关掉头灯。最后一盏头灯熄灭，我瞬间丢失了眼睛。突然失明让我紧张地睁大眼睛举起双手，却惊恐地发现是真的伸手不见五指，睁眼闭眼没有差别。三哥让我们静止，专注呼吸。我放松下来，周遭的一切流进我的身体，岩壁的凹凸水痕、空气的流向湿度，都以 ta 们独有的方式和我的身体共振、连结，洞穴因此勾勒出形态，而我的存在本身也以一种最为根本而纯粹的方式被感知，被确认和承托。「I am because we (/you) are.」 这种连结给予的自我确认无关任何社会身份、属性或价值，像是一个无时无刻无处不在的拥抱，蒸腾出广袤的安定感，无条件的温柔和慈悲。彼此的主体性在这样的相互关系中得到「体」认。这是一种什么感觉呢？现在，如果你方便的话可以站起来，试着去感受：不是自己站在地面上，而是地板、大地在触摸自己，周遭的空气在呼吸自己，将自己呼进呼出。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;这种对存在本身关系性的感知可以在不同情境中被召唤和习惯，然而在工具化和便利性需要不断升级的社会环境中，人与人、人与物之间的关系趋向单一，这种最为自然基本的身体感受，就像重力一样，经常被忽视，被悄悄地剥夺。&lt;/strong&gt;对存在本身关系性的领悟和觉察，我认为是在关怀实践中很重要的一环。照护和关怀需要在这样的关系性中自然落成。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;洞穴活动结束之后，我随一位朋友继续在贵州停留。某天深夜，我们去贵州县城一处「易地扶贫搬迁」住宅区。规划齐整的居民楼寂寂，走到某处，我们打算穿过草坪去楼里看看。抬脚正要跨进草坪，我感觉身后揹包的提手被向后拉了一下，转身回看，发现朋友在两米开外，背后没有钩状物也没有人。之后的几天里我感觉脚步沉重，内脏悬浮，像套上了玻璃罩子。直到上了一处海拔三千米的山脊。开阔处的风力发动机和背风处的坟冢交错出两种截然不同的人地关系。我们从一处坟冢去往另一处坟冢，走向某个折了机翼的发动机。途中，我突然脚底打滑，差点从坡上滚下来，照平常肯定是吓坏了，玄妙的是，那瞬间身心平稳，我感到什么东西落地了，连带着我的玻璃罩子也没了，我也落地了——我们共同促成了某件事情的发生。这个认知来得如此顺理成章，别无选择，也无需别的解释。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在贵州的这些奇妙经历和感受总是会让我想到接触即兴，这是一种探索身体结构、重量和重力之间关系的舞动。它强调在不断变化的动能关系中自然生发身体运动。坠落、翻滚、承重、倾倒，对关系性的觉察刻进意识之前的身体反应，呼应古老朴素的生存智慧。它同时也揭示所有看似单人的舞动都是某种共同促成的自然流动。有关照护和关怀的具身认知随之而来。坠落不再是坠落，而是来自另一片空间的承托，我翻滚你旋转我，我揹负你，而你也在拥抱我。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;在对关系性的觉察和维系中自然生发关怀和照护，就是行动本身。&lt;/strong&gt;这不是某个社会议题的附属品或创伤药膏。它需要持续不断地身体力行，成为日常。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;04.&amp;nbsp;赵伊人&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;内化淤泥的清理&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;今天的讨论让我有相互倾听和共鸣的感觉，我感觉我作为个体汇流在一个巨大的河流里面的感觉，好像自己只是一个小小的水滴，和大家融合的同时也能清晰的感受自己的边界和价值，我觉得这种场域非常珍贵。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;今天这个主题没有要用公愤包裹私愤，很多策划人通常会以一种某个议题多么重要多那么紧急，大家一定要来听，或者「再不关怀就不行了」——这种危机创造式的话语会很容易让个体或者观众进入一种「Fight, Flight or Freeze Response」（3F 反应，逃避反应），也就是要么战斗、要么逃跑或僵住的状况。我觉得乃一和书韵在开场奠定了很好的基调，也就是&lt;strong&gt;「从自己的需要出发」&lt;/strong&gt;，虽然只是轻轻的、短短的，好像很谦虚地讲了一句「策划这个活动是我们自己的需要」，但奠定了一种非常 self care 的底色。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;结合自己的实践经历，我将这个过程概括为&lt;strong&gt;「清理自己身体或者日常生活中各种外在的沼泽内化于我的淤泥」&lt;/strong&gt;——它不是你在做一个多么重要的什么革命性的东西（当然如果你重新定义革命的话也可以是），但是很重要的是你承认将清理内化淤泥作为起点；而不是那种我们在社群里也常见的外来拜访或者话语的道德谴责或者绑架：比如，你为什么不去投入更重要的 political agenda 里？你为什么不这样做，不那样做？一开始会特别容易被那种东西绑架，但只要坚定地基于自我关怀、尊重自己，你会发现和慢慢体会到行动可以是非常柔软的，就像刚才怡宁那段非常诗意的讲述那种柔软的感觉。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我所工作的基金会最近在开一个关于「积极老龄化」的新公益业务线，今天上午我们还在组读书会读老年后如何进行个人第二次成长的书，书名叫《生命的对话》。从书里我引申出的三个非常重要的点也和今天的讨论有关：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;第一，臣服于自己的身体，其中很多用到戏剧、接触即兴等方法；第二，重新发现或者重新诠释自己的记忆，就是你怎么讲述你的生命故事；第三点，感受到自己的灵魂连接着比我更大的东西。这三点是在个人成长中是非常重要的东西，这样你才能真的接纳自己，也更能同理别人，你能更能柔软地行动，也同时为社会做出一点贡献。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;05.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;张炜仑&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关怀如微小蘑菇&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;大家的分享也让我很有感触，我们在线上交流，好像围坐成一圈，这展示着不仅属于人的圈子的缠绕，而是像怡宁所说的，不同世界和不同关系之间在一起聚合。现在「多物种（multi-species）」的话题非常热，我在想，与其去纠结「不以人为中心」的概念，其实看一看我们身边的这些遭遇本身就是由不断的、不同的关系、不同的能量、不同的偶然而耦合起来的过程。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我想讲一个故事。我的性格是比较外向型的，常常会不由自主地表达自己的观点和情绪，但我的缺点是偶尔会不善于抓住别人的想法，但我身边许多要好的朋友都是内向的。我有一个非常好朋友某天在微信群里很惊喜地分享，说他的洗脸池下水道里长了几个蘑菇。我当时第一反应就是，好恶心啊，怎么长了蘑菇还这么开心呢？他就跟我说：像我们平时在外跟其他人的关系中不太善于表露自己的人，会注意到小的植物不断生长的过程，让我觉得特别疗愈。这位朋友的话让我觉得特别有意思，我也开始学着观察类似蘑菇之类的小生命，因为我想知道我这位朋友的体验是怎么样的。虽然我不能说我现在能完全理解这种体验，但我想说的是，&lt;strong&gt;关怀本身是一个学习的过程，是一个能 get 到他人的体验、是看见他人的过程。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;另外一方面，讽刺的是，我们所经历的过去这几年对于我和我身边熟悉的一些伙伴来说从多个层面上都充满了「祛魅感」，是一个对诸多话语深感破产（disenfranchised）的时期。当我得知要分享「关怀 care」这个话题的时候，我笑了，因为似乎大家这一两年说的最多的话反而是「我不 care」！我相信很多朋友也有同感——关系破裂我不 care，面临各种或公共或私人的危机我也不 care，尽管我们面对愤怒和沮丧，我只能关照好我自己，大不了去泡个澡吃吃喝喝就好了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我们遭遇着信仰的崩塌和同温层的破裂……一方面我们面临的是一个越发不稳定的社会，危机变成常态的日常生活，关系和信任不断在被表演和策略给商品化的状况当中，一方面又需要重新去思考超越不断被个体化的关切与关怀问题。我们面对的似乎不是「我们要或者不要关怀」的问题，而是「我们怎么去关怀」的问题，从一个是或不是的对立答案回到「关怀」到底意味着什么的再思考中。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在我们经历了过去危机感不稳定感达到高潮的悬置状况后，大家可能慢慢地意识到这种所谓的反思，所谓的批判的表演对于当下的我们来说愈发不具有生产性。我想到十几年前，知名社会理论家拉图尔（Bruno Latour）曾在一篇文章中拷问：批判是不是已经到了弹尽粮绝的时候？（Has Critique Run Out of Steam?）他指出，我们作为社会批评家或者希求让社会变好的思考者，能否设计出另一种更强有力的描述性工具来阐述关切，且这种工具的意义不再是揭穿真相，而是像女性主义学者唐纳·哈拉维（Donna haraway）所说的，回到保护和关心他人的本质；有没有可能在事实的描述中增加现实感，而不是减少现实感，尽管后者来自我们内心深处的批判精神和冲动？拉图尔想表达的道理其实很简单——&lt;strong&gt;我们需要停下来环绕四周，感受大地，而不是俯瞰众生。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我自己的观察和实践都集中在城市社区中。「俯瞰众生」在我的研究中其实非常常见。城市和社区的层面，每当涉及某些与基础设施或土地密切关联的资源时，「关怀」会作为一种谋取这些资源的工具被不断地提及。然而，往往这种展现方式是通过某些机构化的机制将「关怀」规模化（scaled up）——比如成立一个组织，向政府拿钱，为了关怀的名义不断向上扩张向上撑起一个符号化的闭环。还有一种「关怀」通过社群的机构化呈现，比如志同道合的青年人组成社群，往往会为了获得社会的认可去复制一系列既有的机构模式并内化到社群的架构当中，需要制定一系列象征性的规章制度来框限原本「一起玩」而产生的实践。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我觉得&lt;strong&gt;这两种是我们应该反思的关怀路径——通过规模（scaled）和机构（institutionalized）的模式来实现或满足某种关切的使命。&lt;/strong&gt;小到团体，大到国家的维度，用条框的定势思维去审视关怀本身。这种关怀成为维持某种形式性结构的符号，我们已经在日常生活中意识到相关问题，却持续反复框限于这种模式——简单来说，这种口号的「关怀」，是「我们需要去 care」，「我们为了 care，一定要找到某种解决方式」类似的迷恋，为了不断向上层力量拿钱拿资源而进行的自我营销，等等……不管是通过什么方式，这种「关怀」思路很容易再生产出另一种包袱。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;彬华和艾雯分享的设计理念和新的思路可以提供新的启发。关怀一方面可能会无形或有意地变成另外一种社会控制，但另外一方面也能在不断看似混乱的拉扯和互惠的过程当中，让这些关怀的陷阱变得可见。通过试验性的探索去不断地试错，而不是一蹴而就地搭建条条框框的形式来处理关怀。也就是说，关怀变成了一种很流动的，像怡宁所说的，能够被抓取的，柔软的实践。这也很符合女性主义的关怀态度。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;彬华和艾雯所分享的观点，突显关怀需要维护和修补（maintenance）。如果不把关怀变成一种自我剥削的工具的话，它怎么成为一种有益的劳动来实现拉扯和互惠？以上几位伙伴的讨论展现了这个面向。&lt;strong&gt;另一种关怀的面向将关怀想象成一种缠绕着的、具有关系性的力，这样的「care」既以人作为一个参照点，但又不把人作为绝对的中心，像是我前面提到的「蘑菇式」的关怀，慢慢学会看到微小的事物以及其中所潜藏的可能性。&lt;/strong&gt;这是我刚刚在大家的分享中看到的最有启发的两种关怀的风格。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;观众讨论&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;曹书韵：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;谢谢各位伙伴美妙的分享。我补充一些自己在准备这场关于「关怀」的圆桌论坛时内心的张力。最近工作非常忙，很想慢慢地、扎实地准备今天的讨论，但又感到心力还不够，我隐隐约约想着，首先应该从自我关怀做起，「知行合一」地策划这场交流。如果用一种自我耗竭的方式去「表演」一场关怀的话语，好像完全违背了初衷。我很庆幸从自身的需要出发，发出了邀请，即使是在线上都能感受到大家如此强的能量场。在策划时我有在想是否要从一个冥想开始，但又感觉自己还没有准备好，特别谢谢怡宁用一种美妙的引导带我们一起回到身体的当下。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;殷艾雯：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;怡宁的分享讲述了非常的美妙的体验！她提到先试着感受单脚站在地上那种独立难支撑的感觉，再到后面感受大地的托起，这种视角的不断转换给了我很大启发，包括后面描述如何背起一个人的情景，&lt;strong&gt;实际上并不是单纯要背起一个人，而是互相拥抱。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在前面的分享中我花了很长时间讨论公愤和私愤。在怡宁的讲述中，我突然意识到，&lt;strong&gt;公愤和私愤之间只差一个转身&lt;/strong&gt;。当你把头转向私愤时，你的身后就是公愤。这只是一个转身的问题。我觉得她提示了一个非常关键的点，那就是&lt;strong&gt;你能够拥有这个转身的可能&lt;/strong&gt;。首先，你要意识到自己的存在，意识到自己是宇宙的一部分——只有当你明白自己并不是独立的存在，也不仅是在背起他人，你才可能实现这个转身。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我有一个学生，她有非常传统的设计教育背景，在过去的两年里，她一直在做关怀系统的设计，调研了很多养老院。她一直非常困惑痛苦，无法认同自己的设计，我告诉她，「你的眼界太高太远了。如果你的关怀只停留在空中，将那些你想关怀的人视作抽象的用户，那么你真正的关怀在哪里呢？」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这两个月，她突然做出了「转身」。她说，我想和我的外婆一起设计。她之所以想做这一设计，是因为她认为她的外婆在养老院里受到了不公平的对待，她觉得外婆无法获得她所定义的「良好的老年生活」，但她一直不愿意承认这一事实。甚至有段时间，她完全不提及这个原因，因为觉得这会让她的设计失去正当性。在终于承认这个事实后，她仍然质疑，「你逼我说出这个原因了，那又怎样呢？这会让我的设计更能够为大众负责吗？不可能，我要做的是系统性的变革！」然后她「转身」了。她说，「好，我愿意接受你的批评，我去和我的外婆谈这件事情，我想要和她一起去做。」昨天在评估会上，她第一次讲述了这两个月内的所做所思，她和外婆长时间讨论，还没有做出具体的东西，突然间外婆对她说，「你知道吗？你这样和我说，让我第一次觉得我还是有用的人，我不仅仅是一个被关心的人，我可以通过你的关怀来关心这个社会。」她哭了，「做那么多设计，只有这个我觉得‘有用’。真正的有用就在身边。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我觉得这个故事有些回应到怡宁说的「我揹负你，而你也在拥抱我。」&lt;strong&gt;我们再看看关怀者与被关怀者的关系，被关怀者的存在不应为了迎合你去证明自己是那种有能力去托起别人的那个人，Ta 在被关怀的同时也在关怀你。&lt;/strong&gt;我们可以察觉到 ta 们给予我们的关怀吗？（如果可以，如果我们明白 ta 们在关怀的关系中的主动给予）我们可以把 ta 们从被动的位置中放出来吗？这只差我们自己的一个转身。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;观众 1：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;如果很多结构性问题出于地域不平等的发展，很多的行动可能只能在一线城市成立，那么地方城市呢，类似于四线城市或者县城，乡镇？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;殷艾雯：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;行动不能被视为固定的配方，而是需要根据不同的环境来进行调整。如果你在设计一项行动时，意识到它在一线城市的环境中非常有效，那么当你回到或前往四线城市、乡村或县城时，是否可以找到不同的方法来激励人们？是否可以以类似的在地关怀的方式重新设想与当地人联系的方式，并逐步建立起与大城市及周边城市的联系？这是一个更广阔的视角，也就是说，我们不应该将行动想象成一个单一的产品，用一种固定的配方在不同地方推广。实际上，关怀并没有一种适用于所有情况的配方，每个人、每段关系和每个世界都是独特的。我们能否怀着这样的关怀走进彼此的联系中呢？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;张炜仑：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我们刚才讨论的关怀是一种情境化的实践，它深深嵌入在特定的框架或语境中。然而，这并不意味着我们可以或多或少地忽视那些存在于大型结构性问题中、以不同形式呈现的压迫。因此，我们既要意识到这些大型形式上的压迫，又要环顾自身周围，无论是在县城还是一线城市，看看周围存在哪些小型关怀。这并不是采用口号式的运动方式来寻找解决方案，而是要深入这些解决方案的源头，并汲取其养分的地方往往是一些被忽视或被很少人察觉的情境。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;赵伊人：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我来读一段话，这是我写的一个关于「边界」的词条，来自我们做过的一个展览项目《辞海游戏》（书韵发起、黄奕编辑）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在与一些因政治立场和社会关怀而互动的个人和社群交往过程中，我深刻体会到个人与他人能够改变社会的殷切希望之间存在巨大的张力。曾经为了填补这种张力而牺牲了自己的兴趣和精力，但我个人感受到了极大的不适，比如被利用、被夸大其词地吹捧、被耗尽精力以及被贴上反动的标签，还有被僵化地看待和寄予过高的期望。我深刻认识到个人的渺小和社会持续糟糕的现状。后来，我慢慢学会适应这种张力，甚至偶尔「play with it」。我提醒自己不能变得悲观，也不能不顾一切，而是要仔细权衡每个值得考虑的具体交往情境。同时，我也深刻认识到&lt;strong&gt;每个人都需要被视为独特的个体，所以我只能做一些微小的事情，与少数人交往，这样才能让我作为一个人真正被看见、被理解和被尊重。这种生活实践一定有其界限，不能因为怀有普世的关怀而无法划定边界，试图惠及所有人。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;观众 2：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;感觉一些社区营造好像也是一种关怀表演的高潮，但年轻人又在动荡的社会急需寻找下值支点，于是可以有利于快速进行关怀生产的实践项目组织成了大家的首选。然而，这种快捷的路径会让人在回过神来时感到新的无力。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;殷艾雯：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一个更加成就导向的社会常常会混淆世俗的成就感和归属感，我们会认为一旦获得了被世俗价值所认可，我们就有了归属感，就能够被接纳。然而，实际上在研究的时候会发现，这是有问题的。一种所谓的「附近归属感」是如何与身边的人建立联系，如何找到自己的社群。当你感受到被具体的人托起后，再去寻找成就感，就可以逐渐剥离私愤和公愤之间微妙的边界。因为当你的私人愤怒得到具体的支持后得到一定的疗愈，当你寻找成就感时，你就会意识到自己追求的是与社会的连接，而不是一些难以言说的个人疗愈。&lt;strong&gt;在这个成就感和归属感不断相互滋养的过程中，我们作为个体获得了更广阔的成长空间&lt;/strong&gt;，我们就可以进入所谓的「广泛归属感」，即愿意无私地接纳自己是宇宙的一部分，我们可以托起地球，地球也可以托起我们。因此，社区里的年轻人非常需要这种价值观念，以便进入社群建设中的「关怀表演」。然而，我们不一定能找不到附近可以支撑我们的人，无法进入个人疗愈的状态，因此不得不通过追求成就感来寻找归属感。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我们当然可以批判社区营造在某种程度上把关怀变成了一种表演或产品，成了不断强化资本主义的过程。但是，如果我们想在其中寻找突破点，根据我们的研究，建议大家&lt;strong&gt;首先在周围建立自己的关怀网络，让自己可以被支持，同时也托起别人。&lt;/strong&gt;在这个过程中，你将不再混淆成就感和你所需要的归属感，摆脱这种不断重复生产的无力感。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;陈怡宁：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;曾经让我非常困扰的问题是，我们与批判理论和左翼思想之间的关系是怎样的。当我们了解宏大理论分析的结构性问题，以及有可能的新出路时，它们对我们来说意味着什么。很多时候，左翼行动一再陷入一个陷阱，即理论支持往往会被转化为一种新的行动纲领和蓝图，理论和理论者居于不必要的高位。如何区分信仰和信任，是我们需要在实践中需要时时关注的。也许可以把理论或者某种关怀模式当成自己身边的同伴，在具体的实践中，通过身体的体验和感受去与 ta 交流，寻找和 ta 的映射与连接，没有也不必太在意。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关于「关怀汇流」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在第四届伦敦设计双年展 (London Design Biennale) 「Remapping Collaboration」的主题框架下，CARE 主题馆 (Care Pavilion) 通过一系列全新委任项目对关怀议题展开探索：思辨关怀由人类和非人类表达和承载的多种形态，体认其中错综复杂的意涵。15 位享誉国际亦深耕在地的杰出创作者共同对这个一直存在但又愈加紧迫的议题做出回应，由此生发的实践旨在超越隔离与停滞，重新编织与彼此、与世界、与万物原本被掩盖的关系。项目以冥想、仪式、表演、出版、圆桌等形式进行，并以《Care Manifesto》汇聚全球设计师、建筑师、思想家和行动者的关怀宣言。2023 年伦敦设计双年展 CARE 主题馆由宋涛担任总策划，由王乃一担任策展人，雅娜·舒尔茨 (Jana Scholze) 担任学术顾问，李思蔚担任展览总监，并得到了信言设计大使专题资助计划 (Design Trust Feature Grant) 支持。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在伦敦设计双年展闭幕当天，&amp;nbsp;「关怀汇流」计划正式启动，希冀创造多个共同在场的时刻，通过多学科视野与个体经验的共振，重新构想关怀的政治、伦理与潜能。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;最新文章（持续更新）&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol

            <description>&lt;h2&gt;微故事: 她她时光机 (东加豆)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9db6bd0a-f0de-45b5-9049-b8aa8660e2ac.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;在香港 1980 年代有一出动画片集叫｛叮当｝。那时，没有人认识谁｛多拉 A 梦｝。｛叮当｝最能够得到孩子欢心的，就是他百宝袋里的东西。不不，不仅是孩子，他也得到大人的欢心。尤其他的｛随意门｝和｛时光机｝这两件东西，几乎时刻都入前五名人们最渴望百宝袋里的东西。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛随意门｝曾经是｛阿冰｝最想要的，也许是她的性格问题，｛逃避｝事情永远是她最快选择的做法，所以，｛随意门｝是最适合她的，只要心中想著要去的地方，打开随意门马上就去了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;比如：阿冰看见父亲和丈夫的火药味正在发酵中，阿冰打开随意门就可能离开这个火境之地。又或者阿冰给老板骂得头昏脑胀，只要随意门打开，马上又可以逃离压力之区。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，数十年轻轻就过去了，逃避往往不是她的想象，逃避和拖延是互相紧扣，糟糕的事情并没有消失，还是要面对的，不然，可能变得更惨。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;现在的阿冰，她最想要的是一部｛时光机｝。因为阿冰和她的母亲｛秀婆婆｝之间的关系渐渐变得陌生和疏远。阿冰要兼顾自己的家庭、工作以及她的健康，在种种的生活压力下，渐渐忽略了和妈妈之间的沟通，甚至开始对她产生了一些抱怨。秀婆婆则因为年老体衰，对阿冰的态度变得苛刻和冷漠。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;眼见妈妈日渐衰老，阿冰心情哀叹，而且两人的代沟好像越来越重，阿冰心更无奈。没分对或错，阿冰知道自己变了， 母亲从来没变过，也许，问题就是她从来没有变过，没有变过也许都是错。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;吵闹经已是常态，冲突时常有，表达不该有的态度，说出不该说的话，总之，关系破裂，情况严重得无法收拾的地步，阿冰陷入了一种混乱和矛盾的情绪中。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一天，家族传来了一个震撼的消息，秀婆婆突然宣布要断绝和阿冰的母女关系。这样的举动让所有亲友都感到震惊和难以置信，因为阿冰向来是一个孝顺的女儿，大家也觉得她们的关系很亲密。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这件事，只有秀婆婆和阿冰两个人知道。因为，阿冰发现了｛时光机）！她不仅是知道，她亲身经历过。就在二人这样紧张的关系时刻，阿冰突然想到了一个解决的办法...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;时光机！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;她把一切告诉了秀婆婆，关于时光机的一切，时光机可以带她们时光倒流，回到 1955 年，那时秀婆婆还是十五岁，阿冰要和秀婆婆交个朋友，而不是母女。因为，如果有血缘关系，时光机牵涉的事情会变得相当复杂，可能会造成大错特错。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;秀婆婆看过一出电影叫｛难兄难弟｝，是一对父子的故事，儿子回到了父亲的年代，最终他成为了他父亲的朋友，故事很感人，想不到梦幻是可以实现，而且会发生在自己身上。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;最终，她们决定一同使用时光机。秀婆婆决定回到十五岁。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;秀婆婆看到眼前的时光机，它长达 2.2 公尺、宽 1.6 公尺、高 1.28 公尺，重达 538 公斤。秀婆婆喃喃自语，她不会后悔的，因为，她已经老得这样，除了七十岁以上的人，没有人再会明白她的心情和需要！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在时光机｛卡｝一声的启动声中，阿冰和秀婆婆一瞬间就返回去 1955 年的世界。这一次，她们不再是母女，而是彼此平等的女孩，两个十五岁的人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，奇怪的事发生了。阿冰清楚知道自己是谁，清楚事情的发生，清楚看到面前的秀婆婆，不不，是｛阿秀｝，自己的妈妈！。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而｛阿秀｝却什么也不知道，她只觉得阿冰很面善，而且很友善，这个女孩似曾相识，可能曾经是同学，也许是邻居，或者帮过她，总之，一下子她们就成了一对好朋友，从头开始，没有束缚，没有期待。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在这段时间里，阿冰终于看到了一个年轻、充满活力的母亲，这个情景她想象过数百次。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;她们一起逛街、看电影、聊心事。阿冰发现，阿秀的个性和她想像中完全不同。她聪明、善良、勇敢，对生活充满热情。在阿秀身上根本不会看到唠叨或抱怨什么，她们手挽手穿过大街小巷，一起笑、一起玩、一起哭，一起度过了那些被遗忘的时光。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿冰要做一个聆听者，她很想聆听阿秀每一句话。而阿秀仿佛对阿冰有无限的信任，她向阿冰说了很多童年的往事，以后想做的事，十八岁要做什么，廿八岁要做什么，三十八岁要做什么，四十八岁要做什么，噢！四十八岁似乎太老了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;她不想生孩子，因为阿秀的妈妈说，孩子将来一定会嫌弃她的！意思是，阿秀一定会嫌弃她的妈妈又老又丑。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿秀只是刚刚出来工作，想不了那么多，总之，阿秀的妈妈就是这样说。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿冰喃喃自语：啊！原来外婆说过这些话。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，随著时间的推移，阿冰开始意识到，即使没有血缘的枷锁，人与人之间的关系依然复杂。阿冰和阿秀开始有了分歧，有了冲突。阿冰终于明白，问题并不在于是否为母女，而在于人与人之间的理解与包容。阿冰一直认为秀婆婆不理解她，不包容她，但是，她自己呢？她对秀婆婆呢？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿冰意识到，衰老不过是生命旅途中的一站，无奈也是时间无情的烙印。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;当时光机一再启动，将她们带回现实的时候，奇怪的事情又发生了。秀婆婆完全记得时光机以后的事情，面前的阿冰仿佛有了双重关系。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;两人的情感得到了重新建立，彼此更加理解和尊重对方，珍惜彼此的存在。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;时光机不仅让她们经历了一次时空的奇遇，更是一次心灵的旅程和革命。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;完!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;写作日期：2024 年 3 月 19 日&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;开始时间 : 13:16pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;完成时间 : 16:34pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;图.文. 东加豆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我除了写微故事，还制作有声书，希望我们能互相认识。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;喜欢我的文章吗？盼得到您的支持、点赞，或分享我的文章，让我知道创作的路上有你陪伴。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;关于我：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>与何清涟女士商榷：特朗普与拜登政治底色的辨误</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;《联合早报》3 月 12 日刊登了何清涟女士的文章《谁希望拜登连任美国总统》。在文中，何女士认为，拜登得到了美国「社会主义者」等左翼人士的强力支持，民主党人及拜登政府的政策还撕裂了美国社会。而同时，何女士对特朗普及共和党人的政策主张多有同情和理解，对其争议言行颇多辩护之词。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;笔者与何女士的观点甚为不同。一方面是因为笔者是中左翼立场人士，与何女士右翼价值观存在差异。更重要的是，笔者认为，何女士文章中的事实判断即存在颇多讹误，逻辑上也有矛盾。笔者希望在本文中加以厘清和商榷。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;首先，何女士提到，普京声称拜登当选总统更利于俄罗斯。而如今俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，普京政权名声大坏。何女士提及此事，似是要表明拜登和坏人普京是同一方的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这并非事实。恰恰相反，是特朗普和部分共和党人与普京政权亲近，并受其支持，而非拜登等民主党人。美国联邦调查局（FBI）等官方机构、诸多知名媒体，均证实了 2016 年俄罗斯干预了美国大选。普京政权通过制造假新闻等方式，助力了特朗普击败民主党人希拉里。而普京和特朗普之间，也多次相互称赞。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;俄乌战争爆发后，特朗普在公开场合多次宣称，他反对对乌克兰的援助，并暗示要乌克兰割让土地换取和平。许多共和党人也激烈反对援助乌克兰，还在国会阻击援乌法案的通过。而相反，自俄乌战争爆发以来，拜登明确支持乌克兰抵抗俄罗斯，力推援乌法案。拜登政府联合盟国对乌克兰的坚定支持，是乌克兰迄今没有被俄罗斯击败的最重要原因。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;根据这些信息，普京实际上青睐的是特朗普及共和党人，而非拜登与民主党。至于普京在最近采访时希望拜登当选，自然是一种迷惑舆论的谎言。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;第二，何女士关于美国的西方盟国厌恶特朗普、冀望拜登获胜的敍述，是正确的事实。但对此评析时，何女士却认为这是北约盟国自私，把特朗普试图叛卖盟友的行为轻描淡写为「小气」，以及以美国国内经济民生问题，为特朗普拒绝承担同盟义务辩护。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这样的说辞，弱化了北约（及类似的基于普世人权的同盟）互助合作的重要性，淡化了特朗普政策主张对维系同盟的破坏力。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;北约虽然有着种种问题，但在如今国际形势日益紧张的状态下，仍然扮演着非常重要且正面的角色。无论对于打击恐怖主义、遏制俄罗斯侵略、保护成员国安全，都不可或缺。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;作为世界最强国、北约领头羊、国际秩序主导者，美国自然应当承担最大责任。这不仅是美国须为的义务，也是利于美国长远利益的应为之事。美国之所以繁荣强大，并非依靠孤立主义和闭关自守，而是深深参与并主导国际秩序，并促成国家利益与国际共同利益的一致，所造就的结果。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;无论二战中美国领导反法西斯阵营胜利，还是战后至今推动全球化，美国自身都是最大受益者。如果美国放弃对国际事务的积极参与，只会导致美国的没落。没落的美国，在国债、国民养老、国家安全等方面只会比现在更差，而非更好。「皮之不存，毛将焉附」，缺乏盟友支持甚至退出北约的美国，也将更加遭遇威权和极端势力的挑战。美国如果放弃维护国际秩序，让世界陷入丛林，美国自身想做「与世无争」的「世外桃源」也是不得的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;显然，特朗普及部分共和党人为了短期经济利益和节省一些援外经费，而放弃全局和整体的巨大利益，是狭隘和短视的。或许这利于其个人和党派的利益，但对美国国家和人民是得不偿失的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;第三，何女士说，拜登支持者主要是「社会主义者」。这是以偏概全的。而何女士对于拜登和民主党「撕裂美国」的批判，也是以夸大的态度和选择性的方式敍述分析，是混淆了美国复杂政治现实的谬误言论。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;美国青年一代确实有不少人对「社会主义」颇有好感，但第一，这仅限于占美国人少数的青年人；第二，对社会主义有好感，并非就是社会主义者。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;相较于欧洲和加拿大等国，美国政治光谱整体上更加右倾，即便大多数民主党人也更多是自由主义者。左翼政治家、参议员桑德斯，也只是社会民主主义者，而非社会主义者。只有众议院议员亚历山德莉娅·科尔特斯（AOC）这样极少数政治人物算是社会主义者。民主党成员绝大多数都是非社会主义者，只是相对共和党，他们较倾向于大政府、更重视国家干预和社会保障。但根本上当然还是支持自由主义的，而非支持高度集体主义式的苏式社会主义。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而拜登更不属于社会主义者，而是较为中道理性的政治家。一些美国极左人士，包括社会主义者，还因为拜登不够左倾，在劳工、女权、加沙问题上没有足够支持弱势，而抵制拜登，呼吁不要在 2024 年大选中投票给他。这些人在 2016 年大选中也抵制投给希拉里，这些「关键少数」放弃投票，间接造成希拉里的败选。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;何女士还认为，美国民主党正在发动「颜色革命」，改变美国青年人政治立场，让他们成为社会主义者，并演变美国为社会主义国家。这并非事实。美国是一个自由开放的国家，并没有极权专制国家的洗脑和强制，每个人都可以自由选择信仰、自我筛选信息，民主党没有能力决定国民的政治取向。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而美国大学及媒体之所以普遍左倾，是因为他们更为的了解历史、现实，有更丰富的人文知识和广阔的视野、更强的社科分析能力和判断力，也更倾向扶助弱势。他们的价值判断和主张，是基于事实和良知做出的选择，并非是出于私利或捏造事实而刻意塑造的特定立场。就像「1+1＝2」被绝大多数人认可，是因为 1+1＝2 确实是对的，而非是洗脑后的判断。何况，美国主流媒体中，也有华尔街日报等中间派媒体、福克斯等保守派媒体，而并非由左倾者垄断。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而就何女士所说的「无、知、少、女」群体，她们大多数是社会的相对受害者、边缘群体，支持倾向变革、平权、社会公正的民主党，是无可厚非的。虽然过激的变革和平权、过分的「政治正确」是不合适的、不顾现实条件的、应节制和渐进的；但扶助弱势、促进平等、建设多元和包容社会的基本诉求和方向，是正确的、应理解与支持的。不能因为少数激进分子的偏激行为，而对她们一概否定。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;更重要的是，真正促使美国撕裂的，正是特朗普和许多共和党人。特朗普及共和党人鼓吹或实际奉行的白人至上/白人优先主义、基督教原教旨主义、种族主义和极端民族主义立场和政策，以及对女性、LGBT、少数族裔、外来移民等群体的强烈排斥，对这些弱势群体权利运动的攻击，加剧了社会矛盾与仇恨、破坏了美国的包容与多样性，促使美国政治的极化与对立。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;特朗普与共和党人还不顾惯例，强行推举和任命卡瓦诺、巴雷特等保守派大法官，破坏政治平衡。特朗普还长期发表对奥巴马、希拉里、拜登等人的侮辱、谣言、阴谋论等诽谤言论。而 2020 年大选结果揭晓后，特朗普和一些共和党人还拒绝承认选举结果、制造「1.6」骚乱。而特朗普做出这些言行，许多共和党人仍然支持他，才是「不惜代价（也要将特朗普）选成总统」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这些显而易见的事实都证明，特朗普与部分共和党人，才是造成美国社会撕裂的主要责任人。即便民主党激进分子也有责任，也是次要的，且并不能代表民主党主流。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;另外，何女士在文中，还有若干逻辑不自洽的矛盾之处、对引用内容的曲解，以及无的放矢的批评。例如，何女士因《纽约时报》对特朗普的态度，而认为《纽约时报》破坏规则，不可信任；却又在本文中多次引用《纽约时报》的若干民调来反映拜登支持率低、「不得人心」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;何女士借用左派主持人克里斯·华莱士的话「很多媒体机构认为对特朗普报道不用再遵循新闻页一般规则和客观性」，来「证明」媒体对特朗普报道不客观。而事实是，因为特朗普撒谎太多、有大量超出常规的言行，所以无法按照对待正常的守信的政治家方式，对其言行加以评论和检验，而只能针对其独特性格和言论「特事特办」，包括不再对其荒诞不经言论当做正经话一一反驳。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这并非是主流媒体不再遵循规则和客观。就像媒体评价普京政权对入侵乌克兰的各种辩护之词，如「乌克兰国家并不存在」、「俄罗斯从不侵略别国」、「泽连斯基才是战犯」等谰言，难道还有必要每次都假定这些话可信而再去分析、而不直接否定吗？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;何女士一边渲染美国社会主义者的增长和威胁，认为是「社会主义者」推选拜登上位，一边又说许多选民正在离拜登而去。那么究竟美国「社会主义者」是强大还是虚弱呢？美国也确实有少数社会主义者或其他极左人士，而如前所述，这些人反而因拜登不够左倾而抵制拜登，这些「关键少数」拒绝支持拜登，正是拜登民调落后特朗普的重要原因。而何女士却暗示，拜登是因为左倾而失去支持、特朗普更得民心。这又是不符事实的。美国社会主义者不是多数（但是关键少数），拜登并非左倾（而是相对中道），特朗普也并非更得民心（只是相对于民主党人内部的撕裂，特朗普支持者比较团结和坚定）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;何女士指责拜登「若干内政外交举措」导致美国撕裂，却并没有指出举措内容和具体影响。而据笔者所知，拜登政策较为平和，是尽可能弥合社会裂痕的。无论在女权和 LGBT 权利等弱势群体权利问题、边境难民入境问题、巴以问题，都尽可能以较平衡和模糊策略处置，不偏帮一方。虽然这也会导致「两边不讨好（最近拜登民调下滑正是与此有关）」，但也反映了拜登希望尽可能以折中策略解决问题、兼顾各方关切的中庸态度。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;拜登这些政策，与特朗普「一边倒」反难民、反女权、支持以色列的偏激保守政策迥然不同，也比奥巴马、希拉里等进步派激烈推进女权、LGBT 权利、移民融入、支持巴勒斯坦较快建国等进步政策更为和缓。所以说拜登加剧分裂，是对事实的认知错误。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;总之，笔者认为，何女士对于美国政局及总统竞选的看法，是偏颇的、不尽真实的、存在种种谬误的。何女士还选择性的阐述事实，放大拜登和民主党的不足，而为特朗普和共和党的不良行径辩护缓颊。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;笔者难以认同何女士的说辞，才特地写出本文以驳。诚然，笔者是中左翼，不赞同何女士确实有价值观因素。但除了立场差别，笔者也认为何女士所说有不少事实上的讹误。无论立场如何，对于一些基本事实不应否认或修改。而且，既然有何女士这样基于右翼立场、特朗普支持者的文章，笔者也就以中左翼的民主党支持者作文以应，亦是合情合理之义。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;（本文删减版已发表于《联合早报》，封面图片取自半岛电视台）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>论语漫读（35）：何为则民服？ — 孔子主要就是教如何维护统治</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.red-publish.com/book/2990&quot;&gt;电子书：《论语漫读》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;哀公问曰：「何为则民服？」孔子对曰：「举直错诸枉，则民服；举枉错诸直，则民不服」&lt;/strong&gt;（为政第二）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/73024784-7bdf-480c-8c4d-fc14f1324db8.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;哀公是鲁国国君，「哀」是后人给他的谥号，对他一生的评定。谥法上说，「早孤短折曰哀，恭仁短折曰哀」。总之就是死得早没有什么作为的意思。但鲁哀公活得也够长的，生卒年为前 521―前 468 年，53 岁死的。估计是他太碌碌无为了，活得长也只能给个「哀」的谥号。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;哀公就向孔子请教：「怎么做才能让百姓乖乖听话，服从我的统治？」他这么问，肯定是百姓不怎么驯服，对他的统治有所不满，为此而感到焦虑。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;孔子就回答到，「把正直的人提拔起来，放置在徇私的人上面，老百姓就会服从；把徇私的人提拔起来，放置在正直的人的上面，老百姓就不会服从」。「曰」字前面加个「对」，表示提问者的尊重。「举」，提拔；「直」，正直；「错」，放置；「诸」，之于；「枉」，不正直，徇私。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;类似的表述还有，&lt;strong&gt;子曰：「举直错诸枉，能使枉者直」&lt;/strong&gt;（颜渊第十二）。把正直的人提拔起来，放置在徇私的人上面，就能让徇私的人行为合符正直之道。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;孔子这个问答不是个一般化的问答，比如「为政以德」；而是很具体的一个措施，就是如何用人。孔子主张德政，德政有很多方面，而用人只是其中的一项。可能是哀公在这方面做得比较差，用人不当，孔子就有针对性地对症下药。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;古今中外通行的用人原则是「德才兼备」，而孔子这里呢，只强调德，要提拔正直的人，而没有说要提拔有才能的人。这也不意外，孔子更看重德而不是才。但如果提拔的人仅有德，而无才，纵然有公正之心，也无法明断是非和高效地处理政务，也会让百姓不服。将无才之人放置于有才之人上面，也会让有才能的人不服。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;哀公这一问也反映出他的统治目标，那就是如何稳固统治，保持自己的权力。而不是将改善百姓的生活和社会公正当成统治的目的。而孔子及儒家也总是从帮助君主维护统治的角度出发，来为统治者建言建策。孔子要求统治者要善待百姓，但那不是他的目的，而是手段，认为这样才能维持和稳固统治者的统治，维护一个稳定的社会秩序。&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;一无是处&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;马克·费舍/文&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;王立秋/译&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;本文最初发表于费舍的博客&lt;strong&gt;k-punk&lt;/strong&gt;,也刊载于&lt;strong&gt;The Occupied Times&lt;/strong&gt;, March 19, 2014。按 CC-NC-SA 协议译介。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;自青少年时期起，我就断断续续地苦于抑郁。有时，抑郁的发作会让人极度虚弱——它会让人自残、退缩（我会躲在自己房间里一待就是几个月，只有在需要签到或购买维持生命所必需的食物时才会冒险出去），会让人不得不在精神科病房蹉跎一段时光。我不敢说自己已经从那种情况中恢复过来了，但我乐意说，近年来，我抑郁发作的频率和严重程度都大大降低了。这部分是因为我的生活处境发生了变化，但也和我对自己的抑郁及其原因有了不同的认识有关。我把自己精神痛苦的经历拿出来说，不是因为我认为它们有什么特别或独一无二的地方，而是为了支撑这样一个主张，即我们最好通过非个人的、「政治的」而不是个体的、「心理的」框架来理解多种形式的抑郁并与之斗争。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;写自己的抑郁是一件困难的事。抑郁在一定程度上是由一个「内在的」讥讽声音构成的，这个声音会指责你自我放纵——你才没有抑郁呢，你只是在自悲自怜，快振作起来——而公开这一状况本身就可能触发这个声音。当然，这个声音根本就不是「内在的」——它是实际社会力量的内化表达，而否认抑郁与政治相关，是符合其中一些社会力量的既得利益的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一直以来，我的抑郁都和这样一个信念分不开，那就是，我相信自己真的一无是处。在三十岁以前的大部分时间里，我都相信自己永远不会工作了。在二十几岁的时候，我在读研、间歇性的失业和临时性的工作之间徘徊。在承担这些角色中的每一个的时候，我都觉得自己不属于那个身份——在读研的时候，我觉得自己是一路靠装蒙混过关的半吊子，而不是真正的学者；在失业的时候，我觉得自己并不是真的失业，和那些诚实求职的人不一样，我只是在偷懒罢了；在短暂就业的时候，我觉得自己不称职，并且无论如何我都不是真的属于这些办公室或工厂的工作岗位，不是因为我对这些岗位来说「太优秀了」，而是——恰恰相反——因为我学历过高、百无一用，抢了比我更需要、更应该得到这份工作的人的饭碗。甚至当我在精神病房的时候，我也觉得自己不是真的抑郁——我只是在为了逃避工作而装抑郁，或者按抑郁极其矛盾的逻辑来说，我只是在为了隐瞒我没有能力工作、社会中根本就没有我的位置这个事实而装抑郁而已。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;当我最终在延续教育学院找到一份讲师工作的时候，我一度欣喜不已——但就其本质而言，这个欣喜恰恰表明，我还没有摆脱一无是处的感觉，而不久之后，这种感觉又使我陷入了更长时间的抑郁。我缺乏那种「天生我材」的冷静自信。在某个并不潜藏的层面上，我显然依然相信自己不是那种能够胜任教学工作的人。可这种信念从何而来？主流的精神病学认为，这样的「信念」源于大脑化学机制的功能失调，可以通过药物来加以纠正；众所周知，精神分析和受其影响的各种疗法到家庭背景中去寻找精神痛苦的根源，而认知行为疗法则不那么对定位消极信念的来源感兴趣，它只想用一套积极的故事来取代它们。倒不是说这些模型全错了，而是说，它们没有把握到也必然把握不到这种自卑感最可能的原因：社会力量。对我影响最大的社会力量是阶级的力量，不过当然了，性别、种族和其他形式的压迫也会通过生产同样的自卑感——即认为自己「在本体上」、自己的「存在」本身低人一等——起作用。这种自卑感最好的表达，就是我在上面说明的那种想法，即认为自己不是那种能够胜任被指定给主流群体的角色的人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在我的书《资本主义现实主义》的一位读者的敦促下，我开始研究大衞·斯梅尔 (David Smail) 的作品。斯梅尔是一名治疗师，但他把权力问题放到了治疗的中心。他证实了我摸索到的那些关于抑郁的假设。在他的重要著作《苦恼的起源》(&lt;strong&gt;The Origins of Unhappiness&lt;/strong&gt;)，斯梅尔描述了阶级的印记怎样被设计为不可磨灭的。对于那些从一出生就在接受这样的教育——「你就是低人一等」——的人来说，获得资历或财富并不足以消除他们自己心中或他人心中的那种在生命初期就已经烙在他们身上的原始的无价值感。一个走出自己「本应」占据的社会领域的人总是面临着被眩晕、恐慌和恐惧感压倒的危险：「……被孤立，被断联，被充满敌意的空间包围，你突然就没了联系，没了稳定，没了支撑；一种令人眩晕、让你厌恶的不确定占据了你；一种彻底失去身份（的感觉）、一种彻底彻尾的欺诈感威胁着你；你没有权利在此时、此刻住在这个身体里，穿这样的衣服；你什么也不是，而确切来说，‘什么也不是’正是你觉得自己正在变成的那个东西。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一段时间以来，统治阶级最成功的策略之一就是「责任化」(responsibilisation)。这种策略鼓励底层阶级的每个个体成员认为他们自己的贫困、缺乏计划或失业是他们自己的错并且只是他们自己的错。个体会怪自己而不怪社会结构，无论如何，统治阶级都会诱导他们相信实际上并不存在社会结构这种东西（它们只是弱者才需要的借口）。斯梅尔所说的「魔幻唯意志论 (magical voluntarism)」——即相信每一个个体都有能力使自己成为自己想要成为的一切——是当代资本主义社会的主流意识形态和非官方宗教，真人秀「专家」、商业大亨和政客都在推行这套。魔幻唯意志论既是当前阶级意识处于历史地位的结果，也是其原因。它是抑郁的反面——它的底层信念是，我们都要为自己的痛苦承担独一无二的责任，因此我们活该受苦。如今，英国的长期失业者身上被强加了一种特别恶毒的双重束缚：这些一生都在接受「你一无是处」的信息的人同时又被告知，他们能做他们想做的一切。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我们必须认识到，英国民众对紧缩政策的听天由命的顺从，是一种蓄意培养的抑郁的后果。这种抑郁表现为接受（对除少数精英外的所有人来说）情况会变得更糟糕，接受有工作就不错了（所以我们不应该工资能跟上通胀的步伐），接受我们无力承担福利国家的集体准备金。集体的抑郁是统治阶级再压服计划的结果。一段时间以来，我们越来越接受这样的想法，即认为我们不是那种能够采取行动的人。就像抑郁的个体不可能通过「振作」就「一下子摆脱抑郁」那样，这并不是意志的失败。阶级意识的重建确实是一个艰巨的任务，一个没法通过现成的方案来完成的任务。可哪怕我们集体的抑郁告诉我们不行，这个任务也还是可以完成的。发明新形式的政治参与、重振已显颓势的制度、把私人化的不满转化为政治化的愤怒：这一切都可能发生，而一旦发生，谁知道它会带来怎样的可能性呢？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>微故事: 小猪的美食 (东加豆)</title>
            <description>&lt;h2&gt;微故事: 小猪的美食 (东加豆)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;很久很久以前，在一个偏僻的山村，有一只小猪名叫｛小猪｝。不知道牠是幸运还是不幸，牠一出生，父母就把牠卖到了农场，然而，农场主人后来又嫌弃牠，这猪生得又瘦又丑，没有几両肉，把牠拿去猪肉档也没人要，煮牠也不够一餐吃，又浪费油、盐、糖、火，就一手把｛小猪｝扔出门外。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;正当小猪快要饿死的时候，有一个妇人拾起牠。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;妇人没有杀牠，也没有卖掉牠，她收留小猪，而且搭建了一个猪笼屋给牠，是浅啡色的。从此，小猪的生活发生了翻天覆地的变化。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;妇人叫做｛麻英｝。其实小猪并不知道妇人的名字，牠只知道有小孩叫她｛嫲嫲｝，有朋友叫她｛阿英｝，所以小猪就叫她｛麻英｝。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在小猪记忆中，牠一生第一餐的食物是｛豉油鸡翼｝。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛麻英｝笑咪咪捧住一大碟的豉油鸡翼，从厨房行出饭厅，而且怀著一种期待的心情。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;他闭上眼睛，微笑著豉油鸡翼的味道。他感受到咸中带甜的豉油味、姜味、葱花，与鲜嫩多汁的鸡肉完美融合，让他心满意足。他从心底感激这道美食，｛小兄｝的脸上写尽了无限的幸福，这种情况麻英最开心，｛小兄｝是麻英儿子。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/21c40be8-9524-4e3b-9799-26c8de5c3152.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;再无知的小猪，牠也知道自己是一只猪，而牠是被人收养。虽然小兄对牠不错，麻英也很宠爱牠，至少，小兄吃什么，小猪也吃什么，然而，猪和人始终是不同的。小猪接过豉油鸡翼，咬下去，吃！吃完一只又一只，却没有所谓好吃不好吃，吃豉油鸡翼对牠来说，仿佛是在完成一个任务。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;传闻中的猪潲和猪杂，小猪从未尝过的，甚至未见过，因为牠根本没有这个机会。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;今天，麻英煮了三味撚手小菜。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;梅菜蒸肉饼、丝瓜鱼肉、雪梨猪展汤。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ad98ce9d-c030-4048-a78e-f4d207cb22da.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛梅菜蒸肉饼｝，麻英是不会用碎肉机弄出来的，因为它无法达到人手剁肉的效果，人手剁肉的肉粒大小和结构也不同，它能够保留部分肉筋与纤维，使肉饼有丰富的层次感和咀嚼感，吃起来更有韧性，还有肉粒间有空隙，更容易释放肉质的香气，使肉饼香气更浓。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛小兄｝一口咬下去，梅菜和肉混合而成的酱汁随即爆出来，他爱死这种味道，爱死这种感觉，｛汤水｝也是人间美食，那清甜的雪梨配上鲜嫩的猪展，简直天衣无缝！同时，这也是｛家｝的味道。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0025465c-48fa-408d-a76e-fbaab7201167.jpeg/public&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，小猪也在吃，吃是牠的例行公事，吃是牠的本能，饿了就吃，饱了就上厕所，累了就睡，天天如是。至于那味｛梅菜蒸肉饼｝牠并不了解什么层次感，牠只知道它是甜和咸的味道。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这条山村真不好，这里竟然没有牛、羊、鸡、海鲜吃，能吃的也昂贵，大家一年到晚都是吃猪肉。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;日子一天天过去，小猪从一个瘦弱的小家伙，长成了一个健壮的大猪，可是，牠并不了解这家人，也不了解什么是｛家人｝，牠甚至乎不了解自己。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;牠问过｛麻英｝和｛小兄｝，为什么会收养牠？可是他们并没有回答牠。小猪已经是大猪，牠认为牠可以自由了，所以，牠决定在这里吃最后的晚餐。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;小猪偷偷溜进厨房，牠看著麻英忙碌的背影，心里涌上了一股说不出的感动。这种感觉，牠从来未有过。当然，麻英并不知道小猪会离开她的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;今晚的菜式是，煎石班、豉汁蒸排骨、素炒，还有大菜糕作为甜点。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9b814af3-33ab-4d1a-b174-aa370bd875d0.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;香煎石班鱼，金黄酥脆的鱼皮、鲜嫩多汁的鱼肉，满口生香，令人回味无穷。应该说是令｛小兄｝回味无穷，｛小兄｝也成长了，他也长成了大兄。他从小到大都一样，每样食物都是美，生活中的都是美，这个家，一切都是美，让他深深体会到何谓人生之乐！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9ec338c8-5c0f-4ecf-aead-2a727ab68f9f.jpeg/public&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，小猪吃这几道菜如同过去时光，这次却添加了苦涩味，因为牠知道这是最后的晚餐，是作最后告别。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b4d0800b-b29c-4de6-ae7f-e413f8990218.jpeg/public&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;适应性攀岩小组与芝加哥、纽约州、马萨诸塞州当地岩馆合作，组织日常的室内攀岩活动，为不同需求、年龄、性别和障别的朋友提供支持服务。图源：Adaptive Climbing Group&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;在适应性攀岩小组，我们喜欢让攀岩者和志愿者轮换结对的分组，而我则借助这个机会来观察不同残障攀岩者的动作，并与 ta 们进行一些关于攀岩意义的对话。我最初的打算是与小组的适应性攀岩者进行一些半正式的采访。这种采访方式可以让我记录下 ta 们的想法，并帮助我得出更多基于经验证据的结论。但后来我放弃了这条道路，因为我不习惯以一个访谈者的角色去和岩友们开启会话。我转向试着观察 ta 们的攀岩情况，并将更多与攀岩有关的抽象问题嵌入我们平时的聊天中。这使我避免了提及更多知识化的问题，如 「你如何定义或描述攀岩」，而转用更日常的措辞，如 「你喜欢/不喜欢攀岩吗？」或「你最喜欢攀岩的部分是什么？」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这些攀岩者的回答颇具启发性，涉及到了诸多与攀爬动作和实践有关的基本元素。正如一位攀岩者所描述的（我曾辅助这位女性攀爬过几次），她最喜欢攀岩的地方在于它对身体所激发的挑战。她描述了攀爬怎样使她能够动用全身、让肌肉和身体的其他部分发力，而这些是针对性的治疗性锻炼通常容易忽略的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;说到&lt;strong&gt;「全身的肌肉参与」&lt;/strong&gt;，我自己在攀岩中也经常注意到，因为新的动作能促使我收紧某些平时不太觉察的身体部位。当我辅助攀岩时，一些新的肌肉参与也非常明显。协攀者的主要任务在于与主攀者协调动作，置放手和脚，或提供背部借力以及抬升支持。这需要特定的心智敏锐度、身体协调性、有效的沟通以及推动动作，而个人攀登则涉及不到这些。我曾与其他残障攀岩者交流相关经验，大家的反应是一致的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/85a96b45-6a48-4dbb-ac2c-beac28484486.jpeg/public&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;为了平衡挑战难度与对攀岩者的帮助程度，其中所需要的身体关注意味着攀岩者和保护团队就像一个攀岩的集体单元，大家一起努力完成攀爬。图源：Adaptive Climbing Group Chicago@BKB West Loop&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;当然，顶绳保护员的工作也有类似的特点，尽管由于其位处地面而相对不那么明显。然而，对于一组地面保护员，尤其是当与需要帮助升高、拉下手柄上升器等支持的坐式攀岩者组队配合时，必须与对方、攀岩者彼此协调，以精准把握拉动绳索的力度。为了平衡挑战难度与对攀岩者的帮助程度，其中所需要的身体关注意味着攀岩者和保护团队就像一个攀岩的集体单元，大家一起努力完成攀爬。&lt;strong&gt;这些不同形式的攀爬根植于社群，实现了社群和攀岩之间的连续性——许多健全中心主义的商业岩馆向往于此，但往往无法实现。&lt;/strong&gt;事实上，「社群（community）」几乎出现在我所遇到的几乎每一个攀岩馆的使命宣言里，然而，我（包括许多其他跟我交谈过的成员）经常感觉到这些攀岩馆中强烈的个人主义与其所声称培养的「社群精神」之间的脱节。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我对适应性攀岩小组成员墙上动作的观察证实了关于挑战和集体的探讨。Ta 们也在重新定义大多数攀岩者认为的「好」或「强」的技术。这些攀岩者让我领悟到，摇晃、颤抖、手脚摸索、呼唤支持、抽动、休息、快乐或恐惧的尖叫，以及对话，都是试图在攀岩墙上控制身体的方式，强大、有用也有益。对于这些攀岩者来说，攀岩不应拘于狭隘的定义，那关乎挑战、风险、信任、乐趣、社群、创造力、新奇和变化。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;最后，小组成员反复向我表达的一个观点是，抱石对 ta 们遥不可及，因为不愿意接受自己的身体可能无法控制或承受的跌落。由于缺乏绳索支持，许多适应性攀岩者自动被抱石攀岩排除在外了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;03. &lt;strong&gt;打造一个无障碍的抱石馆&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;抱石是我第一次接触到的攀岩项目，也是我最主要练习、最喜欢的项目。而且，正如我在上文所提及的，抱石是在岩馆里排除残障者最严重的攀岩形式之一。根据我关于攀岩等级、攀岩定线的健全中心主义性质的分析，以及与残障攀岩者的对话，我试图重构目前以健全者为中心的岩馆，通过工具辅助或者人际支持，让攀岩墙和攀岩变得更加触手可及。我试图关注岩馆的建成环境来展现残障攀岩者眼中攀岩最重要的部分。&lt;strong&gt;这样的攀岩馆将承认并庆祝集体形式的攀岩，并消除赋予非残障攀岩者特权的等级系统。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;尽管如此，我的提议只是一个起点——它根植于与残障者的真实对话和经验，探讨对攀岩本身的基本理解。我的设计方法最接近于通用设计的理念，试图为尽可能多的身体和心智提供途径（Hamraie, 2013）。当然，我不可避免地抱有「偏见」——我赤诚相信，只要有适当的机会，每个人都可以拥有畅快的攀爬体验，无论是高墙还是矮墙。（事实上，这里提出的许多想法也可以适用于顶绳岩馆。）在实现这一个人梦想漫长反复迭代的过程里，这个设计方案是一个开端。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;尽管其实攀岩体验在攀岩者进入岩馆的大门之前就已经开始了，不过，我将把我的设计方案的范围聚焦于对攀岩行为本身最具体的运动环境。因此，本文将不会讨论无障碍通道、桌子、照明、音乐、座位、停车场、浴室/衞生间设施以及其他设施，如举重室或瑜伽室。当为残障人士设计时，岩馆环境中的这些元素是创造舒适和「栖居（dwelling）」感受的重要落点，并且，已经在关注无障碍的残障研究文本中得到了充分的讨论（Bauman, 2014, p. 390）。而攀岩墙这一相对小众的主题在目前关于无障碍的文本中还未被涉及，因此，我尝试对此加以探讨。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我倡议的无障碍攀岩馆，&lt;strong&gt;最显著特征在于以多角度的自由攀爬墙（spray wall）取代确定或「设定好」的路线；同时取消所谓的「定线员」，而建立一个由残障与非残障攀岩者组成的「攀岩工友（Climbing Staff）」，负责为攀岩者提供互动支持，协助其使用设施；以及在所有攀岩墙上安装可选的绳索支撑。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在我的想象中，岩馆的「攀岩工友」与攀岩者一起攀爬，提供帮助，并确保馆内所有攀岩者的安全。攀岩工作人员分散于馆内，身着易于辨认的制服，ta 们将协助设置绳索保护系统，并协助攀岩者根据我在下文概述的机制设计自己的攀爬。关键在于，工作人员将由各种外形、身材、肤色、能力和性格的经验丰富的攀岩个体组成。Ta 们还将观察、记录场馆里任何对攀岩者来说不可及之处，并有权启动再设计。与攀岩者在地面与墙壁上共处的经验将使工作人员与攀爬空间亲近而熟悉，充分理解改善的入口。我希望这将使设计持续发生，不断完善岩馆的环境。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/a78aab47-d954-4f8c-a645-ca4173a8a97c.jpeg/public&quot;

            <title>823 父亲养成指南：从只出一张嘴的猪队友，进化成参与育儿教养的新时代神队友</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;野兽按：今天看到一本《父亲养成指南》，被该书的副标题逗笑了。于是谷歌了一下看看这本书的介绍和节选，觉得蛮有意思，还看到还有王浩威兄的推荐，于是下单购买了一本。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img

class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;父性是天生内建，还是后天习得？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;从「我」到「我们」，男人如何调适成为父亲的过程？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;爸爸也可能罹患「产后忧郁症」？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;如果你对「父亲」身分感到好奇，&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;或面临以下情境，&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;一定不能错过这本书！&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;◆&lt;strong&gt;「什么都我在做！」&lt;/strong&gt;──哀叹自家没有神队友的妈妈&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;◆&lt;strong&gt;「我顾不来，孩子也只要妈妈……」&lt;/strong&gt;──也想晋升老婆心目中神队友的爸爸&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;◆&lt;strong&gt;「我们的生活不再只是两个人了！」&lt;/strong&gt;──即将展开育儿旅程的家庭&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;◆&lt;strong&gt;「到底该如何理解『父亲』角色？」&lt;/strong&gt;──想了解最新「父职」研究者&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;「为人父母」是许多人经历最深刻改变生命的经验之一。然而，相较于母亲，父亲在这段过程中遭遇的冲击和困境，却往往遭到低估，甚至被忽略。事实上，父性与母性的概念同样深刻，对孩子的成长、家庭运作与社会稳定皆影响深远。妈妈怀孕时，爸爸会借由想像孩子的模样、未来与孩子的互动关系，进而思考自己希望成为什么样的父亲。这段过程中，爸爸的贺尔蒙也会因此发生类似妈妈的变化，令男人逐渐进入「父亲」这个新角色。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;现代双亲共同担任教养者的现象逐渐成为主流，双薪家庭、小家庭的比例提升，加上更认知到父亲角色对孩童发展的关键影响，促使男性对亲职参与展现出前所未有的积极态度。但这批新时代的爸爸不免面临各种疑问：&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;‧怎样才算得上是称职的好父亲？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;‧初为人父的焦虑该如何排解？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;‧父职会带来何种心理与生理上的改变？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;而这些爸爸的另一半，也可能会受这些烦恼所苦：&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;‧为什么伴侣没办法立刻进入父亲的身分，担负起顾家及育儿义务？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;‧我该如何理解并支持他走过扛起父职的过渡期？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;作者安娜．麦菁博士是牛津大学实验心理学系的演化人类学家，专注父职研究将近十年。在本书中，她从五十万年前的父亲如何确保人类种族的存续，又与今日父职经验有何种关联说起，探讨家庭中的「父亲角色」与「父职经验」。《父亲养成指南》不是一本教人成为完美父亲的教战手册，而是让爸爸们畅所欲言，从全新观点来带领读者思考父亲本质，检视「身为父亲」的科学、社会、文化意义，协助新手爸爸能以轻松愉快的心情踏上「为人父」这趟富有挑战性的旅程！&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;【国内外好评推荐】&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;王浩威／精神科医师&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;丘美珍／妈妈悦读基地创办人&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;邦妮＆盖瑞小夫妻／医师作家&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;吴凤／金钟奖主持人、作家&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;林仁廷／咨商心理师&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;陈其正（丑爸）／亲职教育顾问&lt;br

class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;很喜欢这本探讨父性的书，从生物学、人类演化和文化环境……等等，多面向的探讨了爸爸的角色，也帮助我了解自己那些内心的矛盾与困惑，相信读者们看完后，也能在担纲父亲身分上更加游刃有余！&lt;strong&gt;──邦妮＆盖瑞小夫妻／医师作家&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;「父亲是什么？」父亲是带领孩子进入社会，开始冒险与探索的前导示范，与母亲相异却同等重要。本书阐述了父职在亲职面不是仅为协助者，而有其独特意义，值得一读。&lt;strong&gt;──林仁廷／咨商心理师&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;多年来，我尝试透过人类、心理学等理论，帮助母亲们看见父亲在育儿的困境与挑战。终于有了这本书，就让更专业的来！&lt;strong&gt;──陈其正（丑爸）／亲职教育顾问&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;对于母职，我们累积丰富的描述、讨论和颂赞，面向父职，却几近一无所知。一直以来，父亲多半等同养家者形象，安娜•麦菁从科学的角度，揭露父职滋养、照顾与爱的多元面貌，献给思考如何作父亲的每一个你。&lt;strong&gt;──梁莉芳／东华大学社会学系助理教授&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;这是英国著作啊！世界排名占前的男性育婴大国，从家电广告到流行电视剧都有不少爱家男人全职父亲的桥段，周六早晨的公园里只有爸爸与孩子，亚洲无法相信的奇景处处上演。别再笑英国研究领先全球数十年，有妈妈看不下去，帮天下老公出书解套，你，看是不看？&lt;strong&gt;──隐藏角色／别人的老公&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;安娜．麦菁集结了最新的父职研究与新手爸爸的真实故事。这是一本发人深省、鼓舞人心与感动你我的著作。&lt;strong&gt;——尼克．威尔基（Nick Wilkie）／英国慈善团体国家生育信托执行长&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;是时候开始将科学应用在实际的父职领域了。真实的父职经验与社会对父职的认知依然差距甚大。《父亲的新角色》所敍述的科学发现，带给我们突破困境的信心。&lt;strong&gt;——邓肯．费雪（Duncan Fisher）／家庭推广组织（Family Initiative）创办人，曾获颁大英帝国官佐勋章（OBE）&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;探讨家长身分被遗忘的父亲，精彩至极。准爸爸与妈妈的必读之作。&lt;strong&gt;——罗宾．邓巴（Robin Dunbar）／牛津大学教授&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;这本书以最新研究为基础，感动人心、资讯丰富，而且通俗易读。值得每一位家长与（外）祖父母、以及所有健康、教育和社会照护领域的专业人士拜读。&lt;strong&gt;——艾德里安娜．伯吉斯（Adrienne Burgess）／父职研究所（Fatherhood

Raeburn）在《父亲重不重要？让科学告诉你！》（Do Fathers Matter?: What Science Is Telling Us About the Parent We’ve

Life of Dad : the making of a modern father），却是一位女性人类学家，在研究了大量父亲和准父亲后撰写出来的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;过去十年，牛津大学实验心理学系的演化人类学家安娜．麦菁（Anna Machin），勾勒出从受孕、蹒跚学步到以后的旅程中，小孩如何需要父亲，其中包括异性恋和同性恋的父亲。 这本书不是假设父亲应该是什么，不是本谈「应然」的书，而是本谈父亲本来面目的书，探讨的是「实然」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;《父亲养成指南》详细解释了生物上和生活经历如何把男人变成父亲。父亲对孩子的塑造也对孩子及其未来产生积极影响。麦菁也鼓励父亲要有发言权，可以彼此分享经历和感受。虽然她举的许多案例来自她土生土长的英国，但是对其他社会仍很有参考价值。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;《父亲养成指南》指出，在过去的五十年里，英国父亲的角色发生了翻天覆地的变化，台湾也有异曲同工之妙。父亲不再希望被限制在养家糊口和管教者的角色上，而是想成为真正的共同父母，为孩子提供一样的养育和照顾。产生这种变化的部分原因，两地也差不多，有双薪家庭的增加、以医院为基础的产后护理的减少以及大家庭的消失，让照料新生儿没父亲介入下滞碍难行。我有不少已婚女性朋友甚至都要老公承诺一些养育子女才怀孕生育。这个转变也让愈来愈多父亲们感到他们其实有能力参与其中，并且清楚他们对孩子和家庭跟妈妈一样重要。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;从上世纪七十年代开始的英国，父亲成为分娩室的常客，如今，有超过九成的男性参加了孩子的出生。在台湾，老公陪同老婆一起分娩也愈来愈常见。尽管有研究证据显示，准爸妈把分娩视为一种团队经历。但是许多父亲仍然觉得自己有点像备用品，而不是平等的参与者。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因为妈妈在分娩过程中经历重大的身体体验，让人忘了爸爸也在经历著重大的心理和生理变化。分娩时刻的参与，对父亲与孩子建立情感纽带，以及在心理上承担「爸爸」的职责都很重要。在科技的帮助下，男人还可以稍微体验一下分娩之痛哦！近年就有不少台湾网红争先恐后地尝试：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;法规对父亲参与新生儿的出生与照顾非常关键。台湾目前《性别工作平等法》的陪产检及陪产假规定是：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;「受雇者陪伴其配偶妊娠产检或其配偶分娩时，雇主应给予『陪产检及陪产假』七日；『陪产检及陪产假』期间薪资照给；雇主依规定给付『陪产检及陪产假』薪资后，就其中逾五日之部分得向中央主管机关申请补助。但依其他法令规定，应给予『陪产检及陪产假』逾五日且薪资照给者，不适用之。补助业务，由劳动部劳工保险局办理；『陪产检及陪产假』七日，除陪产检于配偶妊娠期间请假外，受雇者陪产之请假，应于配偶分娩之当日及其前后合计十五日期间内为之」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;其中「陪产检及陪产假」是 2022 年初从五日修订成七日的，虽然是进步，但和 OECD 国家（经济合作暨发展组织）的陪产假中位数为 2.1 周相比，显得超扣门，对解决少子化问题几乎没有帮助吧？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;传统上，大家都认为母性是本能的，但父性是后天学习到的。事实上，爸爸和妈妈一样在生理基础上为当父母做了准备。所有新进父亲在出生前后，都会经历睾固酮的永久性下降，甚至在某些情况下高达三分之一。 这一下降至关重要，因为它不仅让男人成为一个善解人意和亲力亲为的父亲，而且还消除了高睾固酮对形成情感纽带的激素之抑制作用，确保父亲与新宝宝的互动中自我感觉良好。再加上这种大脑变化，增加了养育、注意力、同理心和解决问题的能力。麦菁主张，别把父亲降级为次要育儿角色，他们当得上一个真正的共同父母。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;《父亲养成指南》指出，除了挑战性别化的育儿角色外，同性恋父亲还告诉我们很多关于父亲大脑巨大弹性的资讯。从对异性恋父母的研究中得知，妈妈和爸爸在与孩子互动时表现出不同大脑活动，这反映了他们演化上不同的角色。但对主要照顾者同性恋父亲的研究显示，在没有母亲的情况下，这些父亲在「妈妈」和「爸爸」的大脑区域都表现出相似的活动。显然同性恋父亲可以扮演好照顾孩子所需要的一切。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;《父亲养成指南》指出，父亲也会与他们的孩子建立深刻而强大的纽带，这种纽带与母子之间的纽带一样牢固，但却又截然不同。妈妈和爸爸都有建立在教养基础上的纽带，但爸爸有额外的挑战，这反映在他们帮助孩子进入家庭以外的世界方面所扮演的角色。无论在哪个文化之中，父亲都会突破舒适圈，让孩子接受风险和挑战，这有助于他们建立在快速变化和充满挑战的世界中生存所需的身心适应力。他们做到这一点的最有效方法之一就是透过和孩子玩那些最好别让妈妈看到的游戏。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;父亲和孩子玩的是较粗暴的游戏，在快速而激烈的活动中，孩子们被抛到空中，在房间里飞来飞去，被疯狂挠痒而尖叫和咯咯笑。这是一种几乎完全由父亲进行的游戏形式，除了充满乐趣之外，它在情感纽带和儿童发展方面也起著至关重要的作用。由于具有挑战性和风险性，这样的游戏能够培养所有孩子都需要的互惠、同理心、风险评估和克服挑战的技能。这样的父子玩耍，是与妈妈一起玩耍无法取代的。这是演化而来的天性吧，难怪我只要看到小小阿宅，都有把他们捉来用力捏一捏、扭一扭、摔一摔再抛到空中的冲动⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;身为人类学家，麦菁也在《父亲养成指南》指出，父亲的形式是多元的，男人以多种方式履行他们的职责。虽然在西方现代社会，爸爸就是亲生父亲，但是其他地方的情况并非一定如此。「爸爸」就是站出来做这项工作的人，可以是祖父、叔叔、朋友或老师。有些孩子甚至有一整个爸爸团队。决定父亲是谁的因素通常是环境因素的混合，包括经济风险以及文化规则，因为父亲不像母亲那样受到生物学上的限制。随著现代社会中主要是以小家庭的模式在经营，因此她建议我们可以向世界上的爸爸们学习，并打开眼界，扩宽我们对成为爸爸意味著什么的看法。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我老婆和朋友看到我的书柜有这本《父亲养成指南》，都露出诡异的表情⋯⋯但我还是得说，这是本值得所有想当好爸爸的朋友一读的好书，而且妈妈或想当妈妈的朋友更应该好好一读，了解一下老公能够如何成为神队友哦！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;《父亲养成指南》：与孩子出生前的关系，大部分来自爸爸的想像力与努力&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;我们想让你知道的是&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我们知道象征怀孕与分娩所形成的神经化学物质——催产素与多巴胺——也存在爸爸体内，但作用的强度远比妈妈弱，所需的时间和努力也比妈妈多。然而，进化机制并没有让爸爸只能靠想像参与怀孕的过程，还有一招可以帮助爸爸进入父亲身分：睪固酮是让男孩蜕变成男人的荷尔蒙。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;文：安娜・麦菁（Anna Machin）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;对大多数的爸爸而言，越到伴侣怀孕后期，他们与胎儿的依附关系就越深厚。然而，一些爸爸在培养这种关系的过程并不顺利。部分男性（如以下提到的吉姆）可能欠缺适当的父职角色模范，部分则需要克服心理障碍，还有一些则会与孩子的妈妈产生冲突。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;儿子出生之前，我花很多时间在思考，我应该做什么？扮演什么角色？父母在我很小的时候就离婚了，当爸爸对我来说是非常困难的事情，因为我没有一个真正的父亲典范可以学习……。我的父亲与我感情疏远，他只在周末来探望我、和我说笑，但我想成为关心儿子与花时间陪伴他的爸爸，而不是像我父亲那样没有机会和自己的孩子相处。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——尚恩（六个月大）的爸爸吉姆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;在此情况下，评估爸爸在孩子出生前与胎儿的依附关系，有助于判断亲子关系未来会遇到的问题，进而对整个社会产生广泛的影响。如在第十章所见，身为父亲，与孩子的关系有可能对他们的行为、情绪与心理发展造成深刻影响，这些与母亲对孩子的任何影响不大相同。在紧密的亲子依附关系中，父亲能促使孩子拥有良好的心理健康、鼓励他们独立自主，并支持他们的行为和语言发展。但是，如果亲子依附关系不健全，便有可能对孩子、家庭及社会造成负面影响。与父母关系不稳定的孩子，比一般人更有可能出现反社会行为、成瘾与心理问题。康顿在胎儿依附关系的研究中发现，爸爸与胎儿的依附连结——连同父母之间的感情——最能预测宝宝出生后与他的感情会有多深厚。这是一项极为有力的研究，因为可以借此辨别需要巩固的依附关系，甚至在孩子出生前就能提早发现。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;爸爸与孩子在产前的关系，大部分都归功于爸爸的想像力与努力，这些包含想像孩子的模样与未来和他／她的感情、尽可能与肚子里的宝宝互动、花时间思考希望成为哪一种父亲。以提姆为例：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;我希望我有与宝宝培养出感情……这很困难，感觉就像你对肚子里的宝宝说话，而他根本不知道你是什么人或是你在干嘛。虽然如此，我跟他说很多话，也经常抚摸妻子的肚子。我希望得到参与感。几天前，我们玩了击掌游戏，我轻拍妻子的肚子，而肚子里的宝宝也回应我……。他有可能只是在打嗝，但这种感觉真的很棒、很酷。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——即将成为父亲的提姆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;我们知道象征怀孕与分娩所形成的神经化学物质——催产素与多巴胺——也存在爸爸体内，但作用的强度远比妈妈弱，所需的时间和努力（撇开分娩不谈）也比妈妈多。然而，进化机制并没有让爸爸只能靠想像参与怀孕的过程，还有一招可以帮助爸爸进入父亲身分。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;很多人说睪固酮（testosterone，又称睪丸素）是让男孩蜕变成男人的荷尔蒙。在胎儿长到六至十二周大时于子宫内分泌，使男婴长出阴茎与睪丸，并促成脑部的发展。多数人认为男婴出生后，有赖于睪固酮及其对大脑发育和行为的影响，他们才会偏好男生的玩具，还有将棒状的物体都当成刀剑或手枪玩耍。在青春期，睪固酮控制脂肪与肌肉的分布以及骨骼的发育，使青少年的下巴、肩膀与胸部变宽，也促进胸部、脸部与生殖器毛发的生长。这种荷尔蒙决定了你将会是多称职的伴侣与父亲。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;长期以来，人们认为血液里睪固酮含量较多的男性比较容易吸引伴侣。可能的原因有二：男性受到睪固酮的影响有更多动力追求女性，以及女性偏好下巴宽大、胸部肌肉发达的男性（这样比较能保护她们、给予更多的安全感）。然而，当男人决定与一个女人长相厮守、组成家庭，之前带来助益的大量睪固酮突然间变成了阻碍。虽然他试著专心扮演忠诚伴侣与父亲的新角色，但荷尔蒙会驱使他继续寻找其他伴侣，因而危害到任何需要他照顾的后代。这个现象称为「挑战假说」（challenge hypothesis），而其本身无疑也是种挑战。这个假说由英国动物学家约翰・温菲尔德（John Wingfield）率先提出，试图解决男性如何在有小孩之前对伴侣忠诚，在生儿育女之后又能成为尽职父亲的难题。办法是，睪固酮必须牺牲。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;现实的确如此。在来自不同文化的父亲，从实行一夫多妻制的塞内加尔农民、重视子女教育的以色列中产阶级、四处播种的菲律宾男性、努力赚钱养家的加拿大白领阶级、不与妻子同住的牙买加男性，再到我自己英国父亲族群，这些爸爸体内的睪固酮含量远比非人父者低，无论他们是否与小孩同住。我们知道睪固酮含量较低的男性比较会安抚小孩，会更希望与伴侣共同养育孩子，对孩子的同理心与感情也胜过睪固酮较多的男性。睪固酮是父性行为各有不同的主要因素。我们将在第六章深入探讨这个部分。问题来了，为人父者体内的睪固酮含量普遍比没有小孩的人夫少，是否纯粹因为睪固酮含量较少的男性生了小孩？还是当了爸爸之后，睪固酮的分泌量就会减少？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;美国伊利诺州（Illinois）西北大学（Northwestern University）的学者李・格特勒（Lee Gettler）提供了解答。在其开创性的五年研究中，格特勒与同事追踪一群菲律宾男性展开伴侣关系与当了爸爸之后的变化。研究人员在这些菲律宾男性还是单身时，测量其睪固酮基础值。五年后，再度拜访这群男性。在研究初期接受测试的六百二十四名男性中，其中有一百六十二人在这段期间第一次当了爸爸。这些人在研究初期睪固酮含量位居群体之冠，但是五年后的睪固酮数值是受试者当中最低的一群。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;那些依然单身与已有伴侣但没有小孩的男性，其睪固酮的含量则没有明显变化。格特勒找到答案。体内睪固酮含量高的男性比较容易找到伴侣，当爸爸之后睪固酮含量减少的程度也最大。睪固酮含量会受到父亲的身分所抑制，虽然分泌量在孩子出生的前几周略微增加，但再也没有回复到当爸爸之前的程度。生物的进化选择了一种机制，让男人成功兼顾单身男子与尽责父亲互相冲突的需求。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;《父亲养成指南》：父亲对于青少年子女的发展，如同对学步幼儿一样重要&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;我们想让你知道的是&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;当母亲还在处于怀孕与哺乳的无限循环中，父亲在孩子的青春期发挥十分重要的作用，负责管教孩子逾矩和负面的行为，并扮演教师与向导的角色。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;文：安娜・麦菁（Anna Machin）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;父亲在儿童发展中的角色&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在人类史绝大部分的时间里，父亲据信对子女的发展毫无贡献。一般认为，孩子的口语能力、运动神经与音乐或创作天赋，全是从与母亲之间紧密且独有的连结而来；关键在于母亲一个人的影响力。亲生父亲无疑贡献了一些基因，但人们认为，成长环境是最重要的因素，而这个环境由持续照顾与养育孩子的母亲所维护。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;身为演化人类学家，我实在无法接受这种看法。这否定了进化的基本规则：效率。进化机制是自然世界中一板一眼的会计师。它会尽力透过最有效与最具成本效益的可行路径来达成目标——物种的生存。但是，人类似乎希望借由极其复杂的方式来解决生存危机，方法就是创造相对罕见的父职角色。如此一来，人类的合作、生理构造、交配行为与生命史会经历重大变化。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一直以来大多避免互相接触的男性与女性，突然间必须合力进行性行为以外的事情，男性的大脑必须进化才能教导与照顾孩子，成人必须与连续单一配偶制所主导的生命历程妥协，还有青少年这种生物也出现了。有了这些演变，我们难道不开心？这是巨大的变迁，而且极具风险。如果人类要能经历生物机制与行为的重大变化、进化要推动这些改变，为人父者就必须赋予孩子某种独特且关乎生存的事物。他必须对子女的发展发挥影响力。这一章我想探讨，孩子人生初期与通往青春期的崎岖道路上，父亲具有什么样的影响力。在开始讨论之前，需要先认识人类组织生活的独特方式，还有为何只有人类物种的父母，必须面对爱耍脾气的学步儿童与爱理不理的青少年。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;精力是人生的货币，而「生命史」意指人在一生中投入精力的方式。所有动物的精力都是有限的，大致分为三种投入方式：发育、生命的维持与繁殖。一个人选择如何将精力分散在这三个领域中，将深刻影响自己的一生，包括何时喝奶、何时第一次交配、一次生下多少后代、长得多大及活得多久。就拿背部毛发为银灰色的黑猩猩与田鼠，两种体型差异甚大的动物来说好了。我们知道，妻妾成群的银背黑猩猩必须发展与维持壮硕的体格，才能控制群体、击退有意竞争的成年雄性并保护家人。这会消耗牠大部分的精力，但因为牠除了偶尔心不在焉地陪孩子玩耍与容许他们偷吃食物之外，并不会照顾儿女，所以幸好牠实际上在繁殖方面付出很少，只有一些精子而已。因此，牠一生的大部分精力都投入在发育与生命的维持上。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;对比之下，天平的另一端是雌性的田鼠。这种小型生物在出生仅十天后便能进行繁殖，寿命最多只有一年。牠在发育和维生方面消耗的精力极少，但极度早熟的性征与每三十五天可生下多达十四胎的能力，代表牠在繁殖投入大量精力。不同于可在圈养条件下活到五十五岁的黑猩猩，这种小老鼠体现了「活在当下，不求长寿」而这句谚语。相较之下，尽管一些人认为自己拥有及时行乐的灵魂，但人类肯定属于银背黑猩猩的这一边；因为我们从为期不短的童年开始发育，再缓慢进入老年阶段。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而生命史另一个面向是发育阶段的数量、发育阶段出现的时间点及持续的长度，同样会受人类分配一生精力的独特方式所影响。按一般规则，奉行「活在当下，不求长寿」信念的人，倾向迅速度过发育时期来到成人及生育的阶段，速度越快越好。相反地，如从第一章所知，拥有巨大脑部的人类需要慢慢发展成熟，而且在发育阶段耗费多年的时间。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;包含人类近亲灵长类动物在内的大多数哺乳类动物，会经历三个阶段：婴儿、少年与成人。他们从无法离开奶水的小毛头，变成令人头痛又精力旺盛的青少年，再成为发育成熟的大人。然而，正如人类通常会有的情况，我们已经脱离这个传统的模式了。如今，人类的生命史分为五个阶段：婴儿、儿童、未成年、青少年、成人。这使我们成为独特族群的一员，而且可能是唯一的成员。一般认为，只有鲸鱼和海豚有资格加入我们。这些物种的共通之处是脑部的体积异常庞大，因此，后代在发育成熟之前，需要更多时间成长与学习善用大脑以确保生存。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;童年时期是摸索的阶段，让我们结交朋友、克服困难、探索外在世界，还有但愿能发展出对知识的热爱。然而，在生命史的世界里，这个阶段被无趣地定义为嗷嗷待哺与独立饮食的时期。蹒跚学步的幼儿在发育初期需要喂奶，再来需要大人喂养固体食物，相信那些曾被苹果切片与食物搅拌机整得半死的家长们非常清楚，这就是童年阶段。一开始，帮忙妈妈照顾小孩的人是女性亲属，但从五十万年开始，如第一章提及，孩子的爸爸接下了这个角色。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;另一个独一无二的阶段是青春期。今日，在这个成长阶段，孩子情绪起伏剧烈，热中探索性吸引力、社交生活与创造力，也偏爱奇装异服的打扮。对乔瑟夫等爸爸而言，这个机会可以让他们深切思考，如何帮助孩子度过这段充满挑战的时期，好让他们成为具有自主能力的大人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;我和父亲关系很好，但其实我不太喜欢这样，我希望他能质疑我在青春期的一些想法，但他或许有一些考量所以没有这么做。我希望跟孩子发展与培养一段关系，随著他们进入青春期与开始发展个人特色，应该会产生越来越多如何面对生活中的问题、挑战与机会的疑惑，而我希望与他们建立亲近的关系，这样才能在他们尝试解决困难的同时展开对话。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——乔瑟夫（四岁）与里欧（两岁）的爸爸约翰&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;正式说来，青春期的定义是骨骼停止生长与性征开始发育的阶段。关于为什么会出现这个阶段，众说纷纭，但最有可能的原因是，它让人类巨大的脑部完成发展，并让个体能够习取重要的生存知识，不会因为求偶的强烈欲望分心。关于青少年大脑的研究显示，其实是脑部发展飞快的时期，尤其是前额叶皮质（掌管理性思考）仍处于建构阶段，表示青少年倾向在杏仁核的驱使下冲动或情绪化地回应情况，未能仔细思考最合理的行动。听来耳熟？当母亲还在处于怀孕与哺乳的无限循环中，父亲在这个时期发挥十分重要的作用，负责管教孩子逾矩和负面的行为，并扮演教师与向导的角色。研究指出，父亲对于青少年子女的发展，如同对于学步幼儿与孩童的影响一样重要；他们的角色与行为会随著儿女逐渐长大而有细微变化。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;青少年阶段先讲到这边，我们暂时回顾一下幼年时期。从前面的章节中我们知道，父亲与子女的紧密连结对健康的发展至关重要，这种关系在生命最初的一千天尤其关键，因为这段期间大脑正在快速发展。二○一五年，莱顿大学（Leiden University）的黎安・考克（Rianne Kok）率领一群荷兰科学家展开关于一百九十一名儿童的前瞻性研究，探究家长的照顾行为对孩童脑部发展有何影响。这项研究的前瞻性表示，研究人员即时追踪孩童的发展，在受试者年仅六周大时展开研究，而不是调查过去的发展以找出关联（即回溯性研究）。他们首先募集一群刚出生的婴儿，然后进行脑部超音波扫描与量测头围，作为研究的基准数据。之后的八年期间，除了在孩子满一岁时评估家长与孩子玩耍时的敏感度，还有在孩子三、四岁时观察问题解决游戏中的亲子互动之外，都没有打扰这些家庭。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;亲子互动的实验阶段过了四年，也就是这些家庭的孩子满八岁时，再度登门拜访，并对儿童脑部进行核磁共振扫描。借此了解大脑的详细构造，包含灰质与白质的比例。之前提过，灰质是神经元，白质则是连接神经元的轴突，使大脑的不同区域可以互相沟通。理论上，灰质越多与白质密度越高，大脑就会越「聪明」，因为它拥有越多的神经元，而神经元随著连结增加，越能互相沟通。这样错纵交织的神经结构，让我们得以展现人类物种在认知方面的弹性与复杂性。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;他们发现，父母在玩耍与问题解决活动中敏感度较高的孩子，脑部总容量大于其他儿童，因为他们大脑中的白质与灰质比较多。如同感情融洽的父母与孩子会呈现一致的催产素分泌量，宝宝从父母身上看到的正面行为，也会反映在其大脑结构。大脑中的黑质（或灰质）与白质，证明了家长的行为会深刻影响子女的发展。实在不可思议。在这项研究中，对孩子需求敏感的家长，实际上提供了孩子结构性的生活基础，并且赋予他们神经架构，让他们得以成长茁壮。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure

            <title>论语漫读（34）：多见阙殆，慎行其余 — 孔子是「打太极」的老祖宗</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.red-publish.com/book/2990&quot;&gt;电子书：《论语漫读》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子张学干禄。子曰：「多闻阙疑，慎言其余，则寡尤；多见阙殆，慎行其余，则寡悔。言寡尤，行寡悔，禄在其中矣」&lt;/strong&gt;（为政第二）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/96e59a8d-b10e-45af-93e8-d27e333a4851.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子张&lt;/strong&gt;，复姓颛孙、名师。子张是他的字；陈国人。他比孔子小四十八岁，与曾参年纪相仿，或者在孔子流亡陈国时入门，或者是在孔子结束流亡回到鲁国后来投奔孔子的。他性情比较急躁，爱出风头，有些像子路。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;他向孔子请教如何做官。「禄」指俸禄，「干」是谋求，「干禄」就是谋求俸禄，引伸开来就是如何保住官职。因为保住官职才能挣取俸禄。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;孔子针对他的毛病，回答他说，「要多听别人的意见，不要说自己拿不准的。拿得准的意见，也要谨慎地说，这样才能少犯错误；要多观察，拿不准的先搁下，拿得准的，也要谨慎地去做，这样才能少后悔。说话少过失，做事少后悔，就能保住官职俸禄」。 「阙」是搁置的意思，「尤」是过失，「殆」是困惑。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;孔子这段话，总的意思就是做官要少言少行，慎言慎行，明哲保身。孔子考虑到了为官的两种情形，一种是建言建策，比如说君主或主管问事情怎么办？臣僚、参谋或下属需要回答，提出自己的建议。另一种是自己是管事的，独挡一面，需要做决断，怎么办？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;中国历史上会说话的典故比较多。例如，唐高宗李治继位后，欲废王皇后而改立武则天，褚遂良等元老重臣则极力反对，甚至以死相谏。但李绩却说：「此陛下家事，何必更问外人」。既不反对也不赞成。怕说错了话事后遭来忌恨，甚至掉脑袋。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;又比如曹操捉拿到吕布后，吕布表示自己愿意投降，辅佐曹操定天下。曹操却问刘备：「何如？」刘备则回答，「公不见丁建阳、董卓之事乎？」意思是建议曹操杀掉吕布。虽然先前吕布向刘备请过情，让他帮自己说好话，刘备也答应了。但曹操这一问，刘备领会到曹操决意要杀吕布，不管自己怎么说，都会杀吕布。但又想借自己的口说出来，好维护自己渴求人才的名声。刘备这时倚靠着曹操，不敢惹曹操不高兴，只得顺着曹操的意图说。而刘备也没说得很直白，而是拿吕布反叛丁原和董卓来说事。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;官场上，职责不清是常事。这也给了「多见阙殆，慎行其余」的机会。遇着可能担责的事，不同衙门、部门就相互推诿，俗称「打太极」。或者实在推不开，就拖着压着不办，希望靠时间能拖过去。反正是「多一事不如少一事，少一事不如没得事」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;可以说，孔子是中国官场打「太极拳」的老祖宗，讲究说话含蓄，滴水不漏，办事推诿。原因还是在于人治之下，说真话的风险太大。缺乏信任，勾心斗角、相互倾扎，内耗严重。&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Iranian rebellion, the role of Russia and the responsibility of intellectuals.

rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://matters.news/@MIAzh/%E4%B8%8E%E5%BC%97%E9%87%8C%E8%BE%BE-%E9%98%BF%E6%B3%95%E9%87%8C%E4%B8%80%E8%B5%B7%E8%A7%A3%E5%BC%80%E4%BC%8A%E6%9C%97%E5%8E%86%E5%8F%B2%E7%9A%84%E7%9F%9B%E7%9B%BE-%E5%A5%B3%E6%9D%83-%E9%98%B6%E7%BA%A7%E7%9F%9B%E7%9B%BE-%E4%BC%8A%E6%96%AF%E5%85%B0%E5%8E%9F%E6%95%99%E6%97%A8%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89-%E5%B7%A6%E6%B4%BE%E9%94%99%E8%AF%AF-bafybeid5dv4rn7aqjvowgzkkvkuirmhmkopdqqkczjx4he5xe2lhmk5cla#_ftn4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;。他们明白，这些戴头巾的命令是更多更加糟糕的事情发生的前兆。起初，一部分伊朗左翼支持这些妇女，甚至还有一些左翼男子前来示威，来保护妇女免受伊斯兰原教旨主义者的攻击。但即使是支持妇女示威的一部分左翼人士，也在几天后告诉她们：「你知道的，你们应该停下来，因为这真的让人们分心，忘了我们斗争的主要目标，那就是反对美帝国主义。」当这些妇女被告知应该回家的时候，这无疑是一个巨大的挫折，他们没有得到她们所需要的支持。最近兴起的「妇女、生命、自由」运动确实认为自己是那些早期妇女努力的继承者。他们对当时站出来反对强制戴头巾的女性感到自豪。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/be7c7099-149b-45cc-b13b-31422e5301d6.jpeg/public&quot;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;保罗·马夏尔（PAUL MARTIAL）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 年 8 月 3 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一台脚踏车&amp;nbsp; 译&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/88788f59-4017-4f32-9203-7b702bb85170.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;跨国公司不仅掠夺在非洲对计算机硬件的制造至关重要的自然资源，而且还在极端条件下剥削非洲大陆的工人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;人工智能（AI）的出现需要对大量数据进行下游识别，以提高其算法效率。为了执行这些任务，几乎 90% 的高科技公司求助于外包公司。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;内容识别&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;在法语国家，摩洛哥、突尼斯或毛里求斯的公司估计可节省 30% 以上的成本，马达加斯加可节省 50% 以上的成本。马达加斯加拥有近 250 家 BPO（业务流程外包）机构。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;那里的工作条件非常糟糕。法国广播电台 RFI 报道了员工的经历：「培训师出现在我们身后。如果他们认为您处理简单图像的时间太长，他们会向您发出警告。如果第二次发生，他们会直接把你送回去。例如，如果你没有完成一天应该做的 200 项任务，你必须继续工作。并且这不算加班费。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;至于工资，他们的底薪约为每月 90 欧元，对于高素质的员工，最高可达 500 欧元。除了识别数据的繁琐工作外，其他 BPO（业务流程外包）还提供审核服务。它们被 Facebook（脸书）、TikTok（抖音）、Instagram、Twitter（推特） 等主要社交网络公司使用。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;对心理健康的危险&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sama 就是这样一家位于肯尼亚的 BPO 公司。其员工整天都在处理极端暴力的内容，包括谋杀、酷刑和对妇女和儿童的性暴力。他们给它贴上标签，把它输入到社交网络过滤器和人工智能的算法中。对他们的心理健康的后果是严重的，相当于创伤后应激障碍。这家肯尼亚公司从未为其员工建立过心理支持结构。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;更糟糕的是，为了用当地语言进行节制，Sama 从东非和南部非洲各国招募了年轻的毕业生，而这些毕业生往往是贫穷的。它把他们带到了肯尼亚，却没有警告他们这份工作的真正性质。该公司只谈到了行政工作，忽略了他们必须忍受的日常与网络仇恨对抗的问题。一到肯尼亚，这些年轻工人就被困住了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;抵制和组织&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;2022 年 5 月，前员工丹尼尔·莫塔恩 （Daniel Motaung） 对 Facebook 母公司 Meta 及其分包商 Sama 发起了初步投诉。投诉的重点是工作条件、薪酬问题和缺乏心理支持。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;当 Sama 停止其审核并解雇员工时，其他投诉接踵而至。肯尼亚法院已暂停解雇，等待裁决。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;与此同时，尽管雇主采取了恐吓政策，150 名员工还是成立了第一个非洲内容审核员工会。其他员工，例如接管 TikTok 审核活动的公司 Majorel 的员工，已经宣布他们决定加入工会。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;尽管受到主要社交网络团体的鄙视，但版主在打击网络仇恨方面发挥着至关重要的作用。失败可能会产生严重的后果。另一场针对 Meta 的审判正在埃塞俄比亚进行。在提格雷战争期间，要求谋杀居住在首都亚的斯亚贝巴的提格雷大学教授的呼吁在 Facebook 上流传了几天。尽管他向社交网络进行了陈述，但消息仍在继续流传。他被凶手枪杀了。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;原文链接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article8194&quot;&gt;https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article8194&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h2&gt;取消第三世界债务委员会（CADTM）的声明&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 年 6 月 26 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一台脚踏车&amp;nbsp; 译&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;摩洛哥金融交易税收协会-取消第三世界债务委员会（ATTAC-CADTM MOROCCO）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/04349577-b694-4bc4-a421-c1614fedda04.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;贾瓦德·穆斯塔克巴尔（Jawad Mustaqbal）&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;贾瓦德·穆斯塔克巴尔（Jawad Mustaqbal）的手机被黑客入侵，他接到不明身份的人打来的威胁电话，这些人打算玷污他的声誉，威胁他的家人，并试图在经济上勒索他。他们还发布了一段显示他独自一人赤身裸体的视频。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这次卑鄙的袭击是破坏我们的贾瓦德同志和摩洛哥交易税收协会信誉的失败企图，他是该协会现任国家秘书处的成员。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;贾瓦德一直积极参与各种形式的声援我国的政治犯，包括摩洛哥摩洛哥金融交易税收协会成员奥马尔·拉迪，他本人也面临证明对他的政治拘留和对他判处六年徒刑是正当的诽谤和捏造肮脏指控的企图。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;贾瓦德从小就从事反对压迫和帝国主义的斗争。他是第一代加入摩洛哥金融交易税收协会并在摩洛哥战斗了 20 多年的人之一。他在大众教育方面做出了许多贡献，并分析了帝国主义中心经济和压制了被压迫者和正义的捍衞者的政治制度的征服本质。他还为摩洛哥的尊严和自由提出了大胆的替代方案。他参加了 2 月 20 日运动和摩洛哥所有主要的民众运动，捍衞了他们的解放内容和基层组织形式。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我们可以理解这次卑鄙袭击的确切目的，正是在我们看到贾瓦德积极参与组织 10 月份在马拉喀什举行的反对世界银行和国际货币基金组织的社会运动反峰会的筹备工作的时候，针对他的声誉。除了在摩洛哥金融交易税收协会（Attac Morocco）中发挥作用，建立国家协调机制，作为摩洛哥反峰会的热门基地外，他还通过在取消第三世界债务委员会（CADTM）联合国际秘书处的成员身份，在国际、区域和大陆层面动员了众多工作组。他所做的一切都是为了让反峰会成为真正的国际盛会。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;贾瓦德遭受的这次袭击反映了对他所从事的活力和动员的恐惧。肇事者的目标是停止这一活动，以便压迫者可以在马拉喀什庆祝他们自己的婚礼，马拉喀什已成为世界富人的宴会厅，接待了世界上最重要的贫困和不公正的创造者，正如贾瓦德所写的那样。作为反峰会筹备工作的一部分，来自北非和中东的激进组织协会组织的网络研讨会也遭到了类似的卑鄙攻击，但被成功挫败。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这种针对活动家和战士的肮脏攻击和卑鄙手段破坏了他们的声誉，这是专制政权的特征，他们害怕任何暴露其暴政的动员。我们的同志贾瓦德·穆斯塔克巴尔（Jawad Mustaqbal）作为取消第三世界债务委员会（CADTM）和摩洛哥遭到了收协会成员遭到了的国家的攻击。国家继续骚扰我们的协会，并剥夺了我们续签注册的权利。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我们摩洛哥遭到了收协会强烈谴责针对我们的同志贾瓦德·穆斯塔克巴尔的卑鄙袭击，以破坏他的斗争和信誉。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我们在此申明：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;对他和他的家人表示绝对的声援。&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;呼吁所有国家、地区、大陆和国际斗争组织扩大对贾瓦德·穆斯塔克巴尔的声援运动，并谴责这种对活动人士的卑鄙攻击。&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;宣布我们决心参与在马拉喀什举行的反对世界银行和国际货币基金组织的反峰会的筹备工作，并动员全球、大陆、区域和国家层面的广泛参与。&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;我们表示决心继续为另一个摩洛哥而斗争，一个有尊严、自由和社会正义的摩洛哥。&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 年 6 月 24 日&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;原文链接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article8142&quot;&gt;https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article8142&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>希腊婚姻平权：回归传统还是时代创新</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;第四分队长　投稿&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/a940872e-52ba-4b8d-8c52-36e19ff9cae4.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;图、法案通过后欢庆的人群，路透社&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;公元前 371 年，古希腊城邦底比斯和斯巴达之间爆发了一场冲突。斯巴达军人的勇武之名，在 300 勇士誓死抵抗波斯大军的温泉关一战中名留青史，而这次，底比斯组织了 300 人的圣军从战阵侧翼包抄并彻击退了斯巴达人，改变了古希腊历史的走向。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;时间来到两千多年后的 2024 年 2 月 15 日，希腊议会通过了同性婚姻法案，让希腊回归了人文传统。时任希腊总理基里亚科斯·米佐塔基斯 (Kyriakos Mitsotakis) 在法案表决后即刻发布公告，难掩其心中的激动，他写道：「这是巨大的一个里程碑，反映了今天的希腊——一个进步、民主的国家。」&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;从上古神话开始，奥林匹亚诸神在选择伴侣方面也同样自由。宙斯、阿波罗、厄洛斯、狄俄尼索斯、赫耳墨斯、阿尔忒弥斯、雅典娜等等，故事中不不缺少同性爱情的桥段。西方哲学的奠基人之一，柏拉图在《会饮篇》中记载他的七位门徒分别对爱神厄洛斯的颂辞；「少年是爱的最高体现。」保萨尼亚认为：「属于天上的爱，是高尚的、值得追求的。」阿伽松认为爱是宇宙的创造者，是万物和谐的源泉，他赞美了少年的美貌和纯真，认为爱少年是爱美的体现。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;少年爱（paiderastia）正是古希腊所特有的一种同性伴侣关系，通常是一个年长的爱者（erastes）与教育、保护、爱，并为他年少的被爱者（eromenos ）提供榜样、传授知识和技艺，直到后者长出完整的胡须，这段关系便会中止。作为底比斯执政官，伊巴密浓达想到利用这一点，便秘密集结起 150 对少年爱伴侣，让他们接受特种军事训练，以击败斯巴达人的军队。《伊利亚特》里写下了伊巴密浓达对这些伴侣的赞颂：「爱，只有爱情的力量是无坚不摧的！再凶悍的咆哮野兽在爱的面前也只会悄悄地溜走。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/caac02bc-bc74-4807-bf27-efdf25a7b07b.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;图、公元前 480 年记载少年爱的陶器 Wikipedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;几乎同时期，古希腊女诗人萨福在她的诗歌《致阿那克托里亚》中写道：「我曾以为我已经不再受爱情的折磨，但当我看到你，我的心又开始剧烈地跳动。」这首诗歌正是描写萨福与一位女性情人的情愫，而她所居住的莱斯波岛也成为了后世对女同性恋的称谓（lesbian）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;文学、戏剧、雕塑、绘画这些流传千年的遗存，无不说明同性恋深入到了古希腊社会的每一处毛孔之中。此后古希腊成为罗马帝国的一部分，文化被罗马帝国全方位的吸收。罗马帝国五贤帝之一的哈德良与希腊青年安提诺乌斯拥有一段同性恋情。安提诺乌斯意外身故后，哈德良终身未婚，他用各种方式纪念爱人安提诺乌斯，城市以他的名字命名，为他设立雕像至今依稀可见。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;变革发生在罗马皇帝君士坦丁一世后，他先是颁布了《米兰敕令》，宣布基督教在罗马帝国境内合法化，并给予基督徒与其他宗教信仰者同等的权利。君士坦丁一世本人也皈依了基督教，并在临终前接受了洗礼，这一系列事件标志着基督教在罗马帝国的正式确立统治地位，&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;出于平民信仰的价值观，基督教教义中对社会中上层普遍出现的婚外情、未婚先孕、同性恋等行为视作负面。此后在希腊民间，同性恋者的身份和同性关系逐渐转入地下，大体上相安无事。但因 1054 年东西教会分裂，帝国东部教会改称东正教，不同于西方基督教经过了加尔文、马丁·路得等进步学者的改革，东正教依然承袭了自中世纪以来形成的价值观。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;东正教的宗教仪式庄严隆重，充满了神秘感，同时东正教认为，圣经应该按照传统进行解释。教会的权威人士应该负责解释圣经，信徒应该服从教会的权威。东正教对传统的极端重视，到今天东正教的神职人员全部留长胡须，颇有身体发肤受之父母不可毁伤的意味。同时东正教会对信徒的离婚进行审查，确立了非必要不离婚的标准，以此尽量减少离婚的发生。而同性恋则被斥为彻底的异端，完全隐匿在历史当中，至今东正教会仍是希腊内部反对同性婚姻最大的推手。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1832 年，在爱琴海岸斗争近 400 年后，现代希腊终于从奥斯曼土耳其的压迫中独立。希腊社会选择走向现代化，同时希腊兴起了启蒙运动，推动了文化的世俗化。到 1929 年，希腊政府颁布法令，将宗教教育从公立学校课程中剔除，这标志着希腊走向世俗化的重要一步。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;二战胜利后，希腊全面回归西方传统，在 1951 年完成同性关系合法化（受到奥斯曼土耳其的影响，在独立后的 1834 年刑法当中同性关系属于犯罪行为）。西方未必只有英美，传统未必只有耶稣，在这一点的反例正是是「第三罗马」自居的俄罗斯，出台了各种打击 LGBT 群体权益的规定，美其名曰捍衞家庭价值。而希腊社会经过几十年的现代化与世俗化以后达成的共识，两种传统未必要争个高下，两种婚姻也不须让出存分。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9ff0268b-46d8-45a9-9fba-dfcf87409354.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;图、米科诺斯岛&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;1985 年，一群同性恋者在创立了「阿基里斯」（Achilles）组织，这是希腊第一个性少数群体权益组织，组织的名称正是呼应了古希腊传统。作为上古神话中英雄传说的一部分，孱弱男孩帕特罗克洛斯代替爱人出征，并且战死沙场，也让爱他的阿基里斯为他复仇，并在死后葬在一起。二者的故事既表现了同性爱情的忠贞，也提现了古希腊人民的勇武与奋进。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿基里斯组织举办研讨会和讲座，提高公众对同性恋的认识；出版杂志和书籍，传播同性恋文化；还为同性恋者提供法律援助和心理咨询。正是有了阿基里斯这样组织对古希腊传统的不断再演绎，希腊社会对同性恋和同性关系的认识不断革新，个体之间不再是是简单的隔空批判、站队和扣帽子。第四国际在《论同志的解放》中指出，同志群体的解放的路径之一，就是充分发掘本民族文化中的同性恋传统，而不是污名化 ta 们。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;新世纪前后，希腊的性少数群体迎来一波小的解放。先是举办了 pride parade，然后是反歧视法当中加入禁止性倾向歧视的条款，这些都是希腊性少数权益运动的重要里程碑。作为支柱产业的旅游业者也张开双臂迎接世界各地到来的游客，雅典、米科诺斯、塞萨洛尼基等一些希腊岛屿，成为欧洲最受欢迎的 LGBT 旅游目的地之一。每年在雅典、塞萨洛尼基、帕特雷和克里特岛首府伊拉克利翁举行四次 pride parade。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f4318082-fb30-47f5-af8d-b6aa91aaec7c.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;图、2022 年希腊雅典 Pride Parade NBC&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;正当希腊社会上下充满信心地走向 21 世纪的时候，2008 年的金融海啸席卷了这个人口刚刚超过 1000 万的爱琴海国家。伴随着金融海啸的余波，希腊政府入不敷出，并在 2010 年宣布破产后引发了一系列的债务危机。随后欧盟援助希腊并以自由主义的方式对希腊进行改造，手段包括削减福利开支、裁撤政府机构以及市场化的改革，这些措施导致希腊经济陷入衰退，失业率和贫困率大幅上升。女性成为了受害者，她们当中很多人被迫成为全职主妇，理由是自然是给男人们腾出工作岗位。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2011 年，一些希腊女性自发成立了「女性反危机运动」，旨在团结女性力量，共同应对危机带来的挑战。另一些草根组织，如「妇女反对债务和紧缩」（Women Against Debt and Austerity），「妇女为另一种世界」（Women for Another World）等，通过网络、小组、讲座等方式，提高女性的政治意识和参与度，呼吁女性团结起来，抵制性别歧视和不平等。那一年，希腊女性们在雅典举行了一场名为「愤怒的母亲」的大规模示威游行，以复仇三女神之一的厄里倪厄斯之名抗议政府对女性福利的削减。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;为了度过这场危机，希腊草根组织开展了「社区诊所」（Community Clinics），「社区厨房」（Community Kitchens），「社区药房」（Community Pharmacies）等，为贫困和失业的女性提供免费的医疗、食物和药品，缓解她们的生活困境。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;根据评估欧洲国家 LGBT 权利的 ILGA-Europe 最近进行的报告，希腊在过去十年中在 LGBT 人群的法律和政策状况方面取得了 49 个国家中进步最大的国家之一。希腊女性的一系列自组织运动，让性别议题成为继文化、地域和职业之后又一大推动社会革命的利器，借助一系列的努力，2013 年议会选举中女性议员的比例首次突破 30%，这在代议制民主的国家中是一个很了不起的数字。希腊女性的行动反过来促进了性别平等，更为后来的婚姻平权奠定了基础，就在同一年，希腊最高法院裁定，禁止同性婚姻违反宪法。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2012 年的选举中，没有任何一个政党或联盟能够赢得多数席位，但是反对紧缩政策的激进左翼联盟（Syriza）大幅提高了得票率，从 4.6% 跃升到 16.8%，成为第二大党。到了 2015 年，希腊再次提前举行了议会选举，激进左翼联盟以 34.6% 的得票率再次赢得了第一大党，与独立希腊人续组联合政府。劳工权益、福利保障、性别平等乃至婚姻平权都是左翼联盟所关心的议题，也是欧债务机时期推动希腊草根组织互助、自助的动力之一，它们提现了社会主义运动的群众性、自发性与进步性。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在激进左翼联盟执政以后，民事伴侣关系得到希腊当局的首肯，同性伴侣可以通过注册获得认可。与婚姻不同，民事伴侣关系的法律效力相对较弱，仅限于双方在协议中约定的内容。如无其他规定，民事伴侣关系存续期间所得的财产，默认为各自所有；民事伴侣之间不享有法定继承权；民事伴侣一方不能单独收养子女等等。民事伴侣制度的出现符合现代经济和文化条件下不同类型的伴侣双方的需求，却不能从根本上替代婚姻，因而导向真正的问题是，婚姻关系意味着什么。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;总理米佐塔基斯在投票前的辩论中对议会表示：「那些一直被忽视的人最终将在我们周围出现，与他们一起，许多人最终将找到自己应有的位置。」他说：「改革让我们一些同胞的生活变得更好，但并没有从许多人，的生活中夺走任何东西。」因为婚姻平权要所实现的，是完全的，不带任何附加条件的平等。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2015 年后，希腊经济逐渐恢复，难民问题成为受到关注的议题。2019 年 7 月，激进左翼联盟在议会选举中败给了中右翼的新民主党，齐普拉斯下台，新民主党领导人米佐塔基斯成为新的总理。后者在应对新冠疫情和与土耳其的东地中海争端方面表现出积极的态度，与欧盟国家加强了合作和关系。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/bff43983-f5d5-4aa0-a85b-ee6a38ae660e.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;图、议会外抗议立法的群众的 BBC&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;米佐塔基斯有意推动进行婚姻平权的改革，但不是所有人都支持。表决的时候许多人在首都宪法广场打出横幅、举起十字架、朗诵祈祷文并唱诵《圣经》中的段落。东正教教会领袖伊罗尼莫斯大主教表示，这项措施将「破坏祖国的社会凝聚力」。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;最终 254 名议员参加了投票，176 票赞成，76 票反对，Metron Analysis 最近进行的一项民意调查显示，尽管 62% 的受访者表示支持同性婚姻，但 69% 的受访者反对同性生育。激进左翼联盟主席索克拉蒂斯·法梅洛（Sokratis Famello）的发言引起了强烈反响，他在议会发言中强调，「历史将铭记，新民主党没有足够的能力推进改革」。 「激进左翼联盟议会集团已经证明，它长期以来一直支持婚姻平等改革，而激进左翼联盟政府 2015-2019 年期间的立法已经铺平了道路。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;新的法案还赋予同性伴侣收养权，这在很大程度上缓解希腊人口出生率低下的问题。40 岁的历史学家尼科斯·尼古拉迪斯 (Nikos Nikolaidis) 表示：「这对于人权来说是非常重要的一步，对于平等来说是非常重要的一步，对于希腊社会来说也是非常重要的一步。」希腊跨性别者支持协会成员埃尔米娜·帕帕迪玛 (Ermina Papadima) 表示：「作为一名希腊公民，我感到非常自豪，因为希腊现在实际上是最进步的国家之一。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;参考资料&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wikipedia：LGBT rights in Greece&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;路透社：Greece legalises same sex marriage in landmark change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBC：Greece legalises same-sex marriage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Athens Embraces its Queer History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Left Must Link With Progressive Forces in Middle East to Stop Regional War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;﹝伊朗﹞弗里达·阿法里（Frieda Afary）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2024 年 2 月 8 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;米勒，译&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/84a6970a-f402-4737-92a4-805581d7eb75.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;在林肯纪念堂举行的纪念玛莎·日娜·阿米尼（Mahsa Zhina Amini）和示威者的烛光守夜活动中，透过照片中展示的被伊朗政权杀害的抗议者的照片，可以看到华盛顿纪念碑。该活动标志着阿米尼被谋杀一周年，也是「妇女、生命、自由」运动的开始。Ali Khaligh / Middle East images / Middle East images via Afp via getty images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;伊朗和美国的进步人士必须横向联系起来，抵制军国主义，因为我们的领导人正在将他们的威胁逐步升级。&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;自 2023 年 10 月 7 日哈马斯对以色列发动野蛮袭击，以及以色列对加沙发动种族灭绝式的入侵以来，在美国政府不愿呼吁立即停火的背景下，关于中东地区可能爆发地区战争的说法不绝于耳。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;作为一名与伊朗、美国、以色列和巴勒斯坦的活动家有联系的美籍伊朗社会主义女权主义活动家，这些事态发展让我感到震惊，既因为纯粹的暴行和无辜生命的丧失，也因为真正进步人士的声音被扼杀。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 月 2 日，美国在伊拉克和敍利亚对伊朗军队和伊朗支持的民兵组织进行了军事打击，造成包括平民在内的 39 人死亡；2 月 7 日，美国对巴格达的袭击导致一名伊朗支持的民兵组织高级领导人及其两名护衞人员死亡，一场更广泛的战争可能正在向我们袭来。美国最近一次袭击是对伊朗支持的伊拉克民兵对美国驻约旦基地的无人机袭击的回应，该袭击造成三名美国士兵死亡，数十人受伤。伊朗政府则警告称将采取反报复行动。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;美国和英国还对也门的胡塞武装发动了新一轮打击，以回应胡塞武装在红海对商船和军用船只的袭击。胡塞武装则声称，他们发动袭击是为了声援巴勒斯坦人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;伊朗及其民兵针对美国在该地区目标的无人机和导弹袭击已持续数年，这是伊朗政府数十年来努力证明自己是一个地区大国的一部分。伊朗政府向哈马斯、伊拉克什叶派民兵、也门胡塞武装、黎巴嫩真主党和敍利亚巴沙尔·阿萨德政府提供军事、后勤和其他援助。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;与此同时，美国每年向以色列提供 38 亿美元的军事援助，向沙特阿拉伯、埃及和其他阿拉伯政权出售武器，并在该地区拥有军事基地，包括在卡塔尔、巴林、科威特、沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合酋长国的基地，以及其他地方小型的前哨基地。2001 年至 2021 年，美军占领了阿富汗。2003 年至 2011 年，美军还占领了伊拉克。俄罗斯也是该地区——包括伊朗、沙特阿拉伯和土耳其在内的——多个国家的主要武器供应国。俄罗斯在敍利亚拥有一个海军基地以及一些地面部队。它还支持伊朗生产导弹和无人机——俄罗斯在入侵乌克兰时使用了其中的一些武器。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;四十多年来，伊朗伊斯兰共和国一直利用反犹太主义及其反对美帝国主义和以色列占领的立场，作为促进其区域帝国主义野心的手段，其中涉及经济、意识形态和战略目标，并导致对该地区工人阶级和被压迫人民的剥削。2018 年，鲁哈尼总统在一次公开演讲中明确表示，伊朗的战略边界是东面的印度次大陆、北面的高加索、南面的红海和西面的地中海。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，在 1979 年伊斯兰共和国成立之前，以色列对巴勒斯坦人民的攻击及其拒绝承认巴勒斯坦人的自决权的行为，已经制造了该地区不断恶化的创伤之一。对巴勒斯坦土地长达 56 年的占领反过来又为该地区的独裁统治者提供了一个外部敌人，用来掩盖每个国家都存在的阶级剥削、父权制、种族主义以及其他形式的偏见和统治等内部矛盾。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在 2011 年「阿拉伯之春」、2011 年的敍利亚起义以及 2019 年苏丹、阿尔及利亚、伊拉克、黎巴嫩和伊朗的抗议浪潮中，世界开始看到中东和北非的民众开始挑战其中的一些内部矛盾。然而，这些努力都遭到了专制政权的镇压。阿萨德政权——残酷镇压了 2011 年的敍利亚起义，其监狱中关押着 10 多万人，有记录表明那里发生了工业规模的酷刑——继续声称其支持巴勒斯坦人，但事实上，它镇压了敍利亚境内捍衞 2011 年起义的巴勒斯坦人。同样声称捍衞巴勒斯坦人自决权的阿拉伯、伊朗和土耳其统治者，却因为库尔德人的自决要求，残酷镇压其国内的库尔德人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2022 年秋天在伊朗兴起的「妇女、生命、自由」运动是整个地区的希望灯塔。抗议数月并被逮捕、杀害、致盲和强奸的妇女和男子不仅要求结束强制性佩戴头巾。他们还要求妇女有权控制自己的身体，有权接受基于批判性思维的教育，结束死刑，被压迫的少数民族的权利和劳工权利。他们反对宗教原教旨主义、性别/国家暴力、军国主义和帝国主义，呼吁与该地区其他国家和平共处。这场运动参与者的各种声明呼吁打破该地区独裁政权所利用的种族、宗教和性别划分。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在 2023 年 10 月获得诺贝尔和平奖的伊朗女权主义人权活动家纳尔吉斯·穆罕默迪（Narges Mohammadi）的不懈努力中，也可以体现「妇女、生命、自由」运动的积极内容。除了美国笔会要求释放她的请愿书之外，西方媒体对她的报道几乎没有，很少有英文报道提到她在狱中发表的关于巴勒斯坦和以色列的声明，该声明谴责「袭击无家可归者、屠杀儿童、妇女和平民、劫持人质、（以及）轰炸医院、学校和居民区。」穆罕默迪呼吁「立即停火，结束战争……尊重人权，为各国人民的和平共处创造条件。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;面对穆罕默迪等女权主义者的持续反抗，监狱、学校和街头青年的反抗，以及工人、教师、护士、少数民族、退休人员和残疾人的反抗，伊朗政府加大了镇压力度。它实施了《头巾和贞洁法》，严厉加重了对没有佩戴「适当头巾」的妇女的惩罚。伊朗处决了更多的库尔德、俾路支和阿拉伯青年，包括在「妇女、生命、自由」抗议活动中被捕的青年。伊朗的死刑率仅次于中国，位居世界第二。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;伊朗监狱内外的持不同政见者轮番绝食以抗议死刑。绝食者、女权主义者和其他持不同政见者给联合国人权事务副高级专员娜达·纳西弗（Nada al-Nashif）撰写公开信，要求她取消伊朗之行，因为她将不被允许会见政治犯和被处决者的家属。她还将被迫戴上头巾。给纳西弗撰写公开信的签名者希望她等待联合国实情调查团关于伊朗政府对「妇女、生命、自由」抗议者实施谋杀和强奸的调查结果。但她却一意孤行，并宣布此行不是探访囚犯及其家属的实情调查团，而是与伊斯兰共和国官员会面的正式行程。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;伊朗国内的进步力量并没有要求西方国家进行正式访问，会见政府领导人，也没有要求美国进行军事干预。他们正在横向联系全球的基层进步力量，在反对军国主义、独裁主义和宗教原教旨主义的斗争中争取道义和物质上的支持。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;鉴于当前的战争动向和美国与伊朗之间的对抗加剧，对于那些反对美帝国主义和以色列对加沙的战争，反对美国在该地区的袭击、要求加沙停火以及并捍衞伊朗正在进行的争取妇女权利和人权斗争的人来说，这一点极为重要。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;伊朗的进步活动家正在努力反对死刑和大规模监禁，捍衞妇女控制自己身体的权利，捍衞库尔德人、俾路支人和阿拉伯少数民族以及宗教少数群体（如伊朗的巴哈伊教徒和阿富汗移民）的权利。他们正在向——那些正在抵抗塔利班和其他宗教原教旨主义势力的——阿富汗妇女伸出援手。他们的工作对于扭转中东的趋势，使其摆脱专制主义和战争至关重要。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;赞同这些目标的美国进步人士可以首先加入释放纳尔吉斯·穆罕默迪和所有政治犯的呼吁。但更广泛地说，他们可以将这些斗争与美国反对性别和国家暴力的运动、反对大规模监禁的监狱废奴运动、争取生育权和堕胎权的运动以及正在进行的反对军国主义的斗争横向联系起来。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;原文链接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://truthout.org/articles/us-left-must-link-with-progressive-forces-in-middle-east-to-stop-regional-war/&quot;&gt;https://truthout.org/articles/us-left-must-link-with-progressive-forces-in-middle-east-to-stop-regional-war/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼狱中被杀│Alexei Navalny killed in prison</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;俄罗斯社会主义运动（Russian Socialist Movement）的声明&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2024 年 2 月 17 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;管同志，译&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/5eafb251-7201-4e38-9d8b-c9a5d308f866.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼在监狱中被杀。联邦监狱部门报告了这位政治家的死亡，但明显他并非自杀，而是被弗拉基米尔·普京杀害的。纳瓦尔尼的反腐败调查和运动动员了数百万俄罗斯人的政治性，并激励了数千名积极社会活动家——其中的许多人并不同意他的政治观点，但相信变革俄罗斯的可能性。 他和他的组织——反腐败基金会——在 2021 年前都能够组织大规模的反普京集会。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;纳瓦尔尼是俄罗斯民粹主义的创始人之一，即使有着其右翼资历，它也倾向于质疑寡头资本主义，引起人们对俄罗斯贫困和不平等的关注，并将普通俄罗斯民众和富到离谱的、通过篡权、腐败、获取公共资金和财产、酷刑、谋杀和战争获取巨额财富的俄罗斯国家统治集团划分开来。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;普京害怕纳瓦尔尼。他的暗杀是一个明确的政治信号，表明普京主义正在进入一个新阶段，已经能够从实际生活中消灭政治对手，甚至可能消灭任何被认为对政权的生存构成威胁的人。这意味着俄罗斯所有政治犯的生命都处于危险之中。我们必然能预见到俄罗斯境内外的暴力升级以及政治活动家更多的「意外」死亡。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;普京嗜血的政权想要通过杀害纳瓦尔尼来削弱俄罗斯反对派的积极性。我们必须反其期望而行之。为了结束独裁统治，我们必须加强团结性和自我组织性。纳瓦尔尼之死是一个政治殉难的例子，它应当是对我们后续的政治行动的激励，而不是对我们的挫败。 我们决不能放弃。杀人犯将会受到惩罚，独裁政权将会被推翻。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;原文链接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/russocmovement/posts/pfbid0Xo7PaiSFvF8X6g6xmDP466USViTV6vW2uSgbuyywG9enFwVwKQ4hg1Le3s5LnEo8l&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/russocmovement/posts/pfbid0Xo7PaiSFvF8X6g6xmDP466USViTV6vW2uSgbuyywG9enFwVwKQ4hg1Le3s5LnEo8l&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>关注非洲的森林│In Africa, focus on the forests</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;﹝法国﹞保罗·马夏尔（Paul Martial）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 年 8 月 1 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;马城　译、日土兀　校&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/77fe572d-b74a-440e-a7f6-cef4d9df6134.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;非洲和其他大陆一样，正面临着森林覆盖率的减少，这是发展出口农业和伐木业扩张的结果，其中大部分活动是非法的。非洲的森林正受到非洲大陆土地加速商业化的威胁。虽然重点往往是中非赤道上的森林，但萨赫勒-撒哈拉地带以下和南部非洲大部分地区的干旱森林面临着更严重的危机。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;非洲森林面临危险&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;在殖民时期，森林以特许形式被开采。在这种制度下，殖民国家将其所有特权转让给私人公司。这些公司种植出口作物，如可可、咖啡、橡胶、棕榈油等，对森林造成损害。当非洲国家获得独立后，这种农业经济模式继续存在。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;结果，几十年来，森林被大量砍伐。科特迪瓦就是一个很好的例子。在 1900 年至 2021 年期间，该国 80% 的森林消失了，主要是由于可可出口。和亚马逊一样，非洲的森林能进行大量的碳封存。刚果森林储存了 500 亿吨碳。它们有助于调节气候，是许多动植物物种的家园。对近 1 亿人来说，它们也是食物、药物和建筑材料的直接或间接来源。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;盗采森林资源非法获利&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;由于森林的市场化，非洲每年有近 400 万公顷的森林消失。这采取了通过政策掠夺土地的形式，使大型跨国公司受益，同时与非洲国家领导人共谋。其目的是发展出口农业和采矿业务。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;另一个加剧森林砍伐的因素是木材贸易。由于亚洲市场的强劲需求，非法采伐呈爆炸式增长。这意味着非洲大陆损失了 170 亿美元。例如，在乌干达，非法砍伐的木材占木材总量的 80%。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;走私的发生离不开政客与高级官员的同谋。2019 年，加蓬林业部长盖伊-伯特兰·马潘古（Guy-Bertrand Mapangou）涉嫌贩运珍贵木材。在赞比亚，与前总统埃德加·伦古（Edgar Lungu）关系密切的人也卷入了类似的事件。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;「对使用者友善」的保护&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;迫于国际压力，非洲各国政府纷纷出台法律措施保护本国森林。但成效甚微，主要是因为缺乏资源，也由于腐败。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这些政策鼓励森林社区参与这种贸易，社区成员更愿意从这笔意外之财中获益，而不是仅仅做一个旁观者。社区所处的不稳定的土地保有情况不鼓励他们从事可持续的林业活动。正如一位社区领袖所说:「这些公司进来，在没有征求我们意见的情况下经营我们的森林，当我们抗议时，他们拿出一份官方文件，声称他们有权这样做。虽然这些森林毫无疑问是属于我们，但是我们无能为力。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;保护森林的最好办法是让它们处于社区的控制之下。这意味着确保他们的土地所有权和尊重他们的生活方式。正如一位土著领袖所说:「我们在森林里生活了几千年，一直在可持续地利用它。」事实上，获得执行的项目清单显示，这些资源正在得到保护，这是科学家们所谓的「愉快保护」的结果。换句话说，人与自然和谐相处，与目前普遍存在的过度开发和掠夺森林资源相去甚远。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;原文链接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article8191&quot;&gt;https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article8191&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.red-publish.com/book/2990&quot;&gt;电子书：《论语漫读》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子曰：「由！诲女知之乎？知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也」&lt;/strong&gt;（为政第二）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/d0bed9ee-224a-436d-9ffb-3ef3d2d10530.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;由，仲由，字子路。鲁国人，孔子早年弟子，名列孔门十哲和七十二贤。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;子路年龄与孔子差得不多，只比孔子小九岁。据史记记载，「子路性鄙，好勇力，志伉直」，还曾向孔子动拳头。但被孔子以礼折服，才拜孔子为师。孔子大约 30 岁左右开始讲学，那么子路拜孔子为师时至少 21 岁了。年纪越大，可塑性就越小。性格很难改变，学习能力可能也不如其他又年轻又聪慧的弟子。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;说来说去，子路爱出头。有什么事情，总是自告奋勇。孔子周游列国的旅途中，都有赖子路当开路先锋；学习中有什么问题，他肯定也憋不住要提出来；或者孔子提问时，他不求甚解，不假思索地就抢先问答。但又没有理解透，结果没答对。不像颜回那样沉得住气，给孔子面子。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;所以，孔子训斥他，「子路呀，我不是告诉过你什么叫知道吗？知道是知道，不知道为不知道，要分得清楚自己知道什么，不知道什么，这才是知道」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;苏格拉底曾说，「我拥有的知识越多,我越觉得无知」。与孔子这句话有些类似。就是知道自己的无知才算是真正的知道。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;通常，孔子的话是学生问，他作答。但这段话，却是孔子劈头盖脸朝子路一通训斥。肯定是惹得孔子很不高兴。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;《论语》中还有两处，孔子直呼子路的名字，同是教训的口吻。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子曰：由，知德者鲜矣！&lt;/strong&gt;（衞灵公第十五）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这句训导与「知之为知之」契合。可能子路自以为知德，但孔子认为他其实并没有真正了解，所以这么训斥他。「仲由呀！这世上知道仁德的人少得可怜！你其实也不知道，不要装着知道，还是老老实实继续跟我学习吧！」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子曰：「由也！女闻六言六蔽矣乎？」对曰：「未也。」「居！吾语女。好仁不好学，其蔽也愚。好知不好学，其蔽也荡。好信不好学，其蔽也贼。好直不好学，其蔽也绞。好勇不好学，其蔽也乱。好刚不好学，其蔽也狂」&lt;/strong&gt;（阳货第十七）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;仁、知、信、直、勇和刚，看来这六者都是子路所好，但孔子却认为子路不怎么好学。所以孔子谆谆教导他不好好学习的话，他追求修炼的品德品质也不会有好效果。「爱好仁德而不爱学习，弊病是容易受人蒙骗；爱好耍聪明而不爱学习，弊病是没有根本；听信他人而不爱学习，弊病是害了自己；性子直率却不爱学习，弊病是说话轻率；喜欢争强好胜却不爱学习，容易目无尊长；为人倔强却不爱学习，弊病是狂妄自大」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但子路有个优点，勇于践行，知行合一。知道了，就立马去做。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子路有闻，未之能行，唯恐有闻&lt;/strong&gt;（公冶长第五）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;子路从孔子那里闻知一个做人的道理后，还未能做到，唯恐再闻知新的道理。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;子路有闻，不言而喻，是从孔子那里闻知做人的道理。或者直接听孔子讲，或听同学转述。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这说明子路对自己要求很高，闻知一个道理后，就急于去做。如果自己做不到，就会产生内心冲突和焦虑。因而惟恐再闻知一个道理，怕自己也做不到，徒增烦恼。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;这是正话反说，「&lt;strong&gt;唯恐有闻」&lt;/strong&gt;似乎批评子路不爱求问，但实际是在赞扬子路非常重视行动，自己认为对的，就一定要去践行，并到达要求。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但&lt;strong&gt;「知之为知之，不知为不知」&lt;/strong&gt;并不意味着要慎于表达。如果什么事情都要考虑周全万无一失无懈可击才说出自己和意见，也不见得可取。通过集体讨论，抛砖引玉和相互启发，集思广益将更有利于认识问题和解决问题。&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>该怎样教？</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;该怎样教？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liqiu Wang 王立秋 &lt;strong&gt;2024-03-16 13:26&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;上个月，亚当·科茨科 (Adam Kotsco) 在&lt;strong&gt;Slate&lt;/strong&gt;上发表了一篇文章，讨论学生读写能力——一个在大学课堂上被视之为当然的东西——的消失。他说一直以来，他为每节课指定的阅读材料大概都在 30 页左右，根据阅读材料的难易程度有所增减。但近年来他发现的一个问题是，超过 10 页的材料就会让学生觉得受不了，要求学生把握一篇 20 页左右的论文中的论证更是变成了不可能完成的任务。在确认这不只是一个个别问题、或自我感觉良好的一代人对下一代人的习惯性抱怨后，他推测，学生读写能力的消失可能有三方面的原因，一是数字技术尤其是手机的普及，尤其是，现在，我们在课堂上面对的是完全在智能手机陪伴下长大的一代人（当然，说的主要是欧美的情况，且暂不考虑数字鸿沟的影响）；二是疫情；三是教学方式，主要体现为以考试-指标化考核为取向的、受某些流行教育理论（如平衡读写理论）影响的教学方式。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我相信这篇文章一定会引起任何扮演过教师角色的人的共鸣和思考（由于作者与 Slate 签了三个月内不得授权其他地方转发的合同，我暂时无法直接译介这篇短文，有兴趣的读者可以到 slate 上搜索「The Loss of Things I Took for Granted」）。它也提醒我注意到了自己一直以来的一个思维盲区：作为一个成天把 relexivity 和反思挂在嘴上的人，在这方面，我却真的只是在「抱怨」和被动地「迎合」、而没有主动地思考「为什么学生不读书」这个问题。然而只要稍加思索就不难发现，这个问题和很多看似与眼下现实联系不那么紧密的问题是相关的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在引申之前，我想简要评述亚当的论述。他提到的第一、二点，在我看来影响不全是负面的，这涉及到关于数字技术/媒介的利弊之争、可供性、对人潜能的限制/激发等的讨论（这里适合引用丹尼尔·米勒的一个论述：「和使用像后人类或跨人类那样的术语相反，我们可以把人定义为一个包含每一种新技术实现的潜在因素的存在」）。当然也就像他指出的那样，这部分多少也是我们无能为力的，我们能争取改变的，是对这个环境、氛围、条件的反应，也就是我们的教学方式。我完全同意他的这个判断，只是想补充指出，看似完全取决于我们的教学方式，本身也有结构的一面。它和测量、指标化、审计、考核是相关的，甚至再进一步加以引申，和数字技术背后的「数字思维」也是相关的（关于与「模拟」相对的「数字」思维模式，参见亚历山大·加洛韦教授为我们编选的数字与模拟专题，这组文章将刊载于《智能社会研究》即将出版的第 6 期，敬请关注）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但在这里先不谈更哲学、更理论、更思想史的那个部分，让我们先来思考一下「学生不读书」的政治经济结构因素。我首先想到的是自读到起就一直放在心里的，子安宣邦关于「学」之复权的讨论。对此，户仓恒信在为《思想史家重读的论语：「学」的复权》（简中版本译作《孔子的学问——日本人如何读〈论语〉》）撰写的书评中做出了很好的引申：「现代教育的偏执是，始终不让学子们积极思考，所谓不参加、不出席、不发表，这些消极行为上才需要其自主性的抉择。很奇妙的是，从幼稚园到研究所，这些机构的主宰者只对于‘能为而为’盲目地加以评分，而不去思考‘能为而不为’里含有的积极意涵。……这种‘学制’的存在已经证明了，学子们对于这活动感受不到‘学’的存在」(p. 287)。当「教」被固化、吸纳为体制架构的一部分，旨在灌输均一化的「正确」的时候，「学」就变成了名义上正确但事实上不被鼓励的抵抗。事实上，真正对系统内教育有所体会的人也清楚，这个名义上被鼓励的行动，也被鼓励只停留在表面上——你最好表演学，而不要真的去学。（相应的，你最好表演教，而不是真去教似乎早就是文化的一部分了，参见徐浩峰的各种电影。）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但是什么刺破了相互配合的泡沫，使学生不通过学的抵抗去摆脱学的表象，而是转向懒惰/摆烂/冷漠/不配合/不理会/不回应/不在乎的态度呢？事实上，这种不配合背后有一种寂静的绝望。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;马克·费舍《资本主义现实主义》中的《反身性无能与止动》一章，对这个现象做出了敏锐的诊断。「这种听天由命既不是冷漠也不是犬儒，而是反身性无能。他们知道情况不妙，但更重要的是，他们知道自己对此无能为力。」这在某种程度上是一种对无比强大的现实、结构采取了一种怠惰的态度，就费舍观察到的英国学生而言，这种态度促使学生们转向了一种「抑郁的快乐」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但我们这里不一样，毕竟，与在实际教学互动中遭遇的「消极」相反，事实上，我们的学生似乎更加「积极」的「卷」起来了。说到底，规训结构的转变仿佛更多地激发了学生们的新自由主义主体性。「学」被抛弃了看起来仅仅是因为它「无用」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;的确，如果要学习怎样混学界，抛弃课堂直接去接受大缸式的学术公务员培训不好吗？如果要满足考核指标，以比课堂高效的方式速成不好吗？如果要占有知识，直接购买不好吗？如果一定要接受灌输，B 站不好么？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;于是这似乎又回到了课堂上应该提供什么的问题，在明面上的功能失效并已经可以彻底被各种「黑市」取代的情况下，课堂还能提供什么其他地方没有的东西？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;也许是某种无法被指标化、被显性化、被捕捉的东西。在我看来，那就是学，而如果学不能被以主动的、积极的方式教授的话，那么，课堂能提供的，至少是「学」的示范——教育者不能只表演教，也必须展示学——至多则是对「学」的亲历，在一定程度上让学生去亲历学习，亲历阅读、理解、思考、分析的过程。&lt;/p&gt;
