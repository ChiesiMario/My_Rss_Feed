            <title>微故事: 如迷宮的大宅 (東加豆)</title>
            <description>&lt;h2&gt;微故事: 如迷宮的大宅 (東加豆)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/bfc83115-d07a-4561-bd2d-37195a81ed99.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;這是一座｛如城堡的大宅｝。阿紅求得了這份｛清潔工｝之後，她每天就在這裡進出進入。其實阿紅不用工作的，以她現在的積蓄是足夠過她的退休生活。不過，這裡的人都認為，這家人是全城鎮最富有的。富有到這樣真叫人好奇，人們未必會羨慕他們，但總會有好奇心。就像王室裡的成員一樣，那些生活是不會讓人嚮往的，但那種不尋常的視物卻引人好奇和疑惑。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿紅每天清晨，當第一道陽光照進來的時候，她便會踏上前往大宅的路，她擁有了自由穿梭於這座城堡的權利。雖然只不過是一個｛清潔工｝，或者説阿紅只是一個清潔工。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;起初，她只是默默地掃地、擦窗，盡量不去打擾這座大宅的寧靜。但隨著日子一天天過去，她開始注意到一些不尋常的細節。走廊的盡頭總是有風吹過，而那裡明明沒有開窗。樓梯轉角處有幾幅壁畫，那些抽象畫讓人難以理解，不似人也不似動物，不似風景也不似食物，而且每次經過都似乎會有些變化。不僅阿紅覺得這樣，花王和洗熨工也這樣説的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;漸漸，她覺得這座宅大得離譜，東南西北面也有建築物一路延伸，用迷宮來形容它絕不誇張。管家説這個家庭有五十個人，但阿紅卻沒有見多過十個人，他們進出門時間不同，吃飯時間、起牀和晚睡的時間也不一樣，原來兩年前大老爺死了之後就變成這樣。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿紅她被那錯綜複雜的走廊迷惑，每扇門後似乎都隱藏著不為人知的祕密，她很想知道門裡住著一個什麼樣的人，大宅住了那麼多人，怎麼連五個人也不會走在一起？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿紅在抹擦古董和打掃無盡房間的過程中，她發現這裡的每一塊地磚，每一扇雕花窗戶，都彷彿訴説著沉默的故事。這座大宅寧靜得叫人可怕！最熱鬧就是傭人聚集的地方。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;有一天，阿紅無意中發現了一間封閉許久的圖書室，她心情帶著幾分驚喜和興奮。塵封的書籍堆疊成山，她輕手輕腳地在其中漫遊，彷彿每一本書都是一個世界，等著她去探索。阿紅是愛書之人，愛閲讀，愛寫字。但從她的外表是看不出來的，因為她是婦孺，婦孺和識字彷彿是不相關的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;她發現了一本厚重皮革封面的日記，她帶著冒險和偷窺的心情，坐在地上的毛氈，她把身子捲縮起來，讀到了墨中人的心聲。關於家族、財富以及孤獨和自由的迷思。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;隨著日子一天天過去，阿紅與其他工人和居住者產生了微妙的互動。她注意到管家眼中的高傲背後，隱藏著對這份工作的無比自豪，而那些匆匆走過的家人們臉上的笑容背後，則是彼此之間看不見的疏遠和算計。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一晚的深夜，阿紅在大宅深處聽到了微弱的鋼琴旋律。她追隨著音符的線索，找到了一間密室，裡面坐著那位少爺，他的手指在琴鍵上靈活躍動，他眼神充滿了寂寞，深不見底的寂寞就是這種人。在那刻，阿紅突然明白了，這座大宅中的每個人都在上演自己的獨角戲。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;皮革封面的日記原來不僅只有一本，阿紅發現了十多本，半年裡她已經看了好幾本，可是她無法知道墨中人是誰，也無法知道是男還是女寫的。這個圖書室裡的東西通通都是遺物，所有書籍的物主已經死去了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿紅從日記裡發現了很多，墨中人寫盡了家族人生的悲哀！以及荒唐和淫亂的事情，諷刺的事，不僅家族的人是這樣，大宅裡的傭人都一樣。阿紅手裡握著這本日記，她知道她會繼續看下去的，她知道她越看得多，就會明白為什麼他們一個個都躲起來...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;完&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;寫作日期：2024 年 3 月 27 日&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;開始時間 : 11:15am&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;完結時間 : 15:47pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;圖.文. 東加豆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;相關故事:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://matters.news/@tonkabean/343497-%E5%A6%82%E5%9F%8E%E5%A0%A1%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%A7%E5%AE%85-%E5%9C%96-%E6%96%87-%E6%9D%B1%E5%8A%A0%E8%B1%86&quot;&gt;https://matters.news/@tonkabean/343497-如城堡的大宅-圖-文-東加豆&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;我除了寫微故事，還製作有聲書，希望我們能互相認識。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;喜歡我的文章嗎？盼得到您的支持、點讚，或分享我的文章，讓我知道創作的路上有你陪伴。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E8%88%87%E9%BC%93%E5%8B%B5/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/支持與鼓勵/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;關於我：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;故事選集&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://matters.town/@tonkabean/collections&quot;&gt;https://matters.town/@tonkabean/collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFT 收集&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://liker.land/zh-Hant/like1cdavnkhzj8wsaeafmyqctrs9952q4hgk6tpael?tab=created&quot;&gt;https://liker.land/zh-Hant/like1cdavnkhzj8wsaeafmyqctrs9952q4hgk6tpael?tab=created&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;東加豆貼文生活 What&#39;s App Channel~~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;你的追蹤, 就是我的動力.

            <title>Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit to the mainland: a valuable attempt to ease tensions in the Taiwan Strait</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; According to media reports, Ma Ying-jeou, the former leader of Taiwan (former President of the Republic of China), will visit the Mainland in April 2024, traveling to Xi&#39;an, Guangzhou and Beijing to participate in a series of activities, and may also meet with Xi Jinping, President of China and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The author had written an opinion piece commenting and praising Mr. Ma&#39;s visit to the mainland at the end of March last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The author continues to hold the same view on the latest visit to take place. Cross-Strait relations have deteriorated even more in recent year, and the recent Kinmen ship collision and subsequent clashes have emphasized the importance of cross-Strait exchanges and maintaining peace. The author also releases this article again in the hope that more people will understand the motivation and impact of Ma&#39;s visit to the mainland and promote the peaceful development of both sides of the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The following content is the original text)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 27, 2023, former leader of Taiwan (former President of the Republic of China) Ma Ying-jeou arrived in Nanjing, initiating his trip to mainland China under the guise of &quot;ancestral worship.&quot; Ma Ying-jeou is the first former president of Taiwan to visit the mainland, carrying significant symbolic weight and sparking widespread international attention and intense controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months, with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the formation and confrontation of the two major camps in the world (those supporting Ukraine&#39;s liberal democratic camp and those pro-Russia authoritarian camp), tensions in the Taiwan Strait have been escalating. Speculation about the possibility of mainland China using force against Taiwan has been rife, with various countries in the US, Japan, and Europe intervening in the Taiwan issue in different ways, leading to increasing tensions in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In such a situation, Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit to the mainland with a delegation composed of many young students has sparked even more controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, where anti-Communist and anti-mainland sentiments have dominated public opinion in recent years, most Taiwanese naturally hold a critical attitude towards Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit. They believe that, in the current highly confrontational situation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit to the mainland constitutes an act of &quot;selling out&quot; and &quot;surrender,&quot; undermining the morale of Taiwanese people who &quot;resist China and protect Taiwan.&quot; Some commentators also believe that Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit amounts to presenting a &quot;united front gift&quot; to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which could be used and flaunted by the CCP to further infiltrate and eventually occupy Taiwan. Some commentators even resort to personal attacks, alleging that Ma Ying-jeou is paving the way for personal gain, seeking &quot;rewards&quot; from the CCP, and aiming for a semi-official position under CCP rule after Taiwan falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are voices expressing understanding and appreciation for Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit to the mainland, but they are relatively few, mainly coming from Chinese officials and some Western individuals. Only a few members of the Kuomintang (KMT) in Taiwan have expressed support for this former president and party chairman. Overall, criticism outweighs praise. Among Chinese political opposition figures, criticism of Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit to the mainland is almost unanimous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a political opposition member myself, I have a relatively different assessment and hold a rather positive view of Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit to the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always had a favorable impression of Mr. Ma Ying-jeou. This is not only because his political stance aligns with mine, but also because Mr. Ma&#39;s character and morals are worthy of respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Ma Ying-jeou was one of the few political figures in Taiwan who had a strong sense of Chinese national identity, full of national sentiment, genuinely cared about mainland China and its people, and deeply hoped for the country to achieve democratic reunification. During Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s presidency, the concept of &quot;cross-strait kinship&quot; was implemented in various fields such as economy, culture, and society, leading to unprecedented closeness and friendliness between the people on both sides of the strait. Although there were still political tensions, they were able to &quot;set aside disputes and seek common development&quot; to a large extent, and the level of peace in the Taiwan Strait and cross-strait cooperation reached a historical peak during Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ma Ying-jeou also cared deeply about human rights, cultural education, and social livelihood in the mainland. Every year on the anniversary of the June 4th Incident, Mr. Ma would publish articles or posts expressing condolences to the students and people who died in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and emphasizing the necessity and importance of China&#39;s democratization. He also placed considerable importance on the education and growth of the younger generation in China and promoted exchanges and interactions between young people on both sides of the strait. During his presidency, various policies were introduced to facilitate mainland students studying in Taiwan, and cooperation between educational institutions in Taiwan and the mainland was promoted. This has greatly contributed to mutual understanding between people on both sides of the strait, especially among young people, and to the harmonious and friendly relations between the future generations of mainlanders and Taiwanese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his presidency, Ma Ying-jeou also issued a commendation to the Chinese-American writer Iris Chang, praising her for dedicating her life to writing &quot;The Rape of Nanking,&quot; which raised awareness and understanding of the Nanjing Massacre among people worldwide. This reflects Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s love for the Chinese nation, his concern for the tragic history of the mainland, and his commendation and remembrance of those who have contributed to the Chinese nation within his capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s active decades in Taiwan, whether as Chiang Ching-kuo&#39;s secretary, later as president, or as a civilian after stepping down from leadership, he maintained excellent moral qualities and noble character. Compared to other Taiwanese politicians plagued by scandals, Ma Ying-jeou is one of the few politicians with almost no blemishes, known for his integrity, approachability, and elegant speech. He can be considered a perfect man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Ma Ying-jeou is a person who sincerely loves the Chinese nation, genuinely hopes for democratic reunification of China, and possesses high moral character. Such a person would not sell himself out or kneel before others for fame and fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ma Ying-jeou chose the current timing to visit the mainland in the hope of making the utmost effort to promote cross-strait peace and exchanges, reduce unnecessary hostility and miscalculations, and defuse another Taiwan Strait crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this visit, Ma Ying-jeou repeatedly reminded the Tsai Ing-wen government in Taiwan to avoid escalating conflicts with the mainland as much as possible. However, in the tense cross-strait relations and the firm &quot;resist China and protect Taiwan&quot; policy of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government, Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s appeals had little effect. Nevertheless, Ma Ying-jeou has not given up on advocating for peace. His decision to visit the mainland this time was made after careful consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the first former Taiwanese leader to visit the mainland, Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit should have been of extraordinary significance and deserved a grand reception. However, upon his arrival in Nanjing on the 27th, he was only welcomed by a deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and the welcoming ceremony was quite simple, indicating a lack of enthusiasm from mainland China towards Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit. This reflects the awkward position Ma Ying-jeou finds himself in, trying to please both sides. However, this was likely something Ma Ying-jeou anticipated before his visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Ma Ying-jeou resolutely embarked on his journey to the mainland, further proving his sincere commitment to promoting cross-strait peace and exchanges, regardless of personal gain or loss. His decision to lead dozens of young students to the mainland also reflects his consistent emphasis on education, nurturing new talents, and promoting exchanges between young people on both sides of the strait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, in the current context of the Taiwan Strait and international situation, as well as the relatively unfavorable political climate on both sides of the strait, Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit is unlikely to change the reality and will have a very limited impact. However, it makes Ma Ying-jeou&#39;s visit even more rare and valuable, reflecting that even in the current precarious cross-strait and international situation, there are still people trying to facilitate communication and easing tensions to cool down the situation. This is not easy and deserves respect and appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a writer from mainland China, I, like Ma Ying-jeou, also support the reunification of both sides based on democracy. Of course, regardless of the system, national reunification should respect the will of the majority of people on both sides, and should not be achieved through force. If war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, it will only bring suffering to the people and is entirely unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan, although upholding freedom and democracy, does not care about the people of mainland China and has no intention of promoting democracy in mainland China. They only hope to maintain the status quo of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. This is a narrow-minded stance. Moreover, if the mainland remains under CCP dictatorship, with its people brainwashed and manipulated, true peace in the Taiwan Strait is unlikely, and democratic Taiwan will always face the threat of authoritarian China under the CCP. Therefore, only when mainland China also achieves democracy, with both sides adhering to universal values, can peace be truly enduring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author hopes that Taiwan will have more people who, like Mr. Ma Ying-jeou, firmly believe in the universal values of freedom and democracy while also caring for mainland compatriots and being concerned about the suffering of over a billion people on the more than 9 million square kilometers of territory still nominally part of the Republic of China. They should strive to promote democratization and political pluralism throughout China, achieve the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, promote peace in the Asia-Pacific region, and contribute to global prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h2&gt;微故事: 藝術家的鬱金香 (東加豆)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/938399df-e493-4f16-bfe5-8beaad9f6040.jpeg/public&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;AI&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;這幅｛凋謝中的鬱金香｝充滿了悲涼與哀愁。鬱金香裡藏著了憂鬱，每一朵讓人難過，阿李索性每一天都來這裡，把一朵朵的鬱金香畫下來，畫完一幅又一幅，然後放到朋友的畫廊，等待買家發現，即使結果是廉價。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;出人意料的是，｛凋謝中的鬱金香｝居然有人高價買了它，然後更高價出售它，這舉動引起人們的關注，阿李的名字漸漸出傳遍了藝術圈。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因為｛凋謝中的鬱金香｝的價值不菲，讓其它鬱金香畫布的價值也翻了幾番，阿李那一年幾乎每天都在畫鬱金香，他畫二百多幅畫，自己也收藏了幾十幅鬱金香畫布，鬱金香畫布更成為了上流社會討論的話題。這種現像變得瘋狂，並發展變成一個｛鬱金香時代｝。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/90ddb934-9e3f-4d5a-8fa2-eb2fe1cdec80.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;拍攝:泳友-阿伍-Simon Ng&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛阿林｝和｛阿馬｝見狀，紛紛以鬱金香為題材，創作出自己的作品。阿林的音樂如泣如訴，旋律就像哀傷和哭泣，點點的音符藏朵朵的鬱金香裡。｛阿林｝看著｛阿李｝的畫布啟發了他無限的靈感，寫了許多的作品。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛阿馬｝的故事則以快樂和諧感人為主題，他不想再要悲傷難過，人生已經太多難過了！快樂的故事一個個接踵而來。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一時間，家族的鬱金香成了藝術的象徵，三人也因此在當代的藝術家排行榜上赫然有名。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因為｛鬱金香｝有很好的交換條件，它能為他們找回了很多的資源，孩子可喝奶，病可看醫生，肚餓有食物，寒冬有暖衣，一個個的傭人先後回來了，一個個妻子抱著孩子回家，還可以買她們喜愛的珠寶首飾。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/c592052d-e0c6-4980-9aba-9603d8240724.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;拍攝:泳友-阿伍-Simon Ng&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，再光輝都會有黯淡時候，任何風潮都會過去的。｛鬱金香時代｝只維持了三年，人們的目光不再聚焦在｛鬱金香｝了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;令人難過的是，人生的起跌卻沒有改變了他們。鬱金香再次凋謝，鬱金香花園再次變得凋零不堪。看著這種困境還是視而不見，他們並不在乎再次失去任資源，因為，只有視而不見才能繼續他們的夢境...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/8d7cb558-4264-4365-ade4-e8626d9600ee.jpeg/public&quot;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;莫斯科郊外音樂廳的恐怖襲擊至今已造成 140 多人死亡，隨着坍塌建築的清理，估計這個數字還會繼續上升。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在對這一事件感到震驚的同時，人們也看到了十分荒謬的一幕。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISIS 在恐襲發生後第一時間發表聲明稱對此次襲擊負責，但普京的反應是：該死的烏克蘭人！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISIS 又是發佈照片、又是發佈恐怖分子現場拍攝的視頻，拼命證明這是他們乾的。而俄羅斯當局則通過迅速發佈所逮捕的恐怖分子抓捕以及刑訊視頻，努力將烏克蘭和此次恐怖襲擊事件聯繫起來。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISIS 和俄羅斯當局好像正在進行一場極限拉扯：ISIS 竭盡全力想讓人們相信這次恐怖襲擊是他們乾的，俄羅斯當局則一心要讓人們相信烏克蘭人參與了這次恐怖襲擊。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISIS 為什麼生怕別人不知道、不相信這是他們乾的？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因為這是 ISIS 難得的宣傳機會。它需要通過這種恐怖襲擊向其支持者們宣示它依然存在、它仍能行動、它仍然值得資助甚至加入。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;單單是 2024 年，ISIS 已經認領了以下恐怖襲擊事件：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 月 3 日，伊朗蘇萊曼尼被殺 4 週年紀念儀式爆炸案，94 死，284 傷；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 月 6 日，阿富汗汽車爆炸案，5 死，15 傷；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 月 9 日，阿富汗汽車爆炸案，3 死，4 傷；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 月 28 日，土耳其教堂槍擊案，1 死，1 傷；&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 月 30 日，巴基斯坦爆炸案，4 死，5 傷；&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 月 7 日，巴基斯坦爆炸案，30 死，數十傷；&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 月 9 日，莫桑比克恐襲案，至少 26 死；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 月 21 日，阿富汗自殺式爆炸案，21 死，至少 50 傷；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISIS 的前身是伊拉克境內的一個武裝團體。它的意識形態是遜尼派極端伊斯蘭，既反美，也反俄，同時也反對伊朗所代表的什葉派——這也是哈馬斯站出來譴責 ISIS 的緣由所在。2014 年，這個武裝團體利用敍利亞內戰突然崛起，侵佔了敍利亞東部大片領土，從而在 2015 年建立起了一個橫跨敍利亞和伊拉克、轄有 1200 多萬人口的伊斯蘭國（全名是伊拉克和敍利亞伊斯蘭國 Islam State of Iraq and Syria，縮寫為 ISIS）。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在它極盛時期，許多國家的公民自願加入了 ISIS，媒體上最常見到的故事是英國女孩跑去中東加入 ISIS。根據 2018 年的一份統計，總共有 860 名英國人加入了 ISIS，而 ISIS 中外籍兵員的最大來源國是俄羅斯，達到 5000 人。因為 ISIS 的極端暴虐和極具威脅性，它遭到了世界各國的聯合絞殺，領頭的國家便是美國和俄羅斯。目前 ISIS 所控制的領土已經極其有限，然而它在中南亞以及非洲仍然有諸多分支，在世界各地的穆斯林團體當中也仍然具有一定影響力。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISIS 和俄羅斯之間的敵對卻要追溯到更早時期。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;蘇聯建立後不久，車臣和印古什都被併入。但在二戰時，印古什和車臣這兩個地方的穆斯林曾和德軍一起跟蘇聯軍隊為敵。於是斯大林便將大批印古什人和車臣人強制遷移到了哈薩克斯坦等中亞地區。成千上萬人在此過程中死亡，在印古什和車臣人的記憶當中，這是一次民族大災難、也是蘇聯對他們進行的一次種族滅絕。2004 年，歐洲議會曾通過一次決議認定蘇聯在此事件中犯下種族滅絕罪。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;蘇聯解體後，車臣一度獨立。但俄羅斯分別於 1994 年和 1999 年兩次發動車臣戰爭，最終使得車臣成為了俄羅斯聯邦的一個加盟共和國。車臣人針對俄羅斯的恐怖襲擊頻頻發生。ISIS 崛起後，俄羅斯聯邦內的許多穆斯林選擇加入，其中大半便是來自車臣。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;俄羅斯當局為什麼迅速認定烏克蘭參與其中？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因為形勢需要。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;俄羅斯當局現在需要的是俄羅斯人民爆發出對烏克蘭的刻骨仇恨。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;教人去愛是很難的，但是教人仇恨卻極其容易。而心中充滿仇恨的人最好操縱。一旦心中充滿了仇恨，理智便不怎麼起作用了，當局就可以對他們如臂使指、指哪打哪。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;只要認定恐襲案與烏克蘭人有關，不管有沒有證據，重複得次數多了，總能激起許多俄羅斯人的憤慨。而這些憤怒的俄羅斯人又會壓制敢於任何表示異議的俄羅斯人——質疑當局的結論就是為烏克蘭辯護，而為烏克蘭辯護豈不就是叛國，叛國者説的話還能有道理？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;如此一來，在俄羅斯國內，對烏克蘭發動的戰爭就顯得越發正義了，進一步擴大徵兵範圍的阻力也就小了，對普京的不滿也被對烏克蘭的仇恨掩蓋了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這種方法，普京應該是使用得十分得心應手了。早在 1999 年，剛剛被任命為總理的普京就利用莫斯科公寓連環爆炸案發動了第二次車臣戰爭，從而一舉奠定了自己在俄羅斯人心目中的「超級硬漢」形象。之後 2002 年莫斯科劇院和 2004 年別斯蘭學校兩起人質事件，都一再加強了其強硬形象，雖然代價是分別 130 多人質和 330 多人質的死亡。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這次恐怖襲擊到底是誰幹的？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;目前能做的判斷是：烏克蘭人的可能性最小，俄羅斯當局自導自演的可能性也很小，ISIS 的可能性最大。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因為發動這樣的恐怖襲擊對烏克蘭來講沒有任何意義，也沒有任何好處，只會讓歐美皺眉、普京暗自心喜。歐美各國是絕對不會支持烏克蘭人幹出這種事的，如果知道是烏克蘭人所為只會減少對烏克蘭的支持。而這類恐怖襲擊不但無法打擊俄軍的士氣，只會讓俄羅斯人更加團結在普京周圍。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;當然，恐怖襲擊的發生對普京來講是有好、有壞。壞的一面是難免有人質疑他對烏克蘭發動的戰爭削弱了對國內安全的保障，好的一面是在恐懼當中，俄羅斯人總是傾向於投入強者的懷抱；而且在仇恨當中，人們會更加支持對烏克蘭的戰爭。顯然，後者發生的概率要遠大於前者。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;網絡上有個寓言，老地主臨終前問他兒子：「豬抱怨飼料差，牛抱怨活太重，雞抱怨雞窩太髒，怎麼辦？」兒子説：「喂好飼料，活輕點，清理雞窩。」老地主搖搖頭説：「你啥都別做，就只告訴他們説，外面有狼。」事實上，更絕的手段是控制防護欄損壞的時機，當抱怨聲大的時候就放任狼進來咬死一批。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;俄羅斯當局根本不需要自導自演，只需要放鬆警戒、讓恐怖分子輕鬆得手、事先圈定合適的替罪羊就成。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;所以這個音樂廳一年前還舉行過反恐演習，但是這一次卻讓恐怖分子如入無人之境；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;所以音樂廳附近就是特種部隊，但是特種部隊卻姍姍來遲；&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;所以一方面 ISIS 稱襲擊者已成功逃出，另一方面俄羅斯卻迅速宣佈已經抓捕了 11 名嫌疑人包括 4 名襲擊者，並放出刑訊視頻。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>論語漫讀（38）：大車無輗，小車無軏 — 為政就如駕車</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.red-publish.com/book/2990&quot;&gt;電子書：《論語漫讀》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子曰：「人而無信，不知其可也。大車無輗，小車無軏，其何以行之哉？」&lt;/strong&gt;（為政第二）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/4a5be5b4-1e24-4893-9d39-337d18303a56.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;「人而無信，不知其可也」。歷來多解釋為：「一個人如果沒有信用，不知道他還可以做什麼？」但這樣解釋，與後面的比喻合不上。「大車」是牛車，拉重物，相當於現在的貨車，故稱大車；「小車」是馬車，載人的，相當於現在的小車。「輗」和「軏」分別是牛車和馬車的一個部件。具體長什麼樣，無關緊要，只需要知道是將馬和牛與車體連接起來連接件就行了，就相當於現在汽車的傳動裝置。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;孔子將「信」比喻為車上的連接件，「人而無信」就如車無輗軏無法行駛，什麼也幹不了。所以這裏將「信」解釋為「信任」，比「誠信」、「信用」合理些，「人」也不是指單個的人，而是指「人們」，指一個羣體，其中有拉車的，也有駕車坐車的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;整段話的意思是，「人們相互之間沒有信任，不知道他們可以幹什麼。就如大車無輗，小車無軏，車如何可以行駛呢？」這很明顯是在解釋為政，所以才列入為政篇。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;結合到顏淵第十二篇中一段，可以相互印證。&lt;strong&gt;子貢問政。子曰：「足食，足兵，民信之矣。」子貢曰：「必不得已而去，於斯三者何先？」曰：「去兵。」子貢曰：「必不得已而去，於期二者何先？」曰：「去食。自古皆有死，民無信不立。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這裏，孔子提出了保證統治的三大要素，分別是足食，足兵和民信之，「之」指統治者或統治者的政策政令。用現代話語來説，就是為民眾提供物質保障、安全保障和得到民眾的信任。食品是維持生存的基本物質保障，軍隊用於提供安全保障，民眾信任才能得到他們的響應和支持。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但孔子認為民眾的信任對保證統治最重要，必不得已，其它二者都可捨棄。食物匱乏，很多人就會餓死。但孔子認為自古以來，人總是要死的，餓死也是死。只是早死和晚死之分。只要民眾保持對統治的信任，即使物質和安全匱乏，也能保住統治地位。「民無信不立」，並不是説民眾不講信用，民眾就無法立身；而是説如果民眾沒有對統治者的信任，則統治者無法保住統治。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這裏有個問題。如果統治者無法為民眾提供物質和安全保障，又怎麼能得到民眾的信任呢？唯一的解釋就只能是道德説教和洗腦。這用儒家思想是解釋得通的，儒家提倡忠孝，用忠孝綁架民眾，讓老百姓視統治者為父母，即使挨餓受凍，被搶被害，也要保持對統治者的忠誠。所謂「餓死事小，失節事大」，「犬不擇家貧，子不嫌母醜」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;回到「人而無信」，就能發現其含義主要是指民眾對統治者的信任。就如牛和馬要聽駕車者指揮才能行駛。當然，駕車者也需要相信牛和馬能載得動或能跨越障礙才行。為政就如駕車，老百姓是牛馬，而統治者是駕車者。&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>法國新反對資本主義黨關於參加即將進行的歐洲議會選舉的聲明│C’est officiel, le NPA sera bien présent aux élections européennes !</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;2024 年 2 月 26 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;譯者：馬由冰&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/d3badc83-d28f-44a3-9edb-8d7a5795b95b.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;幾個月來，我們一直在強調我們參加 2024 年 6 月 9 日歐洲議會選舉的決心，這將決定明年春天的政治局勢。現在，在經由集體的力量籌集到了實現這一願景所需的財政和政治資源後，我們的計劃正在堅實地推進當中。我們的名單將由來自公共和私營部門的男女工人、學生和青年僱員組成，他們不僅代表了我們國家的各個地區，也展現了我們黨及其青年組織的活力。在法國新反對資本主義黨（NPA）第五次代表大會召開一年半之後，我們將在這次選舉中代表共產主義、革命和國際主義政治潮流的連續性，對他們來説，選舉不會改變生活，但提供了在更大範圍內宣傳結束資本主義的迫切需要的機會。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在這片大陸上，絕大多數人僅能依靠被通貨膨脹破壞的工資、養老金和福利金生存，而大資本主義集團，尤其是那些將人民的鮮血轉化為數以十億計的利潤的資本主義集團，卻在大快朵頤，我們名單上的候選人將成為被剝削和被壓迫者憤怒和鬥爭的代言人。它將捍衞歐洲大陸所有工人為贏得有尊嚴的生活而鬥爭的團結的必要性：每個人多拿 400 歐元，收入不得低於 2000 歐元！它將堅決反對所有為資產階級服務的政黨幾十年來一直在幫助建立的、對其它大陸的男男女女佈滿圍牆和鐵絲網的歐洲「堡壘」。右翼運動，種族主義、民族主義、性別歧視和恐同症的入侵，並不是工人階級對其日益加劇的困難的自發反應：它是由佔統治地位的階級通過那些在整個歐洲以他們的名義執政的人推動和培育的，無論他們被稱為梅洛尼、歐爾班還是馬克龍。我們捍衞開放邊界，捍衞所有人的遷徙和定居自由。打倒極右翼，打倒所有為他們的仇外和反社會政策鋪平道路的人！最後，我們將主張，應該由那些生產社會所有財富的勞動者來決定自己的命運、全人類的命運和地球的命運。是時候建立另一個沒有貧困、剝削和壓迫的社會了。為了實現這一目標，對於那些適應了以少數寄生蟲佔有共同財產和資源為基礎的階級分化社會的任何機構或政治力量，我們都不會寄予任何信任。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這場運動將完全獨立於體制左派和改良主義左派，特別是「不屈法國」（France insoumise）[1]，因為它所捍衞的是一個與資本主義的維持相適應的方案。我們本希望這場運動能由各種極左翼思潮共同發起，我們也為此與工人鬥爭黨（Lutte Ouvrière）進行了接觸，但他們拒絕了我們的提議。我們歡迎任何贊同我們所捍衞的綱領的人給予支持。我們的運動發言人塞爾瑪·拉比布（Selma Labib）、加埃爾·基蘭特（Gaël Quirante）、阿爾梅勒·佩爾圖斯（Armelle Pertus）和達米安·斯卡利（Damien Scali）已經準備好迴應任何請求，並即將在全國各地舉行一系列公開會議。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;巴黎，2024 年 2 月 26 日。法國新反對資本主義黨（NPA）新聞稿&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1]由讓-呂克·梅朗雄組建的左翼政黨&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;原文鏈接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://nouveaupartianticapitaliste.fr/communique-cest-officiel-le-npa-sera-bien-present-aux-elections-europeennes/&quot;&gt;https://nouveaupartianticapitaliste.fr/communique-cest-officiel-le-npa-sera-bien-present-aux-elections-europeennes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>時間站在哪一邊——台海危機的現狀與展望</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（1）賴清德勝選，兩岸關係會否生變？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;台灣總統大選落幕，民進黨賴清德獲勝。眼下各方最關心的問題是：賴清德接任台灣總統，兩岸關係將會發生哪些改變？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;正像我先前講過的，賴清德當選總統，兩岸關係不會發生重大改變，中共不會對台灣動武。因為賴清德明確表示在兩岸問題上他將維持現狀，不會搞台獨。順便説明，什麼是中共定義的台獨？很簡單，那就是修改中華民國憲法，把「大陸地區屬於中華民國」這句話拿掉。但既然賴清德宣稱他將遵循中華民國憲法，不會修憲，因此中共就不會對台灣動武。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;但是小的改變是會有的。因為賴清德本來就比蔡英文更綠。在勝選感言中，賴清德不把台灣叫作中華民國而叫作「中華民國台灣」，把大陸稱為「中國」，這在中共看來都暗含着很強的台獨色彩。所以大陸必定會做出一系列動作向賴清德施加壓力。事實上，因為中共也預估賴清德很可能勝選，因此早在去年 12 月就開始施壓， 宣佈中止《海峽兩岸經濟合作框架協議》(ECFA) 下 12 個類別產品的關稅減讓措施；在投票前兩天，中共當局又宣佈準備進一步中止早期收穫農漁、機械、汽車零配件、紡織等產品關稅減讓措施。就在台灣大選揭，曉的第二天，南太平洋島國瑙魯就宣佈同台灣斷交，使得台灣僅有的 12 個邦交國又少了一個。凡此種種，都表明中共向賴清德施加壓力。類似的動作，中共還可能繼續採取。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;去年 11 月，美國《外交事務》（Foreign Affairs）雜誌刊出美國學者葛來儀（Bonnie Glaser)、白潔曦 (JessicaChen Weiss) 和柯慶生 (Thomas Christensen) 的文章。文章説，要遏阻中共在台海動武，美國單靠軍事威脅是不夠的，美國必須在做出懲罰威脅的同時，再提供北京「可信的再保證」 (credible reassurances)，而為了讓這種「再保證」有效發揮作用，他們建議民進黨總統候選人賴清德一旦勝選，應考慮凍結台獨黨綱。假如賴清德凍結了台獨黨綱，中共方面也會做出一些迴應。例如，不再繼續挖走台灣的邦交國，重新開放大陸的自由行和團客訪台，恢復《海峽兩岸經濟合作框架協議》（ECFA）的若干措施，等等。但是因為賴清德很可能會像蔡英文一樣，拒絕承認九二共識，拒絕直接説出大陸地區與台灣地區同屬中華民國這句話，也就是兩岸一中，海協會與台灣海基會的互動仍然不會恢復。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;前面説到，賴清德不會修改憲法，因此中共不會對台動武。但這決不是説，只要台灣不獨，大陸就一定不武。中共國家安全部在 1 月 16 日發文，提到中共在 2005 年通過的《反分裂國家法》。《反分裂國家法》明確規定了對台動武的 3 種情形：1、「台獨」分裂勢力以任何名義、任何方式造成台灣從中國分裂出去的事實；2、導致台灣從中國分裂出去的重大事變；3、和平統一的可能性完全喪失。注意這第 3 種情形，這就是説，哪怕台獨勢力沒有以任何名義、任何方式造成台灣從中國分裂出去的事實，哪怕沒有發生任何導致台灣從中國分裂出去的重大事變，只要中共當局自己主觀認定和平統一的可能性完全喪失，它就可以對台灣動用武力。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;按照這一條，既然多次民調都表明台灣民眾不分藍綠都拒絕中共提出的「一國兩制、和平統一」方案，尤其是多次民調都顯示大部分台灣人只認同自己是台灣人，不認同自己是中國人，那麼在中共看來，這就可以認作和平統一的可能性已經完全喪失，因此已經可以對台灣動武了。哪怕你台灣不修改憲法，它也可以動武了。《反分裂法》還規定，國務院、中央軍事委員會可以在必要時先採取行動，隨後再向全國人民代表大會常務委員會通報。這就是説，《反分裂法》授權共軍可以先斬後奏。這就是説，哪怕明天中共就對台動武，它也可以振振有詞地宣稱師出有名。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;之所以在眼下，中共還不打算對台動武，説穿了就一條：怕美軍介入。關於這個問題，下面還要談。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（2）烏克蘭與台灣&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;俄國發動侵烏之戰，使人們聯想到台灣。中共打台灣，與俄國打烏克蘭有一些可比性，但也有不可比性，俄國打烏克蘭，可以有好幾種不同的戰略目標：目標 A——最好是把澤連斯基政府打倒，扶植一個親俄的政府，然後再搞一次公投，烏克蘭宣佈迴歸俄羅斯，這對它是最好不過的。達不到這一目標，退而求其次，目標 B——扶植一個親俄政府。如果這點還是做不到，那就是目標 C——讓烏克蘭一分為二，以第聶伯河為界，佔領整個烏克蘭的東部。如果這個目標也做不到，那就是目標 D——烏東地區佔點算點，只要比前年 2 月 24 號開戰之前多佔了一些地方，普京就可以宣佈，他的特殊軍事行動取得了成功。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;俄烏戰爭打了兩年多，現在看來，俄國的目標 A、目標 B、目標 C 都達不到了。烏克蘭要收復失地，把俄軍趕回到前年 2 月 24 日之前也很不容易。雙方很難達成和平協議。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;中共打台灣和俄國打烏克蘭不一樣。中共只能有一個戰略目標，那就是統一，如果達不到統一就輸了，無論它對台灣造成多少損失，對中共而言，達不到統一就是輸了。中共知道這一點，所以它不敢輕啓戰端。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;烏克蘭儘管是得到國際社會公認的一個主權國家，但是出於種種原因，當俄國侵犯烏克蘭時，沒有一個國家直接出兵相助，這就是俄羅斯敢入侵烏克蘭的原因。北約近在咫尺，一線之隔。如果北約願意出兵相助，俄羅斯是不敢打的。台灣雖然沒有得到國際社會的廣泛承認，但是美國有個《台灣關係法》。如果中共武力犯台，美國很可能出兵相助，所以在現階段，中共不會去武統台灣。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（3）中共統一台灣的「北平模式」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;近來，中國大陸、台灣和美國三方軍機軍艦頻頻現身台海。這讓很多人擔心，會不會擦槍走火引爆戰爭。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我以為擦槍走火引爆戰爭的可能性很小。中共國際關係專家、清華大學國際關係研究院院長閻學通講過：「目前在南海和台海地區，都不會發生故意的擦槍走火，因為美國、中國大陸、台灣地區三方對軍事行動的控制都非常嚴格。所以説，首先，在這些地區發生擦槍走火的可能性非常小；其次，即便發生擦槍走火，有關各方也一定能及時地把它控制住，不讓它發展成為戰爭。」&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;近期內，中共會不會武統台灣？中共鷹派人物、《超限戰》一書作者、解放軍少將喬良説：台灣目前形勢，文統無望，只能武統，但不可輕率急進，因為解決台灣問題的關鍵在於先解決中美實力對比。中美未分高下之前，台灣問題不可能徹底解決。只要不斷提高和增強中國克服外部約束的實力，一旦美國沒法介入，收復台灣如探囊取物。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;中共國台辦原副主任王在希曾對媒體説，在和統和武統之間還有第三條道路可供選擇，那就是採用圍而不打的的「北平模式」，僅攻打外島，以戰迫和，以武促統，逼台北就範。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;中共賭的就是，在經過一段時日後，中國的軍力有進一步增長，雖然不是在全球、但只要在台海局部區域取得優勢，當它擺出武統台灣的架勢，美國就會考慮，犯不犯得上為那麼遙遠的一個台灣去跟中國直接刀兵相見。一旦美國不肯直接出兵，那麼面對中共大軍壓境，兵臨城下，台灣也許就只有被「一國兩制」，被「和平統一」了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（4）美國會出兵相助嗎？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;無論是出於對普世價值的分享，還是出於對第一島鏈的戰略考量，美國都在堅守《台灣關係法》護衞台灣的承諾。這是 40 多年來美國曆屆政府一直堅持的立場。但是《台灣關係法》具有模糊性。它沒有明確説一旦中共對台動武，美國是會出兵還是隻賣武器。這幾年，拜登總統幾次回答記者提問都明確回答，美國願意為保護台灣而介入軍事行動。但這只是拜登總統的立場，以後的美國總統會不會也堅持這種立場呢？如果幾年後國際形勢有變，美中兩國的實力對比有變，美國政府是否還會堅持這種強硬立場呢？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2021 年，美國智庫「芝加哥全球事務委員會」做過一次民調。那次民調顯示，如果中國武力犯台，過半數美國人贊成派兵保護。2022 年 6-7 月，美國&quot;德國馬歇爾基金會&quot;與&quot;德國貝塔斯曼基金會&quot;對 14 個國家的民調顯示，如果中國武力犯台，多數受訪者比較支持以外交舉措與經濟制裁應對，同意對台灣輸送武器和出兵援助的不到 5%；就連最支持台灣的美國，同意對台灣輸送武器和出兵援助的也不到 10%。同年 8 月，佩洛西訪問台灣，中共在台海進行大規模軍演。這兩件事強化了國際社會對台灣的關注，強化了民主國家的民眾、尤其是美國民眾對台灣的支持度。如果再做一次民調，結果很可能會和上一次不一樣。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我認為，如果中共武力犯台，民主國家的民眾大多數會支持以外交舉措和經濟制裁應對，同意輸送武器會少些，同意出兵的更少。台灣是海島，有海峽天塹，易守難攻。但也由於台灣是海島，別的國家要運送物資和武器就更難，接收難民也更難。最嚴重的問題是，目前，全世界絕大多數國家以及聯合國等國際組織都承認只有一箇中國，台灣是中國的一部分。這就意味着，如果中共對台動武，國際社會都會因為那是中國內政，因此很難給台灣提供有實質性意義的幫助。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;不錯，已故日本前首相安倍晉三講過：台灣有事就是日本有事。但這話是安倍下台後講的，要是在台上就不好這麼講。安倍講了「台灣有事就是日本有事」後，中共外交部提出抗議，日本政府駁回中方的抗議，理由就是「因為安倍晉三已經不再是政府官員了」。既然現在日台雙方連正式邦交都沒有，日本怎麼可能在中共武力犯台時出兵相助呢？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（5）警惕台灣淪為犧牲品&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在美國，一直有不同的聲音。哈佛大學教授、「修昔底德陷阱」一説的提出者格雷厄姆·艾利森，曾在《外交事務》上發表文章，題目是「美國要學會尊重其他大國的勢力範圍」。文中講到，1945 年 2 月 4 日雅爾塔會議期間，後來被稱為「遏制戰略之父」的喬治‧凱南給他的同事、時任羅斯福總統的俄文翻譯兼蘇聯問題首席顧問的查爾斯‧博倫發去一封緊急密信。信中説，蘇聯會盡力維持對歐洲的大範圍控制，問題是美國應採取何種對策。凱南問道：「我們為什麼不可以體面而確定地和它妥協——坦誠地將歐洲劃分成美蘇各自的勢力範圍——確保我們不進入俄羅斯的勢力範圍，也不讓俄羅斯闖入我們的地盤？」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;艾利森寫到，凱南這一主張，成為後來數十年美國戰略的支柱，其基本前提是對勢力範圍的接受，即承認某些地區將由蘇聯主導。在隨後 40 年裏，數任美國總統都經歷了危機，因為美國的信條宣稱某些權利是普世性的，所以當受蘇聯主導的國家內部尋求行使這些權利的自由鬥士遭到鎮壓時，美國理當考慮派遣軍隊的選項。但歷任美國總統都毫無例外地選擇旁觀而不是幹預：比如艾森豪威爾面對 1956 年 10 月匈牙利事件，約翰遜面對 1968 年「布拉格之春」，等等。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;可以想見，如果美國政府接受艾利森的主張，像美蘇冷戰期間接受彼此勢力範圍那樣，接受美國與中國各自的勢力範圍，台灣很可能是首當其衝的犧牲品。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（6）「一中兩府」模式是可行之道&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;由於台灣與大陸大小懸殊，台灣的安全需要國際社會的維護。然而，由於台灣缺少國際承認，因此台灣的安全很難獲得國際社會的維護。迄今為止，台灣得到的唯一的外部支持就只有美國。從長遠看，台灣還需要更多的外部支持。近些年來，台灣在國際社會的能見度有顯著提升。但是，台灣的國際地位並沒有得到實質性的提升。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;去年，美國眾議院以口頭表決方式無異議通過一部旨在協助台灣抵禦中國外交孤立的法案，釐清聯合國 1971 年通過的 2758 號決議只承認中華人民共和國的代表是中國在聯合國唯一的合法代表，並未涉及台灣在聯合國的代表權，也沒有對中華人民共和國與台灣的關係採取立場，或包含任何涉及台灣主權的聲明。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這部法案似乎給別的國家承認台灣提供了一種可行的方式。但問題是，這部法案只在眾議院得到通過，參議院還沒有通過。台灣的一些邦交國本來想借助於這部法案提出的對聯合國 2758 號決議的重新解讀，促成台灣進入聯合國。但是在不久前的聯合國會議上，就連這些親台灣的國家也沒有把它作為正式議案向大會提出。別的國家逡巡不前也很好理解：如果以這種方式承認台灣是切實可行的，美國政府幹嘛不帶頭這麼做呢？英國外交大臣也發表講話，贊同對聯合國 2758 號決議的新解讀，但是英國自己也沒有以這種方式承認台灣。可見這種方式並不能幫助台灣擺脫在國際上的孤立困境。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在我看來，要使台灣擺脫被孤立的困境，最簡單、也最可行的辦法就是，美國在保持和中華人民共和國正式邦交的同時，又和中華民國建交。這就是「一箇中國，兩個政府」模式，也就是兩韓模式。既然中共自己在宣示它的「一箇中國」原則時，從 2000 年起，早就不再反對「一箇中國，兩個政府」了，早就不再反對以兩韓模式處理兩岸關係了，因此它不可能對此做出什麼激烈的反應。有關美台建交的法理依據與現實可行性，我在「美台建交，此其時也」一文裏有詳細論述。這裏就不再重複了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（7）時間站在哪一邊？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2005 年 4 月，我曾經寫過一篇文章「時間站在哪一邊」。文章最後一段寫到：「一切就歸結到時間上。時間會站在誰一邊？不少人會説，時間會站在台灣一邊。因為台灣站在歷史正確的一邊。不過這是對較長的未來而言。在較短的未來也有可能出現相反的情況。關鍵是大陸。隨着時間的推移，大陸是會變得自由民主呢，還是會變得十分強大但依然專制？結論：必須大力催化大陸自由民主。大陸能否及時地走上自由民主之路，關係到大陸人民的切身利益，關係到世界的和平與穩定，也關係到台灣自由民主的生死存亡。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;19 年過去了。19 年來，大陸沒有變得自由民主，而是變得更強大而且更專制。今天的台灣比 19 年前更不安全。固然在 3、5 年內，台灣還是安全的；但 5 年、10 年以後呢？照目前這種趨勢下去，未來的專制中國有可能變得更強大，不但台灣很可能會淪陷，整個世界的形勢都不堪設想。因此，我們必須從根本上扭轉這種趨勢，我們必須促進中國大陸的改變，向着自由民主的改變。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>過份閃亮的夜空？光影表演與遺跡的張力</title>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;作者：遠東釣魚郎（澳門學 16 號作者之一）&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;在剛過去的農曆新年，不知除了擠擁的街頭外，各位讀者是否留意到各處所舉辨的應節活動。在眾多務求使城市洋溢喜慶氣氛的巡遊匯演、煙火表演及裝飾中，卻有可謂特別「顯眼」的例外。事緣政府在農曆年期間，先後於大三巴&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://aamacau.com/2024/02/04/%e3%80%90%e5%9c%96%e8%bc%af%e3%80%91-%e4%b8%80%e5%a0%b4%e8%88%87%e6%b0%91%e5%90%8c%e6%ad%a1%e7%9a%84%e6%98%a5%e7%af%80%e9%9f%b3%e6%a8%82%e6%9c%83-%e8%ad%a6%e5%8a%9b%e5%8d%bb%e5%8c%85%e5%9c%8d/&quot;&gt;舉辦「光影表演」&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;，即於牌坊建築表面投射不同的節日圖像及燈光表演。由於表演燈光集中的關係，景觀於遠處亦能清晰看見。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;對於此一劃破城市夜空、平日並不多見的城市景觀，卻有&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://aamacau.com/2024/02/03/%e5%a4%a7%e4%b8%89%e5%b7%b4%e7%aa%81%e8%ae%8a%e3%80%8c%e5%b0%84%e7%87%88%e7%a7%80%e3%80%8d-%e7%b6%b2%e6%b0%91%e7%9b%b4%e6%89%b9%e5%85%89%e6%b1%a1%e6%9f%93%e5%9a%b4%e9%87%8d-%e9%99%b3%e4%bf%8a/&quot;&gt;意見&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;認為強烈的燈光效果造成光污染。而於建築上所「展示」的不同圖像及內容，亦似乎與大三巴作為「遺跡」的景觀格格不入。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/539c4717-7e8f-4959-9f95-94326a9a3106.jpeg/public&quot;

rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://aamacau.com/2019/10/03/%e5%a4%a7%e4%b8%89%e5%b7%b4%e3%80%8c%e6%9f%93%e7%b4%85%e3%80%8d-%e6%95%99%e5%8d%80%ef%b8%b0%e5%85%89%e9%9b%95%e8%a1%a8%e6%bc%94%e6%87%89%e8%88%87%e5%ae%97%e6%95%99%e8%83%8c%e6%99%af%e7%9b%b8%e9%97%9c/&quot;&gt;例子&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;，便是 2019 年國慶時，政府於大三巴投射以紅色為底色，慶祝中華人民共和國成立 70 週年的演出。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;事實上，光雕投影（Projection Mapping）作為一種於建築物表面投影不同事物的技術，在外國的文化活動已被廣泛應用。那麼，我們為甚麼會產生投射內容與投射對象（如遺跡）兩者格格不入的印象呢？本篇文章正好利用大三巴再次被染色的契機，藉由外國學者對於「遺跡與投影」此一議題的&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;2019 年為慶祝中國 70 週年，大三巴被染紅（Image: 論盡）&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;但如果進一步思考，我們或可以發現這樣一種技術，其實亦是一種改變對建築物理解的方式。試想像我們平時在「觀看」遺跡時，往往能想像到的，便是此一遺跡在「當下」所呈現的面貌，以及由其面貌所能聯想到的歷史。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;通過投影技術的介入，例如模擬重建遺跡的歷史原貌或色彩，展示有關遺跡的歷史資料，或是突顯出遺跡本身不易看出的建築特徵等，皆能夠增加對於遺跡的認識。進一步地，投影技術亦可透過更具實驗性的方式，把遺跡變為藝術表演的一環，從而帶來扭轉對遺跡既定形象的可能性。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因此，透過改變遺跡在建築上的外觀，投影技術能為遺跡呈現一種與既有形象不同的面貌，並通過不同面貌而更新其形象，甚至能夠產生新的意義。由此，投影亦可謂是一種「活化」遺跡的另類取徑。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;甚麼樣的投影與遺跡&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;必須注意的是，上述的討論其實預設了一種投影與遺跡的關係，那便是投影的呈現方式及內容至少在一定程度上，與遺跡的建築形式及氛圍相容。在現實的情況中，此種關係不但非理所當然，而且還有更多樣及複雜的組合。這些不同的模式，亦把投影作為一種「介入」遺跡的方法，並預設了某種看待遺跡的方式。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;首先，投影的內容本身，事實上可以完全脫離於遺跡本身的背景。大家可以想像在平行時空中，大三巴的立面被用作投射有關澳門「手信」的廣告內容。當然，杏仁餅跟豬肉乾在當下的澳門，並非全然與大三巴無關的事物（或許有些人甚至把大三巴當作是手信街），但在此一種模式下，大三巴便已不再是那個充滿歷史氛圍的學院遺跡，而只是被用作能夠聚集人流的廣告「佈景版」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/6af0275b-9d72-459a-bed6-f6864b22d4c8.jpeg/public&quot;

            <title>寫給我夢見的那個被欺凌的小孩</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;親愛的孩子：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;夢見你距今已經六年了。今天專誠寫信給你向你表達感謝。感謝你讓我對自己今生的使命有更清晰更透徹的瞭解。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;六年前的一個晚上，我在夢中見到你。你是個只有兩三歲的幼童。當時我看見你和另外兩三個比你稍大的小孩在一個房間。那兩三個比你大的小孩合夥欺負你。他們打你巴掌，又把你的手腳朝著相反方向拉扯。幼小的你無力反抗，只能大聲哭叫。當時在另一房間有幾個大人。他們明明聽見你的哭叫聲，但彷彿若無其事似的繼續麻將灑落。當時的我心急如焚，很想做些事情救你脫離欺凌。立即抱走你；或者賞那幾個吃屎的大人幾巴掌，迫使他們制止那幾個欺負你的小孩。但在夢中，我只是觀眾，只能眼白白看著這一切，卻什麼都做不了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;那次的所見使我內心產生極大震撼。之後大約半年時間，我一想起你就會忍不住流淚。我自己也十分疑惑：只是一個夢境，為什麼我對它的記憶如此深刻，情緒又如此波動？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;後來回頭梳理整件事，我才發現夢見你的意義。在夢見你之前一段頗長的日子裡，我正經歷個人發展的低潮。我在做的所有事情都彷彿進入瓶頸，即使花盡力氣推動也寸步難行。我開始質疑為何我要來到這個世界成為現在的自己？我今生的目的和使命到底是什麼？為瞭解答這些問題，我曾經想過找催眠師替我進行前世回溯催眠，看看在出生之前究竟發生過什麼事情，當時我的靈魂因何會決定來這世界。經過反覆思想這個夢境，以及令我內心震撼的原因之後，我發現這個夢正是我要找的答案：眼見欺凌的發生，我不要只做觀眾。我要走進故事裡面擔任一個角色，去改變糟糕的情節。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;反觀我們身處的現實世界，欺凌何嘗不是無所不在，無日無之？帝王們為了滿足爭霸的慾望，不惜侵略他國，這難道不是欺凌？戰地兒童遭到俘虜，硬生生地與父母家人分開，被帶到遠離家鄉的地方，還要被灌輸仇恨自己本國的思想，這難道不是欺凌？因宗教信仰的不同，整個部族的男人遭殺害，婦女被老酒成為性奴，這難道不是欺凌？每天在校園裡、職場中，欺凌的事情更是多如牛毛。是的，我的靈魂當初決定要來，就是不想只當觀眾，而是要投入充滿欺凌情節的故事中，擔任一個能做些改變的角色。即使只是一個微不足道的小角色，都比單單觀看來得強。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;不再繼續做觀眾，開始投入故事的我，仍然充滿無力感。個人力量實在太微小，而且受著自己在世的位置所掣肘，能做到的確實非常有限。即便如此，既然有幸來到，我會盡力發揮自己，把掌握的資源，得到的愛和幸福分享出去，期望盡量減少欺凌造成的傷害。孩子，我要衷心感謝你。因着你，我能看清楚今生的使命。不會再因個人發展的不順遂而懷憂喪志。即使自己只是微弱的萬分一光源，也要發出這份光。衷心希望當每一個萬分一光源都亮起來時，這個世界不會再有欺凌。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;滿心感謝你的陶樂思&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Liu Cixin and his &quot;Three-Body Problem&quot;: the Coexistence of Conscience Pollution and Grandeur Deep（4）</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(Continued from Part 3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(12) The magnificent epic of Social Darwinism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Compared with whitewashing dictators, gender bias, and contempt for the masses, which are the &quot;branches&quot; of Liu Cixin&#39;s thought, its socialist values 鈥嬧€媋 re the &quot;trunk&quot; of Liu Cixin and &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Regarding the social Darwinist tendency expressed by Liu Cixin in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, I do not need to cite new examples. There are so many analyzes and examples in the previous article, and almost everywhere there is a social Darwinist flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The core of the so-called &quot;social Darwinism&quot; is &quot;the law of the jungle and survival of the fittest.&quot; These eight characters are also the core of the theory of evolution in nature, and Sheda moved this from nature to human society. These eight words may seem simple, but they can cover everything. There are many analytical studies on the specific content and manifestations of Social Darwinism, but I will not go into them here. I will directly analyze Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and Liu himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The three elements of a novel are characters, environment and plot. It can be said that these three elements are equal to the entire content of the novel. As for Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, its characters, environment, and storyline are all full of social Darwinism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Wade, Shi Qiang, and Zhang Beihai relied on unscrupulous means to achieve their important goals. Moreover, it is necessary to use methods that should not be even resolutely opposed under the evaluation system of civilized society in order to achieve its important purpose and save mankind. Vedder is a typical Social Darwinist, while the other two are not complete Social Darwinists, but sometimes show social Darwinist ideological tendencies and actions. Cheng Xin, on the other hand, is their opposite. Cheng Xin&#39;s thoughts and actions are in line with the moral principles and legal requirements of a civilized environment. She is even very caring, kind, and upright. However, these virtues are exactly the reasons for her failure and ultimately the destruction of most of mankind. The essential. To borrow a line from a poem, &quot;Despicability is the passport of the despicable, and nobility is the epitaph of the noble.&quot; These are, of course, characteristics and manifestations of Social Darwinism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The design and description of the environmental background in the article also make people feel the prominence of Social Darwinism. The &quot;dark forest&quot; theory and reality are where the socialist color is most prominent. In addition, such as the background of the Cultural Revolution and Ye Wenjie&#39;s experience, the process of human beings competing with the Three-Body Problem, and the performance of the &quot;rabble&quot; or various popular characters in the article, all reflect the cruelty and darkness of this society, including power, villains, cruelty, and lies. Betrayal of trust, bullying the weak and fearing the strong, bullying the good and fearing the evil... are all telling readers that Social Darwinism is the basis and mainstream of social laws, and only by adapting to this law of survival can we win or at least survive. Rejecting or even resisting the rules of Social Darwinism will not only Unable to survive, not even the dregs will be left after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not only from the basic elements of the novel, the social Darwinism of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is everywhere. According to the time and narrative sequence of the plot, Socialism also runs through the entire novel. (Although the opening part of the novel and the part recalling Ye Wenjie’s Cultural Revolution experience rarely involve the Trisolaran world, these human intrigues are all for the people who follow. The struggle in the Trisolaran world provided the introduction and foreshadowing). The process of human struggle with the Trisolaran world, the ups and downs of success and failure, are all related to the thoughts and behaviors of Social Darwinism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The simplified process of the confrontation between humans and the Three-Body Problem is as follows: The injustice and persecution of human society itself gave rise to rebels like Ye Wenjie. However, some other rebels joined the army of rebels against evil humans because their lives were too superior and their sense of morality and justice was too strong. After human rebels led to the invasion of Trisolaris, the earth fell into a deep trough in response to the crisis. But after the great trough, people learned from the painful experience of &quot;giving civilization to the years&quot; and achieved recovery. But after recovery, humans lost their vigilance and sense of crisis. At the same time, after learning about the opacity of human thinking, Trisolaris learned to deceive, successfully narcotized people in the illusion of peace, and then defeated humans in one fell swoop in the interstellar battle. And mankind has recovered from the desperate situation by establishing a dark forest deterrence system. But after recovery, he &quot;relapsed&quot; and once again relaxed his vigilance, became weak and undefended because of his emphasis on morality and &quot;human rights (&quot;human rights&quot; here also includes the right to life on other planets), and chose a &quot;holy mother&quot; like Cheng Xin as the &quot;obsessionist&quot; Swordman&quot;. And once again humanity was almost defeated because of this. The price of victory is to expose both the Earth and Trisolaris to the dark forest targets of the universe. And mankind once again lost the opportunity to escape the attack of the dark forest because of its emphasis on morality and &quot;human rights&quot;, and eventually all but a very small number of people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Obviously, all this reflects the social reality of Social Darwinism and the victory of Social Darwinism at the practical level. If you are imprisoned by morality and law, you will fail. If you follow the evil side of human nature and even the universe, you will survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The ideology of a novel is largely (or even entirely) the author&#39;s own ideology. The strong social Darwinist ideas of &quot;Three-Body&quot; are generally endorsed and owned by himself. Moreover, among Liu Cixin&#39;s works, &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is not the only one like this. In Liu Cixin&#39;s other work &quot;Ball Lightning&quot;, there is also an obvious flavor of social Darwinism. For example, the heroine Lin Yun forced the enemy to give up the invasion and allowed her country to win the war (or to save the crisis from the edge of failure and achieve an armistice) by dying together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Ball Lightning&quot; also contains more explicit socialist tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Yes, Dad, after listening to what I said, you looked at me silently for a while, and then took out two photos from the briefcase. The two photos were exactly the same, except that one corner was burnt and the other one was burnt. There were some brown marks on it, which I later learned were bloodstains. The photo showed a family of three. Both parents were military officers, but their military uniforms were very different from those of their father. They wore epaulettes that his father did not have at the time. The girl was as old as I&#39;m pretty much the same. She&#39;s a very beautiful child, with white and rosy skin, like fine porcelain. Growing up in the north, I&#39;ve never seen such good skin. Her hair is so black and long, all the way to her waist. , so cute. Her mother is also very beautiful, and her father is very handsome. They are really a family that I envy. But you tell me, these are two enemy officers, both of whom were killed in our shelling. They were separated when cleaning the battlefield. We found these two identical photos from the two corpses, and now the cute little girl in the middle has no mother or father.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The general said: &quot;I also tell you that the enemies who killed your mother were not bad people. They did that because they were soldiers and had to fulfill their duties, just like dad was a soldier and had to fulfill his duty to kill on the battlefield. Like a mortal enemy.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;鈥︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On the battlefield in southern Xinjiang, one of my comrades-in-arms was licked by its tail. As a result, the skin on his body fell off as soon as it was touched. It was better to be alive than to be dead. In the field hospital, he used a pistol to kill himself while no one was paying attention. It&#39;s over. At that time, I thought of the mother I last saw in the hospital. The skin all over her body was ulcerated, and her fingers were swollen and black. It was impossible to kill herself with a pistol... This experience may make some people stay away from weapons for life, but it also It will make other people obsessed with it. I belong to the latter group. There is a power hidden in the terrifying machine. It is this power that fascinates me like a drug. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;鈥︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Yun, we two women, for our ideals and beliefs, and for our motherland, have embarked on this less traveled road that women should not take. I have walked on this road longer than you, so I know its dangers better. More. All kinds of forces in nature, including those that people think of as the gentlest and most harmless, can be turned into life-destroying weapons, and some of these weapons are so cruel and terrifying that you cannot imagine it until you see it with your own eyes. . But I, a woman you think is like your mother, still want to tell you that our path is not wrong. I have no regrets about my life. I hope you can do the same when you are my age. My child, I have moved When I go to a place you don’t know, I will never contact you again. Before bidding farewell, I will not send you empty blessings. Blessings are meaningless to a soldier. I only give you a warning: those terrible things. Things may one day fall on the heads of your compatriots and relatives, or on the delicate skin of the baby in your arms. The best way to prevent this from happening is to create it before enemies or potential enemies. Come out! My child, this is the blessing I can give you.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;What information do these words convey? Different people will have different interpretations due to different values 鈥嬧€媋 nd interests. However, it is completely defensible to say that it has a social color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It needs to be added that the most shocking social statement is this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Killing them all is the highest priority for a civilization.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In addition to what is in the book, Liu Cixin also performs in reality. As mentioned earlier, when he was debating with a scholar on the topic of &quot;whether to eat humans in order to continue human civilization,&quot; he tended to take the &quot;any means justify the means&quot; stance of cannibalizing people in order to achieve the goal of human continuation. In addition, in some interviews, he also expressed some tendencies, such as endorsing Xinjiang&#39;s &quot;re-education camp&quot; policy. Of course, he has also shown some neutral attitudes. For example, in an interview with media personality Li Jiajia, his comments had no obvious emotions, but were gentle and rational, and his words were pragmatic and neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As I said at the beginning, I certainly don’t have the ability to see what Liu Cixin is thinking through perspective. Everything is just speculation based on reason. I evaluate him as a social Darwinist or a supporter of social Darwinism, which I think is consistent with the facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Returning to &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, this book can be said to fully embody the various characteristics and manifestations of Social Darwinism. The most important thing is that the book tends to support sympathy rather than criticize Social Darwinism, or &quot;the law of the jungle, whatever the means.&quot; opposing. This is also what makes it different from other works that reflect the darkness of human nature and the ugliness of society. This is something that has been discussed before, but it really needs to be said again. Therefore, based on the breadth and depth of content, ideological tendencies, implications, and practical impact of &quot;Three-Body&quot;, it can be called a &quot;magnificent epic of social Darwinism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In fact, the reason why &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is considered to be a social Darwinist thought is largely because a large proportion of its readers are social Darwinists. They worship the laws of the dark forest and are interested in Thomas Wade, Shi Qiang, Zhang Beihai, etc. People admire him very much and admire the idea of 鈥嬧€&quot;losing your animal nature and losing everything&quot; in the book, and then strongly praise the entire book &quot;Three-Body&quot; and highly worship Liu Cixin. . It is the understanding and interpretation of these people that makes the original social Darwinism color of this book even stronger. This is exactly what I want to say. The popularity of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; lies not only in the attractiveness of the content in the book itself, but also in its complementation with the values 鈥嬧€嬧€嬧€媜 f the real Chinese people, which shows the objective reality of the social Darwin culture of China&#39;s intellectual group in the 21st century. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is worth noting that since the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China from the end of 2019 to the present, the economic situation has deteriorated sharply, and except for a very small number of people, life is generally difficult for most people. This gave Social Darwinists a heavy blow, allowing them to discover that &quot;having the ability&quot; and &quot;struggle&quot; still cannot lead to gains. This led to the decline of socialism and stimulated the rise of China&#39;s youth Maoists. But today, China&#39;s young Maoists still have a strong sense of socialism. Coincidentally but to a certain extent inevitable, Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; not only caters to socialists but also to young Maoists, so &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is still popular despite the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(13) 「What to do」 after 「what」?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Obviously, I have repeatedly described and analyzed some issues. Therefore, in the review section, I will not re-list the content, but will base my comments and analysis on what has been written previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Based on the key points I emphasized in the above specific narrative analysis, I acknowledge the existence of various dark and ugly realities mentioned by Liu Cixin; but on the causes and responsibilities of such realities, Liu Cixin and I have different views; but in There are fundamental differences in how to deal with such practical issues (even if some non-qualitative aspects are exactly the same). In other words, Liu Cixin and I have very similar views on &quot;what&quot;, but we have major differences on &quot;why&quot;, and our choices on &quot;how&quot; are qualitatively different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To borrow a few proverbs to summarize &quot;what it is&quot;, they are: &quot;A gentleman cannot defeat a villain&quot;, &quot;Despicableness is the passport of the despicable, and nobility is the epitaph of the noble&quot;, &quot;When you stare into the abyss (and have a grudge against evil, Confrontation), the abyss is also staring at you (you may become an equally evil person in the resistance, otherwise you can be called a &#39;forgiving person&#39;)&quot;, &quot;Good people don&#39;t live long, bad people live forever&quot;... So, what should we do? To be a &quot;gentleman&quot;, &quot;noble person&quot;, &quot;forgiving person&quot;, &quot;good person&quot;, or to be a &quot;villain&quot;, &quot;despicable person&quot;, &quot;evil person&quot;, &quot;bad person&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If under such simple conditions, many people may still choose the former, then what if conditions are added one after another, that is, the important interests of the losers are damaged/the things they care about are damaged? What about serious damage/serious damage to something you care about? What if you can&#39;t survive on your own? The country is destroyed and the family is destroyed, and things that are more important than life will be destroyed in a cruel way? Still choose the former?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If additional conditions are added, good people may not be completely good, and bad people may not be completely bad; good things may not all be advantages, and bad things may not all be disadvantages. There are more high-sounding excuses for choosing to be a &quot;villain&quot;, so how do you choose? Then, many conditions can be added to increase or &quot;ease&quot; the difficulty of selection (&quot;lightening&quot; the difficulty of selection may not necessarily mean &quot;reducing&quot; it), and then how to choose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This type of discussion is not uncommon, especially in developed democracies with free thinking after entering modern society. But there is no definite consensus in these discussions. In countries like China, such discussions are rare, but in reality such choices are constantly being made (although it may not be as clear-cut as the proverbs about good and evil, right and wrong). As for what to choose, it should be well known. Of course, it is not just China. Every person in every country of mankind will face these choices. Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; raises this issue more profoundly and sharply. Wade&#39;s words, &quot;If you lose your humanity, you lose a lot; if you lose your animality, you lose everything&quot; is Liu Cixin&#39;s condensed answer to the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Realistic choices are of course more complicated, but there are always relative good and evil, victory and defeat, good and evil, rise and fall. We often have to make choices, especially when it comes to the fate of individuals, families, communities, countries, and humanity. Each of us may participate in this choice or even participate in this choice many times in our life. Maybe we don&#39;t need to be crazy. We don&#39;t always choose to become evil in order to survive, but it will never be clean after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(14) About Liu Cixin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A person&#39;s masterpiece represents the person himself to a large extent. Liu Cixin is no exception. My analysis and evaluation of the ideological value of this book are, to a large extent, my analysis and evaluation of Liu Cixin himself. I have also specifically mentioned Liu Cixin’s personal words and deeds many times before. If his works are not based on the current values 鈥嬧€媌 ut eulogize justice and light, and speak out and cry out for the weak, then he is undoubtedly a great writer with the depth and value of his thoughts. But now he cannot afford the word &quot;great&quot;. But there is no doubt that his thoughts are profound, his imagination is bold and rich, and his expressive ability is amazing. His depth of thought, imagination and expressive ability can be said to be at the top among many writers in ancient and modern times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Although Liu Cixin&#39;s works are all about science fiction, they have a strong sense of realism. What it says and metaphors are all things that have happened, are happening, and will happen in the real world. Rather than saying that Liu Cixin is a science fiction writer, it is better to say that he is a special realist writer. But he is different from other critical realist writers. On the one hand, this is because the dark cruelty of the value orientation he promotes is completely different from the works of writers who praise bright justice and sympathize with the victims. On the other hand, he blends reality into science fiction. , and set its sights on the extremely distant future that ordinary people cannot reach, making prophetic judgments that feel quite real and even true, linking the reality of human nature and society with the destiny of mankind and even the universe in the extremely distant future. For example, its depiction of the changes of human beings and the universe at different time scales gives people an extremely intuitive and real feeling, making people feel that this is not a science fiction novel but an epic of human beings and the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Judging from these, Liu Cixin is a giant writer. However, based on what Liu Cixin did in reality, he didn&#39;t look like a real giant. Although his thoughts are profound and his language in various interviews is plain, rigorous, broad and profound, you can see the aspects he exposed in interviews and other matters, as well as his return to &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and other works themselves. This is due to his shallow humanistic background and lack of moral concern (of course he also has some relevant background and certain care, but compared to his status as a &quot;giant&quot;, these are far from enough). Fans of Liu Cixin will make various excuses, and even generally regard this as an advantage rather than a disadvantage. As I said before, Liu Cixin&#39;s fans regard cold-blooded cruelty as mature rationality. However, the judgment of any writer must be based on universal morality and conscience. Liu Cixin is obviously &quot;unqualified&quot;. Just his respect for and whitewashing of the dictator who caused such huge disasters makes him no longer worthy of being called &quot;great&quot; (no matter how amazing his talent is).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, after Liu Cixin won the Hugo Award and &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; became popular around the world, she has become a world-renowned writer and public figure with great influence. He also often gives interviews and discusses his works with Chinese and foreign people. However, in the ten years since he became famous, he has never actively commented on national and social affairs related to the public interest (only when asked did he say something that is in line with the current Chinese government&#39;s position). He has never used his influence to do anything constructive for his two hometowns (Henan where he was born and went to school, and Shanxi where he worked and settled), which are still relatively poor and backward. He has never done anything constructive for the fellow villagers who are suffering in his hometown. Once (but after he became famous, he quickly returned to Tieba to anonymously respond to colleagues who had criticized him. Although it is understandable, it also shows that he cares more about personal emotions and does not consider the overall situation of the country and mankind, even if his thoughts extend to the universe) . In the face of various major controversial issues in China and the world, and many realities in Henan and Shanxi provinces that need to be criticized and changed, he chose to avoid them, which can be said to have no public awareness and sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is not because he cannot see the darkness and crisis in reality. On the contrary, he is very aware of it but refuses to talk about it. In &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and other works, he reflects that he has a good understanding of the dark side of Chinese society, and even learned through some channels far more inside information than ordinary people can know. However, he refused to directly mention real issues and only discussed the fictional and abstract content of his works without connecting them with reality. For example, in his &quot;The Wandering Earth&quot;, he talks about the earth encountering a crisis of destruction, countries taking measures to deal with it, and the people refusing to cooperate and even rioting due to conspiracy theories. The entire plot is almost exactly the same as the hazards and reactions of the climate crisis that humans face in the real world. But Liu Cixin has never commented on the climate crisis, even though he has mentioned in some interviews that humans should plan for the long term and prevent crises in the universe that may destroy humanity. With Liu Cixin’s erudition and intelligence, it is impossible for him to not understand the huge harm that the climate crisis has on mankind, but he remains silent. Liu Cixin has never expressed any opinions on China&#39;s high-intensity lockdown measures and its impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in recent years. Liu Cixin&#39;s behavior is not only indifferent, but shameful; he is not ignorant, but it is also more corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The thoughts and values 鈥嬧€嬧€嬧€媜 f Liu Cixin&#39;s works are contradictory and very consistent with his personal character and moral level. This sentence may not be easy to understand at first sight, but for those who are familiar with &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and know Liu Cixin well, it should not be difficult to understand as long as they think a little dialectically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The coexistence and even unity of grandeur, profundity and pollution of conscience is the most appropriate and concise evaluation of Liu Cixin’s The Three-Body Problem and Liu Cixin himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But in any case, &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is still worth reading, and Liu Cixin&#39;s thoughts should be understood by more people. We should also think about why there are no people with high moral character and both ability and political integrity in China or even in the world to write a masterpiece like &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. Perhaps, this is the same as the previous difficult choices. Only by accepting the gaze of the abyss can we truly understand what the abyss is. When a person understands the truth about human beings and even the universe, but does not have enough faith to uphold his conscience, he will not be able to get out of the moral and cognitive opposition, which will eventually lead to hissoulof nothingness and depravity. This is really sad and a common occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Liu Cixin and his &quot;Three-Body Problem&quot;: the Coexistence of Conscience Pollution and Grandeur Deep（3）</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;(Continued from Part 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(9) Cheng Xin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cheng Xin is the character Liu Cixin writes about the most, is criticized the most by fans of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and Liu Cixin, and is the most controversial character in this book. To put it simply, she is the opposite of Thomas Vader. Of course, the details are much more complicated. This character is very important and is the focus of the book review, so I have to talk about it in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Holy Mother&quot; is the word most commonly used by fans of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and Liu Cixin to call Cheng Xin. Of course, this is not a compliment, but a deep disdain. If you understand the context of the Chinese Internet, you will know that the word &quot;Madonna&quot; is not only not a good word on the Chinese Internet, but also a particularly malicious and defamatory term. This is also highly relevant to the reality of China, which is highly social Darwinist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, the original meaning of the word &quot;Madonna&quot; on the Chinese Internet is not particularly different from that in the West. It refers to a person who is overflowing with love, loves and tolerates everything, and opposes all hatred and oppression. This kind of people have different attitudes (well, to be precise, &quot;some Chinese people and some Westerners have different attitudes towards this kind of people&quot;). In China, the definition of &quot;Mother&quot; also includes the characteristics of not distinguishing between right and wrong, having no concept of right and wrong, having no position or principles, and blindly exporting love and sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Chinese people hate this kind of people. They believe that this kind of &quot;Madonna&quot; can only do bad things, betray the interests of their own country and ethnic group, and ultimately harm others and themselves. In China, a jungle society, this kind of consequences does often occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I always say China, China, isn’t the world like this? Isn’t it a developed Western country? There is indeed ingratitude and repayment of kindness everywhere in the world, and there are many stories of &quot;farmers and snakes&quot; being played out in the West. I have said repeatedly before that this world is still a jungle world. But this does not mean that everything in the world is like this. All groups in all regions of the world live with such values 鈥嬧€媋 nd behaviors. They are not the same as those in China (even if they are fundamentally the same in terms of &quot;quality&quot;, there are differences in &quot;quantity&quot;. (very different), a society where there are many 「Holy Mothers」 and good deeds can be rewarded well. This is at least the case for a large part of the Western European and American leftists they attack and vilify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, the Chinese people have no sympathy and support for this, but are even more resentful. I don’t know whether it’s jealousy or disbelief, or both (yes, it seems that these two cannot be both for the same object at the same time, but the Chinese can (again, please correct me, it’s 「some Chinese」 who can )). They don’t want to believe that there is really love and peace in this world, or they are extremely jealous, so they madly attack all kinds of 「white leftists」, 「Mothers」 and even such fictional characters. Cheng Xin in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is one of the targets. Of course, there is another kind of person who hates Cheng Xin, but we will talk about this kind of person later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As soon as the name Cheng Xin appeared (the character had not officially appeared), he was reviled by readers (of course this is because they already knew some of the following content in advance, or read it and started from the beginning, and then made notes here). And she officially appeared on the stage when Yun Tianming was about to be euthanized (attempted). She saved Yun Tianming and then said, &quot;You know what? Euthanasia is prepared for you.&quot; This sentence has been sprayed with invisible spit by countless people countless times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, judging from this plot, Cheng Xin deserves to be criticized because she did something immoral. But if it had been done by other people, such as Wade, Shi Qiang, Zhang Beihai, and Luo Ji, these people wouldn&#39;t be so abusive, and would even think it was a decisive act of choosing the greater at the expense of the small. However, Cheng Xin couldn&#39;t do this because she was the &quot;Madonna&quot; and had moral shackles, and whatever she did would be scrutinized. When you are a good person, you cannot do this kind of thing, otherwise it will be &quot;hypocrisy&quot; and &quot;double standards&quot;, even if it is far less hypocritical and double standards than the critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of this, many people must think that I am deliberately trying to be more truthful, it is just a storyline, and readers are just cursing for the fictional story, just to vent their anger. If that were the case, there would be no need for me to say this, or even write the entire article. Of course this is not the case but the opposite. Literary works and interactions with readers deeply reflect the real world and the judgments and choices of real people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the part where Cheng Xin participated in the &quot;Ladder Plan&quot;, no one criticized Cheng Xin. There was nothing to criticize about these technical issues. On the contrary, people should admire her technical level (but this does not prevent her from continuing to criticize her later). Some people even To criticize Liu Cixin for portraying female stereotypes. This is a rare phenomenon among Chinese readers, or it may have only appeared later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Then, there is the plot where Cheng Xin knew that Yun Tianming sent him stars, and then tried her best to prevent Yun Tianming from being &quot;euthanized&quot; but failed. Cheng Xin knew about Yun Tianming&#39;s love for her, so she wanted to save everything. This was logical, and it also showed that her decision to allow Yun Tianming to have euthanasia was not an act of betrayal but an honest mistake. However, here again there are scoldings for her &quot;hypocrisy&quot;. Is she really hypocritical? Obviously not. If we really wanted to condemn him, shouldn&#39;t we blame Vader for being unscrupulous and willing to complete the mission despite knowing that Yun Tianming was Cheng Xin&#39;s lover (or deliberately doing so to make a non-ridiculous prank)? Of course, saying this will make everyone think that I am too serious and boring. But I think those who criticized Cheng Xin for ignoring Vader probably did the same thing in reality. There is no risk in condemning a good person, but there is trouble in attacking someone who is aggressive. And as mentioned before, people always blame good people for their faults, but for bad people it is &quot;there is no need to condemn them because they are bad&quot;. People&#39;s views on artistic figures have always been a reflection of reality, but sometimes they are exaggerated, but the essence is still a reflection of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The next point where Cheng Xin was ridiculed was when she ran for the Sword Bearer and was elected. People chose her, who represents love and peace, as the sword bearer, replacing Luo Ji, who had become serious and tough (he was cynical before), and they did not choose Cao Bin, Bi Yunfeng and others who were similar to Wade. This laid the foundation for mankind&#39;s loss of deterrence against the Trisolaran world. Cheng Xin&#39;s cowardice and hesitation when the three-body detector &quot;Water Drop&quot; attacked the deterrence facility became the focus of intense ridicule and abuse from readers. This performance is also the core factor why Cheng Xin was attacked, cursed and ridiculed, that is, her &quot;holy mother&quot; love and weakness can cause bad things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In fact, I can quite understand the ridicule and abuse of Cheng Xin in this paragraph, and I quite agree with it. Liu Cixin&#39;s arrangement of this content is indeed very reasonable to a certain extent. This is indeed a fatal flaw for those who are considered &quot;white leftists&quot; and &quot;holy saints&quot;, although it may not be a fatal flaw for everyone among them. Kind people always don&#39;t want to hurt others, let alone destroy or die together, or even want to sacrifice themselves to achieve others. And if it is responsible for the rise and fall of a country or nation, then this kind of behavior will lead to the collective sinking or destruction of the entire nation. This is indeed the weakness of the kind and the advantage of the cruel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But like I said before, this is true, but should it be so? Do we have to become evil in order to win? Not necessarily. It’s not that we can’t cultivate people who 「use thunderous means to protect the heart of a Bodhisattva」. There are many such people in reality. During World War II, the German and Japanese armies were extremely ferocious, and the US military was regarded as the &quot;young master soldier.&quot; However, the US military finally defeated the Japanese army, and the US military was also the first to contribute to the defeat of the German army on the Western Front. This has something to do with weapons and equipment, but the US military is not generally afraid of life and death. As for today&#39;s &quot;white left&quot; politicians, many times they just want to abide by their principles and prevent the country and the world from falling into a vicious cycle of retribution and violence for violence. If they really take action, those stubborn and cruel people may not be their opponents. In fact, the &quot;white left&quot; is even more firm in its belief in justice. Wasn’t Robespierre a 「white leftist」 three hundred years ago? The stubborn and conservative old nobles were still beheaded one after another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, a person with Cheng Xin&#39;s personality and value choices is indeed not suitable for such a task that requires decisive killing. If all human beings become weak and lose their vigilance and fighting spirit, they may indeed be &quot;annihilated&quot; by the few remaining crazy and stubborn people. Liu Cixin&#39;s original intention may not be good, but it objectively reminds us that when we maintain goodwill, we should not put down the sword in our hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, from another perspective, is fighting to the death or even dying together really the best choice (whether for oneself, the entire society, or even the opponent), or is this kind of mentality game the best deterrent? Most fans of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and Liu Cixin would say &quot;yes&quot;, but my opinion is wavering between right and wrong. Indeed, the more determined you are to die together, the more likely you are to win the game. This is the core of the game of &quot;who will give in first&quot;. But if no one is willing to bow his head, the world will be destroyed by constantly playing this game. Or, all parties will rack their brains to strengthen themselves and weaken each other, and use any means at any cost. Human beings will lose their conscience and kill the other party or suppress it absolutely. Reason will never be able to defeat the fist. Hatred and the weak will expand with the blessing of intelligence, and the human world will become More jungle than animal jungle. As for the balance of deterrence, is there ever a balance? Will there not be a moment of loss of control? Is such a world really good? Who can be sure that he is the ultimate winner? Or is there a final winner? Should those losers live by the victors? Is this the human civilized world we pursue?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But if you don&#39;t do this, then those who do it will win and dominate the group, region, country, and world. Such a world is, of course, hell. Therefore, in order to fight against the devil, I have to become the devil. I just hope it is a devil who is not so evil, or preferably has the methods of a devil but the heart of an angel. But how could the angel&#39;s mind not be polluted in such a game and competition for survival?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The next point where Cheng Xin was taunted and attacked was for the same reason as before. Cheng Xin stopped Vader and others from researching the light speed spacecraft and asked them to give up their confrontation with the government and put down their weapons. And this also doomed almost all human beings to extinction. Ironically, she ended up being one of the very few survivors who did not become two-dimensional with the solar system. Her prevention led to the almost total annihilation of humanity in the solar system, but she was able to escape. It would be strange not to be scolded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But this is also her good intention to do bad things. Or maybe it&#39;s because she always does bad things with good intentions, which makes her even more detestable. If someone had bad intentions and did bad things, like Wade or Ye Wenjie, people would not be so aggressive and abusive. This is what I said before, so I won’t dwell on it anymore. At this point, she deserved to be scolded. However, I still want to emphasize the good intentions, because &quot;good intentions&quot; are already rare things in the real world, and bad things done with good intentions do not always happen. In many cases, the probability is still less than 50%. %of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In fact, Liu Cixin also wrote many plots in her article that almost everyone thought were positive and shining points of Cheng Xin, such as giving up the huge sum of money that the United Nations could pay her to buy the star that Yun Tianming gave her, but choosing to donate it instead , meeting Yun Tianming for a responsible adventure, and giving up the small universe to return the quality of the universe for the purpose of restarting the universe. These have also been praised by many readers. But why do so many people still abuse Cheng Xin? Do these two waves of people overlap?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is some overlap. Some people can separate and evaluate a person with coherent behavior, affirming some parts of them but rejecting other parts. If one part deserves recognition and the other part deserves disdain, then of course that is okay and very appropriate. However, it is foolish or morally corrupt to deny outright something that should not be cast aside or should be evaluated more comprehensively and objectively, or if the denial fails to get to the point and instead is insulted indiscriminately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There are also some parts that do not overlap, and they are consistently abusive towards Cheng Xin. In addition to the jealousy I mentioned earlier or the belief that a &quot;holy mother&quot; like Cheng Xin cannot be trusted, there is another reason that is even more terrifying. That is, those evil people and scoundrels, including sanctimonious conservatives and green-faced and fanged Social Darwinists. These people reviled Cheng Xin and all &quot;white leftists&quot; and &quot;holy mothers&quot; because they were deeply afraid that the world would change to love and peace, and that they would be excluded or assimilated. In order for themselves to continue to live in evil, for their evil values 鈥嬧€嬧€嬧€媡 o last forever, and to achieve their various practical and value interests, they must denigrate, completely deny, and criticize the &quot;white left&quot; and the &quot;Mother of the Holy Mother&quot; in every possible way. , so that the ugly values 鈥嬧€媡 hey advocate can continue to prevail in the world, and these people can continue to thrive. There are many such people in the world, especially in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is worth mentioning that Liu Cixin himself also has a rather negative view of the character Cheng Xin he created. It does not mean that he is dissatisfied with the portrayal of the character Cheng Xin, but that he is disgusted with people with characteristics like Cheng Xin. Therefore, Liu Cixin himself is one of those people who attacked and abused Cheng Xin, and his views are more profound (how can he not understand the image he created deeply), so his evil is also more terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Finally, let me talk about my evaluation of people like Cheng Xin. I think it is 60% positive, 60% right (not 60% &quot;right&quot;) and 40% wrong. Their quality is commendable, but their value choices are often undesirable. If love and peace could solve everything in the world, world harmony would have been realized long ago. For the sake of justice, we have to make some bad preparations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(10) Gender bias controversy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; was published (especially after it was translated into English and other foreign languages 鈥嬧€媋 nd won the Hugo Award), it caused great controversy. One of the controversies is that he believes that his works are sexist and stereotypical against women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After reading the full article, I found that this is indeed the case. I have said before that his portrayal of Ye Wenjie, Shao Lin and the female Red Guards reflects discrimination and prejudice. In fact, more than that, there is widespread and obvious sexism and prejudice in more parts of the book and overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Throughout the book, Liu Cixin portrays more than ten main characters, most of whom are relatively positive characters (at least these people are &quot;essentially good people&quot;). Most of these people have made a lot of sacrifices and made outstanding contributions in saving the earth. Except for Say, who is set to be the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who is a woman, these characters are all men, such as Luo Ji, Shi Qiang, Zhang Beihai, Thomas Wade, Cao Bin, Taylor, Ray Diaz, Wang Miao, Chang Weiss et al. Even Sai, who clearly has a positive image and has made great contributions, is a supporting role with a limited number of appearances. And the few negative images are almost &quot;taken over&quot; by women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In addition to the female Red Guards I mentioned earlier, there is also a special vilification of female images. At the end of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, it is written about the two-dimensionalization of the solar system, the scene when Cheng Xin and Ai AA left in a light-speed spacecraft, and other people trying to escape discovered them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Look, why is that ship accelerating so fast?!&quot; a woman screamed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Oh my God, the people in there are going to be crushed to pieces,&quot; one man said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Then another man&#39;s voice appeared: &quot;You idiots, an accelerating spacecraft like that will be crushed! But it doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s not a fusion engine, that&#39;s a space curvature drive!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Warp drive?! Light speed ship?! Light speed ship!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;It seems that the rumors are true. They are secretly building a light-speed spacecraft and escaping by themselves...&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Ah ah ah ah ah! Ah! Ah!!!&quot; This is the voice of the first woman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;The one in front, intercept it! Hit it to death!!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was the woman&#39;s voice again, &quot;Ah! They can reach escape velocity, they can escape! They can live!! Ahhhh!! I want a light speed ship!! Stop it! Kill the people inside!!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The vilification of women is self-evident. In addition, there are some small figures with negative images that go unnoticed. For example, the director of the neighborhood committee who drove Luo Ji away was also a woman (of course, in reality, most neighborhood committee directors are indeed women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is also the objectification of women. For example, Luo Ji&#39;s wife Zhuang Yan is a highly objectified female image. Of course, this is not entirely a stereotype, but a character image deliberately designed by Liu Cixin to meet the needs of the plot (such as to set off Luo Ji&#39;s character and its changes). But on the other hand, it is not necessary to set up other characters and storylines that vilify women, and the negative characters do not have to be set as women (but Liu Cixin set them up like this).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cheng Xin, the &quot;Madonna&quot; image who &quot;does not succeed enough but more than fails&quot;, is a woman, and there is a faint hint in the book that it is her femininity (&quot;Madonna&quot;) that makes her &quot;lost.&quot; This has been explained and analyzed in the previous section dedicated to the analysis of Cheng Xin, so I will not repeat it again. Cheng Xin is also the female character in Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; who permeates sexism and stereotypes most quietly and deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The female scientist Ke Manlin, who has the opposite personality and temper to Cheng Xin, is the kind of woman who is rude and also likes to compete with women (women find it difficult to be a woman).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Use resources to change the principle?&quot; an older French woman named Cormanlin said in a disdainful tone. She was a senior consultant from the European Space Agency. She noticed the way the men looked at Cheng Xin, and she felt very uncomfortable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;鈥︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There were several more laughs, and Ke Manlin laughed the loudest, &quot;Honey, you provided us with a cartoon-like scene...&quot; With more and more laughter, she continued, &quot;You&#39;d better do it again. Assignment for freshman year, calculate push-to-weight ratio.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;鈥︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The men&#39;s eyes turned away from Cheng Xin one by one. Now they finally began to seriously consider what she said, and their admiration for her was temporarily ignored. Only Ke Manlin kept staring at Cheng Xin, as if she didn&#39;t recognize her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;鈥︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She held the document up for a few seconds, and instead of handing it to anyone, she dropped it hard to the ground.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;What the hell!&quot; Ke Manlin yelled angrily.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;鈥︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;You, and you,&quot; Wade pointed at Cheng Xin and Ke Manlin, &quot;Such senseless mental loss will not be allowed in the future.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Due to space issues and the trivial distribution of related content, I cannot list all the discrimination and prejudice against women in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, but the above examples are enough. In fact, other readers have also seen it, so there is no need. I list and repeat them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These are undoubtedly sexist and biased. But is this an objective fact to some extent? That is, are women really like this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In my personal opinion, first of all, fundamentally speaking, the negative behaviors and negative personality traits of these women portrayed by Liu Cixin, especially the various ugly words and deeds, are common to both men and women and are not unique to women. Secondly, it is true that to some extent and under certain circumstances, women do have some characteristics that are different from men in some aspects, such as the above-mentioned vilified or stereotyped images or words and deeds. However, the degree is far less serious than Liu Cixin&#39;s portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And, are they born this way, or have they been shaped and disciplined into these ways by the patriarchal society? This question is important, very important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I believe that this is of course the result of acquired social environment, rather than an innate inevitable situation. Women are particularly intolerant, anti-intellectual, objectified, and weak in some things and situations. They are created, seduced, and forced by society, to be precise, the patriarchal society. Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;Three-Body&quot; is a person who participated in the creation and creation of this. Part of the temptation and coercion. This is like saying that &quot;the cultural quality of migrant workers is low.&quot; It is not that the quality of migrant workers is inherently low, but that they are often in poor family and social environments and do not have the conditions to receive a good education and a good external environment. They are Victims rather than natural low-quality bad elements. What we need to do is to sympathize with and change, and to condemn the people or institutional environment that caused such consequences, rather than scorning, ridiculing and pointing fingers at these victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the same way, the intolerance, anti-intellectualism, objectification, and weakness of women are not a reason to discriminate against women, nor are they an excuse for the patriarchal society to oppress and blame women. On the contrary, they are victims, and they need to bear the responsibility of the patriarchal society. Responsibility, through changes in systems, culture, and habits, to reduce or even eliminate non-biological gender differences and achieve true gender equality and gender justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What needs to be emphasized in particular is that the differences between men and women in certain traits that I am talking about are far smaller than the differences within men and women, and are generally smaller than the differences between groups with different levels of education and income. . Regardless of physical or non-physical aspects, the commonalities between men and women are far greater than their &quot;personality&quot; or specificity, especially in non-physical aspects. People can discuss and have their own opinions on gender differences, but this should not limit or persecute the basic human rights of any gender (including transgender people) and the right to make free choices in all matters of study, work, and life. Using these involuntary differences to judge, discipline, and blame men and women or people of any other gender/gender identity is fallacious and should be criticized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So, there is so much sexism and prejudice in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, does it mean that Liu Cixin himself has such sexism and prejudice? The answer is obviously yes. Liu Cixin denied this in the interview, but his denial is not valid because it goes against the facts. In other words, even if Liu Cixin did not intentionally discriminate subjectively, she still had the essence of objective discrimination. When Liu Cixin showed off certain traits that are considered to be more prominent in women, it was obviously a discriminatory stance, rather than an attitude that needed sympathy and change, nor was it specifically intended to expose and criticize the impact of patriarchal society on women. Discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In addition, Liu Cixin once hypothesized in a debate with scholar Jiang Xiaoyuan,If the world ends and only he, Jiang Xiaoyuan and a female host are left, &quot;The three of us carry everything about human civilization, and we must eat her to survive. Will you eat it?&quot; Liu Cixin stood at the &quot;Eat it&quot; &quot;Party. Although this is largely just a hypothesis, Liu&#39;s assumption that the target was a &quot;beautiful woman&quot; (even though there was indeed a female host next to them at the time), that is, a woman, inherently implies that women will be sacrificed. Even without going into detail, this is enough to reflect Liu Cixin&#39;s certain bad psychology and value orientation towards women. Even as a joke, it&#39;s inappropriate. Moreover, Liu Cixin argued with Jiang seriously, which shows that he did not take it as a joke, but took the hypothesis seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(11) Public image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, Liu Cixin not only did not endow the people with qualities such as unity and courage, but instead gave them extremely strong belittlement and contempt. In Liu Cixin&#39;s writings, the masses are selfish, blindly obedient, weak, and barbaric, and are an out-and-out &quot;rabble.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In addition to the Red Guards&#39; criticism of Ye Zhetai mentioned above and the screams of female refugees when the earth became two-dimensional, there are also many plots that reflect the bad nature of the masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For example, Luo Ji predicted that a star would be destroyed based on the laws of the dark forest. When the incident was made public, the star fleet was destroyed. The public worshiped Luo Ji as a god-like person in order to survive the crisis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Seeing Luo Ji stop, the crowd moved towards him. Two or three meters away from him, the people in the front row tried their best to block the advance of the crowd behind him, and then knelt down. The people behind him also knelt down one after another, and the glowing The crowd dropped like waves receding from the beach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Lord, save us!&quot; Luo Ji heard someone say, and his words caused a buzzing resonance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Our God, save the world!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Great spokesperson, uphold justice in the universe!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Angel of justice, save mankind!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;鈥︹€」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When Luo Ji showed his inability to solve the crisis, people&#39;s views on him and the way they treated him took a 180-degree turn:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On a cold and rainy autumn afternoon, the resident representative meeting of the fifth district of New Life made a decision: to expel Luo Ji from the community on the grounds that he had affected the normal lives of the residents in the district. During the snow project, Luo Ji often went out to attend meetings, but he still spent most of his time in the community. He kept in touch with various organizations involved in the snow project from his residence. After Luo Ji resumed his identity as a Wallfacer, the five New Life Districts were placed under martial law, affecting the lives and work of residents. Later, as Luo Ji&#39;s status declined, the martial law in the community was gradually relaxed, but the situation got worse: from time to time, people from the city gathered downstairs where Luo Ji lived, heckled and taunted him, and even shouted at him. Rocks were thrown at the windows, and the news media took an interest in the scene, often with as many reporters as protesters. But the real reason for Luo Ji&#39;s expulsion was the complete disappointment in him among the hibernators.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;鈥︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Facing this man who had exhausted everything, the director showed no mercy at all. Like other people of that era, she always felt that no matter how dark the world was, ultimate justice always existed somewhere in the dark. Luo Ji first confirmed her feeling, and then ruthlessly shattered it. Angry at his disappointment, she coldly announced the meeting&#39;s decision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;鈥︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Ah, he seems to be a wall-facer!&quot; Then the child&#39;s parents also turned to look at him, and he had no choice but to admit that he was Luo Ji.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At this time, &quot;Hawthorn Tree&quot; sounded in the car.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The car stopped, &quot;Get off.&quot; The child&#39;s father said coldly, and the eyes of the mother and child looking at him were as cold as the autumn rain outside.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Luo Ji didn&#39;t move. He wanted to hear the song.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Please go down.&quot; The man said again, and Luo Ji read the meaning in their eyes: It is not your fault that you have no ability to save the world, but it is an unforgivable sin to give the world hope and then shatter it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;鈥︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The journey went smoothly, but more than an hour later someone recognized Luo Ji, and everyone in the car unanimously asked him to get out of the car. Luo Ji argued that he had entered his credit points to buy the ticket, so of course he had the right to ride on the bus. An old man with gray hair took out two cash coins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the already unusual cash coins were thrown at him, he was kicked out of the car.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Wall-facer, what are you doing with a shovel on your back?&quot; Someone stuck his head out of the car window and asked as the car was driving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Dig your own grave,&quot; Luo Ji said, causing a burst of laughter in the car.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wall-facer, populist, and Venezuelan President Rey Diaz was stoned to death by people who knew that he was trying to fight the Trisolarans by committing suicide when he returned to his homeland after finishing facing the wall:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Rey Diaz raised his hands in the air, and with tears in his eyes called out affectionately to the crowds of people rushing towards him: &quot;Ah, my people!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The first stone thrown by his people struck him on his raised left hand, the second hit him on the chest, and the third struck him on the forehead and knocked him down. Then, people&#39;s stones flew like raindrops, and finally almost buried his lifeless body. The last stone that hit Wallfacer Rey Diaz was thrown by an old lady. She struggled to lift a stone and walked to Rey Diaz&#39;s body and said in Spanish:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Evil man, you want to kill everyone, but there is my grandson there, and you actually want to kill my grandson!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As she spoke, she tried her best and tremblingly smashed the stone in her hand onto Ray Diaz&#39;s broken head that was exposed from the pile of stones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;There are also some details where Liu Cixin’s contempt for the public can be seen, such as this passage when Shen Yufei’s husband Wei Cheng was dictating some of his experiences:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I don’t have a good impression of the tourists and pilgrims who come here. Those tourists don’t know what they are here for, they just run around taking pictures. The pilgrims, on the other hand, generally seem to be much poorer than the tourists, and they are all in a state of numbness. Intellectually inhibited state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The most ironic thing is the following paragraph describing the pessimism and despair of mankind after the destruction of Starfleet, so a hundred thousand people gathered together for a naked sex party:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The whole square is covered with white flowers, and the white particles are squirming like a pot of boiling rice porridge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Are those all human?&quot; Luo Ji asked doubtfully.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Naked people, this is a super sex party, now over a hundred thousand people and counting.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, Liu Cixin also described some of the kindness and love of common people in this book. For example, when describing the two-dimensionalization of the solar system, there is this paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On a magnified screen pulled out by the spacecraft&#39;s A.I., a couple can be seen embracing and falling into the plane. The two-dimensional human bodies are arranged side by side on the plane. The embrace can still be seen, but the posture is very strange. Like a clumsy drawing by a child who doesn&#39;t understand the principles of perspective. There was also a mother who held her infant child high and fell into the plane. The child only lived 0.1 second longer than she did in the three-dimensional world. Their bodies were also vividly printed on this giant painting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;But such depictions are rare (this is a bit exaggerated, the only one that seems to portray the public in a positive light is the paragraph above), and most depictions of civilians are derogatory. It should also be noted that Liu Cixin&#39;s praise from the public only refers to his love for family members, not his altruism and public service in the public sphere. Although this is a statement of certain facts, it can also reflect Liu Cixin&#39;s conservative thoughts and stance (valuing the traditional family and ignoring the public sphere are typical characteristics of conservatism).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s description of the masses is in line with those academic analyzes such as &quot;The Crowd&quot; that criticize the inferiority of the masses (or &quot;the masses&quot;). There are many other literary and artistic works that express the bad nature of the public, but few are as vivid and vicious as Liu Cixin&#39;s description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These descriptions of Liu Cixin are indeed the true face of the people in many parts of the world today. In China, this inferiority of the public is more common and prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, like the previous descriptions, Liu Cixin stated the facts not with a compassionate attitude, but with pure cynicism. Liu Cixin&#39;s understanding of the public is not a profound sympathetic understanding, but a mocking understanding. This is completely different from Lu Xun&#39;s kind of strong criticism of the bad nature of the people, but full of grief, anger, sympathy, goodwill, and good intentions. The nature and direction are completely different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Another important point is that what Liu Cixin depicts is the future world, and the scene he sets is especially the human world after the &quot;Great Depression&quot; era. In many cases, it is very developed, and the people are kind and qualified. In such a society, there should be a civil society similar to that in Western developed countries, and the people should also have a certain quality of political participation. But Liu Cixin did not describe any public with civic qualities, nor did he describe civil society (only a few mentioned similar things, such as citizens throwing tomatoes at congressmen, or being derogatory). On the contrary, there are many heroic characters in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. Of course, this can also be justified by the harsh censorship environment. However, according to Liu Cixin&#39;s value orientation in this book and on other occasions, it is basically &quot;it is not impossible, it is not possible.&quot; Even without strict censorship of speech, he would still not be able to write about civil society, or in other words, he would not be able to write about the &quot;goodness&quot; of civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Liu Cixin and his &quot;Three-Body Problem&quot;: the Coexistence of Conscience Pollution and Grandeur Deep（2）</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;(Continued from Part 1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This again resonates wildly with Liu Cixin’s fans. On China’s Internet platforms, the most reviled people are 「white leftists」. Not only environmentalists and animal rights activists will be regarded as &quot;white left&quot;, but those who advocate increasing social welfare, taxing the rich, racial equality, women&#39;s rights and LGBT rights, accepting immigrants, abolition of the death penalty... will all be labeled as &quot;white left&quot; The name. Socialists regard social equality and fraternity as enemies. They believe that these policies in the name of &quot;love&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; have obliterated the value of survival of the fittest through natural selection and led to the degradation of people and society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin created the image of an extreme environmentalist and animal activist like Evans to convey the idea that the &quot;white left&quot; is causing harm to the human world. Of course, he also created Cheng Xin, a more typical &quot;white left&quot; who is very caring but prone to corruption, which will be discussed later. It is true that I am personally opposed to extreme environmentalists and animal rights activists, and cannot agree with some of the values 鈥嬧€媋 nd behaviors of the so-called &quot;white left&quot;. However, Liu Cixin&#39;s deliberate exaggeration of generalizations and extreme examples to imply universality is even more disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is a quote from an ETO member in the book that is worth pondering:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;This is not a rumor!&quot; a European said loudly, pushing forward at the same time, &quot;My name is Rafael, an Israeli. Three years ago, my fourteen-year-old son encountered a car accident, and I donated the child&#39;s kidney to A Palestinian girl suffering from uremia, to express my wish for the two peoples to coexist peacefully. For this wish, I would even sacrifice my life, and many Israelis and Palestinians are also doing the same thing. I made the same sincere efforts. But it was all in vain. Our homeland was still sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of retribution. This made me lose faith in mankind and join the Trisolaran organization. Despair turned me from a pacifist to a pacifist. As an extremist, it may also be because of my huge donation to the organization that I was able to enter the core of the Adventists. Now I tell you, the Adventists have their own secret program, which is: human beings are an evil species, and human civilization They have committed a heinous crime against the earth and must be punished for it. The ultimate goal of the Adventists is to ask the Lord to carry out this divine punishment: the destruction of all mankind!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In Liu Cixin&#39;s view (or what he wants readers to think), if those who strongly pursue world peace and beauty cannot achieve such goals, they will turn to disgusting humanity and try to destroy everything out of despair and anger. Therefore, these advocates of love and The peaceful &quot;white left&quot; are essentially potential terrorists, and they can do more harm than ordinary bad guys who seek self-interest and have low morals. And some &quot;white left&quot; persistent and firm beliefs, passionate emotions, and behaviors that do not hesitate to change reality will be regarded by Liu Cixin and others as madness or a precursor to madness, as destroyers of order or outright lunacy. It should be alerted, extinguished and destroyed. As for the &quot;white leftists&quot; like Evans and Rafael who are rich and have the ability to more actively put their ideals into practice, Liu Cixin and others believe that they should be vigilant and extinguished because these people are more realistically dangerous. In the book, the tragic collective deaths of Evans and the &quot;Adventists&quot; in &quot;Operation Guzheng&quot; revealed Liu&#39;s resentment towards the &quot;White Left&quot;. Even though Liu Cixin does not believe that Bai Zuo will destroy the world, he believes that Bai Zuo&#39;s various behaviors and tendencies will eventually objectively lead to the destruction of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course this is not the case for the &quot;white left&quot; in the real world, or at least most of them are not like this. Although there are many left-wingers who go to extremes, they are very marginalized, such as the Japanese Red Army, Red Brigades, ETA, and some particularly extreme (especially violent) environmental and animal rights activists who resort to violence for their extreme ideals. , completely cannot represent the mainstream left that advocates transformationalism, love and peace above all else. As for the &quot;left&quot; or idealistic radicals like Marxism-Leninism-Mao, their values 鈥嬧€媋 nd behaviors are obviously very different from the &quot;white left&quot; described by Liu Cixin, and there is no comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, the mainstream left will indeed be disappointed and even despair after being unable to solve the ugliness of human beings after continuous efforts, and will also breed a mood of &quot;just destroy the world&quot;, but this mood does not mean that they will really choose this in reality. . Just like when you have conflicts with others or encounter grievances, it is normal for you to want to kill the other person or break the relationship for a certain period of time (or just a thought for a few seconds), but most of them will calm down and it is impossible to actually practice it. . Just like Lu Xun often made ugly and despairing remarks about human nature, and also said, &quot;If you don&#39;t explode in silence, you will perish in silence.&quot; But does he really want people to destroy the world? No, on the contrary, he is calling on people to firmly pursue truth, goodness, beauty, fairness and justice. The &quot;white left&quot; are generally very concerned about the issue of climate warming and preventing its deterioration. If they really want to destroy mankind out of despair and think the world is dirty, or feel that the destruction of mankind is not a pity, then they should advocate giving up saving climate warming in order to expect some The land will be submerged in the next year, and the high temperature will heat humans to death. Moreover, with the development of the times and social progress, the left or &quot;white left&quot; has become more and more moderate. After some extreme attempts failed in the 20th century, they now choose a more eclectic and rational way to solve problems, without seeking absolute perfection. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(6) Dark Forest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;The Law of the Dark Forest&quot; is the theme of Liu Cixin&#39;s second part of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and directly expresses his socialist philosophy. The so-called &quot;dark forest&quot; means that people (or the entire human civilization) are in a limited and dark space, and there is a life-and-death competition between people (or planets and planets). In order to compete for living space and eliminate potential threats, these people (planets) are trying their best to get rid of or conquer each other. He also highlighted the &quot;Dark Forest Law&quot; by describing star fleets fighting among themselves to compete for resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s dark forest theory is obviously not mainly to explain the relationship between planets, but to metaphorically refer to the relationship between people, ethnic groups, and countries. Although Liu Cixin once denied this in an interview with him, he did not mean what he said. The content described and the values 鈥嬧€媝 romoted by Liu Cixin in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; are all metaphors for the real world and human society, rather than science fiction for the sake of science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Values 鈥嬧€媗 ike Liu Cixin&#39;s, which pit different people or groups against each other, regard competition as a zero-sum game, and believe that only by annihilating or conquering the other party can one be safe, are different from those that prevailed around the world from two or three centuries ago to the middle of the last century (and were once popular in China). Social Darwinism, which is popular among academic circles, has a lot in common. In today&#39;s world, although this theory is no longer publicly recognized in temples, it is popular everywhere. From Russia to India, from Nigeria to Indonesia, socialist trends of thought exist in the form of nationalism and populism. In China, it generally exists in the form of respecting power and institutions, discriminating and bullying the weak among compatriots, and is closer to the true nature of social Darwinism: bullying of the weak and survival of the fittest. For example, Zhihu, a forum where China&#39;s elite groups gather, is a stronghold of socialism and a gathering place for fans of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and Liu Cixin himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The fundamental flaw of the &quot;Dark Forest Law&quot; is that it ignores mutual assistance and cooperation between people or groups of people, spreads civilized goodwill, ignores the existence of moral, right and wrong, and humanitarian factors, and ignores the possibility that there will be better values 鈥嬧€嬧€嬧€媋 nd ways to improve the status quo in the future. possibility (Liu even strongly opposes this improvement in the book, for reasons that will be mentioned in the next section), ignores the necessity of pursuing humanity, equality, and mutual trust, and treats interpersonal, interethnic, and international relations as completely inhumane The cold and naked interest relationship replaces the rationality and sensibility of human nature with mechanistic rationality, which is not completely consistent with the reality of interpersonal, inter-ethnic and international relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, I do not mean to deny that there are games, confrontations or even zero-sum aspects in interpersonal, inter-ethnic and international relations, nor do I deny that there is widespread intrigue, insidiousness and violence in relevant relations (even on the contrary, I am quite sure that these exist, and Its dominant role in human social relations in history and reality). Typical examples include the nuclear deterrence between the United States, the Soviet Union, India, Pakistan and other countries, as well as among the world&#39;s nuclear powers, which is the realistic version of &quot;dark forest deterrence&quot;. In real life, there are also situations where various parties, from officials to ordinary employees, hold each other&#39;s &quot;dark materials&quot; to threaten each other. There are often gains and losses in games and struggles between people based on strength, unknowns, scheming, etc. It can be said that many situations in the &quot;dark forest&quot; have already occurred between countries, groups, and people on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, this is not all, just a part and an aspect. More importantly, evil is a reality, but it does not mean that it is reasonable and should be, let alone that such evil should be promoted. Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; amplifies this aspect into all social relations, and affirms it as the basis of survival and the criterion of game, and implies that only by being so evil, losing humanity and abandoning warmth can human civilization be preserved. This is poisoning people&#39;s hearts, destroying goodwill and trust, stopping people from exploring a more reasonable way to resolve disputes and living life, and leading people really into a social environment guided by the dark forest law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, we cannot deny the objective existence of this situation and cannot abandon the necessity of using chips to retain deterrence capabilities. This is indeed the nest of the &quot;dark forest&quot;, but we cannot completely escape from this reality. Only flowers protected by swords and shields can bloom for a long time. However, we should not get completely lost and indulged in this &quot;dark forest&quot;-style social relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(7) The two periods after the Great Trough to the destruction of Starfleet and the late Deterrence Era&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These two years were described by Liu Cixin as very beautiful, with abundant material resources, social harmony, and full respect for human rights and freedoms. For example, a highly humanized lifestyle brought about by full automation and digitalization; condemnation and termination of human rights violations, abuse of power, and lack of supervision caused by the &quot;Wall-Facing Project&quot;; financial compensation can be obtained for accidents in life; banks Provide generous and huge deposit interest for hibernators... In short, let people live comfortably and with dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, all of this is an attempt to suppress the situation, or to pave the way for the tragedy that will follow. At this time in Liu&#39;s writing, people have become overconfident in human civilization, and as a result, they have developed too much sympathy and empathy, and have lost their vigilance and crisis awareness, which ultimately led to the subsequent destruction of the Starfleet and the The agony of human despair before the Era of Deterrence. The depiction of the later era of deterrence (when deterrence fails) is also similar. Here are some typical paragraphs for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Before the Starfleet came into contact with the &quot;water droplets&quot; sent by Trisolaris, there was this description:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;The public&#39;s feelings towards Trisolaris have begun to shift from hostility and hatred to sympathy, pity and even admiration. People are also aware of the fact that the ten water drops of Trisolaris were emitted two centuries ago, and humans have not until now Only then can we truly understand their meaning. This is certainly because the behavior of the Trisolaran civilization is too implicit, but also reflects the mentality of human beings distorted by their own bloody history. In the global online referendum, the support rate of the Sunshine Project It has risen sharply, and more and more people are leaning toward using Mars as a strong survival option for Trisolaran settlement.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;This passage reflects the fundamental change in mankind&#39;s views on the Three-Body Problem and the Three-Body World after the end of the Great Trough and the &quot;Second Enlightenment/Renaissance/Great Revolution&quot; and &quot;giving civilization to the years.&quot; The reason for this transformation is precisely the product of its own material wealth, military power, and ideological civilization. The changes in the human condition and the re-civilization of society have turned humans from fear, hostility and high vigilance towards the Trisolaran world to one of sympathy and compassion. The human mentality at this time was in sharp contrast to the despair that occurred later when the interstellar fleet was almost completely annihilated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Take this description of the attitude of officials at a government meeting in Shi Qiang&#39;s region as an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;This was a meeting of the community government. District administrative officials were present. About two-thirds were hibernators, and the rest were modern humans. They can now be clearly distinguished: although they are all in an extremely depressed state, the hibernators The former officials maintained their normalcy in a low mood, while modern people showed more or less signs of collapse. Since the beginning of the meeting, their emotions had been out of control many times, and Shi Xiaoming&#39;s words once again touched their fragile nerves. The chief executive of the district covered his face with tears and started crying again, causing several other modern officials to cry with him; the official in charge of regional education laughed hysterically, and one modern man roared in pain, Throwing the cup on the ground...&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;This is true even for officials, let alone common people. Later, there are descriptions of tens of thousands of people engaging in collective fornication and Luo Ji being first worshiped and then expelled, etc., which reflects the despair of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The ups and downs of human mentality from despair to confidence and then to despair are saddening. The &quot;compassion&quot; for the Trisolaran world when we were confident has also become a huge joke, a cruel irony that humans have placed on themselves. He speculated on his opponent with good intentions, but ended up facing destruction. The destruction of the Earth Fleet was largely due to human beings&#39; underestimation and credulity. This kind of credulity also comes from the fact that people have lived in civilization for a long time, have lost their vigilance to the dangers of the universe, and think that their enemies are too beautiful and benevolent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s satire on human beings who are kind but deceived and whose good intentions lead to disasters does not end here. On the contrary, the human beings in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; have repeated such a tragedy since then, which is the period of history that occurred in the later period of the Deterrence Era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After the destruction of the Earth fleet and the remaining fleets killing each other, mankind was already in despair and was just waiting for the earth to be invaded and mankind to perish without being able to reproduce. However, scientist and wall-facer Luo Ji cleverly used the &quot;Snow Project&quot; to set up a system that transmits the location of the solar system and the Trisolaran galaxy to the universe, and successfully forced Trisolaran to give up its invasion of the Earth. After that, the Trisolaran and the Earth reached a peace agreement. The Earth and the Trisolaran transferred their advanced knowledge to each other, allowing the Earth to set up several deterrence systems that can launch &quot;spells&quot; that can lead to strikes in the dark forest. The two sides achieved a similar &quot;nuclear deterrence&quot; &quot;balance. Humanity finally turned the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, after deterrence was established and security returned, humans became &quot;restless&quot; again. Cheng Xin hibernated in AD 61 and woke up in 61 AD. When she woke up, she saw someone on TV denouncing Luo Ji for being involved in the &quot;crime of world genocide.&quot; Immediately afterwards, she was embraced by the public as the &quot;sword bearer&quot;. One of the reasons why the public supports her is that they are afraid of a ruthless sword holder like Luo Ji, and they are afraid of the absolute power that Luo Ji represents:&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Luo Ji&#39;s image changed from a savior day by day to an unreasonable monster and a tyrant who destroyed the world.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. People have shifted from focusing on solving basic survival problems to focusing on human rights and opposing totalitarian rule. Therefore, it is necessary to replace people like Luo Ji (not to mention &quot;barbaric&quot; AD people like Wade and Cao Bin) and choose a kind-hearted woman like Cheng Xin who represents love and peace to take on this deterrence task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As this description says:&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Look, she is the Virgin Mary, she really is!&quot; the young mother shouted to the crowd, then turned to Cheng Xin, clasping her hands with tears in her eyes, &quot;Beautiful and kind-hearted Virgin, protect this world, don&#39;t let those barbaric monsters Bloody men destroy everything beautiful.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;People have forgotten the tragedy of the destruction of the Earth Fleet, and the pursuit of beauty and kindness once again exceeds the importance of survival and safety. After the handover between the old and new sword holders, Luo Ji was also arrested for the crime of &quot;world genocide&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Just fifteen minutes after Cheng Xin held the button to emit the gravitational wave signal that should be emitted as a deterrent in the event of an invasion from the Trisolaran world, the Trisolaran &quot;water droplet&quot; pounced on the transmitter. Unable to face the consequences of the destruction of the two planets, Cheng Xin gave up on launching the gravitational wave signal that would lead to the exposure and destruction of the two galaxies. The invasion of the Three-Body Problem was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, people who showed up for a long time did not show any particular panic. When Trisolaris asked people to immigrate to Australia, there was no response.&lt;strong&gt;「Until this time, people still imagined a peaceful life for at least one generation, so after Tomoko&#39;s speech was published, no country responded, and no one started to immigrate. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;Human beings still had an ostrich mentality of taking chances. It wasn&#39;t until &quot;water droplets&quot; hit several cities, killing more than 300,000 people, that people began to migrate in fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, people&#39;s luck mentality has not been completely shattered. People also believe what Tomoko said,&lt;strong&gt;&quot;After the Trisolaran fleet arrives, it is fully capable of enabling the four billion people in Australia to live a comfortable life. At the same time, the occupiers will also help humans build living spaces on Mars and in space. Five years after the fleet arrives, it will be able to send people to Mars and large-scale space immigration will be basically completed in fifteen years. By then, humans will have a relatively large enough living space, and the two civilizations will start a new peaceful life in the solar system.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, the Trisolaran World does not give humans a chance to survive. Instead, it gradually destroys humans&#39; ability to resist and survive. Destroy Australian industry and infrastructure as people disarm and emigrate. Then, they cut off electricity and agricultural production capacity and forced &quot;people to eat each other.&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Tomoko looked around at all the people in the hall, &quot;Food?&quot; Isn’t this all food? Everyone, look around you. There is food, living food. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;Only then did human beings know what a life-and-death struggle was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This passage from Sophon&#39;s mouth can reflect Liu Cixin&#39;s views on human survival issues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Survival is inherently a kind of luck. This was true on the earth in the past, and it is true everywhere in this cold universe now. But I don&#39;t know since when, human beings have an illusion that survival has become something within easy reach. This is you The root cause of failure. The flag of evolution will rise again in this world, and you will fight for survival. I hope everyone here is among the last 50 million people. I hope you can eat food instead of Eaten by grain.」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The process of human ups and downs described by Liu Cixin is shocking. The compassion he depicts when humans are safe and happy, the relaxation of vigilance, the despair and madness of humans when they are on the verge of extinction, and the ingenious design of the Three-Body Problem to push humans into extinction step by step, all reflect the weaknesses of human nature. For example, the process of human beings being exterminated by the Three-Body Plan in Australia (the attempted extinction), and the process including the Roman massacre of Carthage and the Jingkang disaster (the Jin army conquered Kaifeng) 錛夈€乀 he processes of the Nanjing Massacre and other massacres are quite similar (you can read the relevant accounts and compare them. Perhaps Liu Cixin wrote similar plots in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; after reading these accounts). This all reflects Liu Cixin’s profound understanding and vivid interpretation of human nature, human psychology, and the cruelty of the struggle for survival in human history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In this section, I have quite a positive opinion of Liu Cixin. But this article is mainly for criticism, and of course this paragraph also needs criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In fact, the above content is the continuation and embodiment of Liu Cixin’s dark forest theory. Liu Cixin&#39;s descriptions and analyzes are indeed profound and consistent with part of human history and reality. However, as said before (and will be said many times later), while Liu Cixin accurately depicts a certain dark fact, he rationalizes this darkness, hints or even expresses the unchangeable nature of this reality, conveying A value that can survive only by giving up kindness and compassion and choosing cruelty and viciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The same facts and principles, with different emotional tendencies and description emphasis, can lead to different conclusions and achieve completely different goals. Based on Liu Cixin&#39;s description between the lines, as well as the whole book and even his personal words and deeds on other occasions, it is enough to draw the conclusion that he advocates abandoning goodwill, treating people with evil, using deceit and cruelty in interpersonal, ethnic, international relations and competitive matters. . In addition, he also wanted to express or imply other things, which will be discussed later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When describing this part of the content, there is also an intriguing passage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Some scholars believe that science and technology were once one of the forces that eliminated totalitarianism, but when a crisis threatens the survival of civilization, science and technology may become the soil for the birth of new totalitarianism. In traditional totalitarianism, dictators can only be controlled through other people. Achieving rule faces low efficiency and countless uncertain factors. Therefore, in human history, a 100% dictatorship system has never appeared. But technology has made it possible for the realization of this super dictatorship. Wall-facers and persistence Swordsmen are worrying examples. The combination of super technology and super crisis may push human society back to the Dark Ages.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is difficult to judge what Liu Cixin actually meant by this statement. According to Liu Cixin&#39;s usual political views, he is not opposed to totalitarianism in China today. However, the situation described in this passage is very similar to the reality in China in the past ten years. This passage accurately discusses the evolution of the relationship between technology and totalitarianism. When the Internet emerged, people thought it would break the information blockade and promote freedom and democracy. However, now technological totalitarianism and digital totalitarianism have been established in many countries, including China, and even democratic countries cannot escape the specter of surveillanceism. The high-intensity control that authoritarian countries such as China are using technology to carry out during the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the centralized and digital management that countries must adopt to curb climate warming in the future, are both highly consistent with Liu Cixin’s words that 「threaten the survival of civilization.」 When a crisis occurs, technology may become the soil for the birth of a new totalitarianism.&quot; So does Liu Cixin agree with this kind of technological totalitarianism? This is a question that is not easy to judge, or Liu does not simply agree or disagree with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(8) Thomas Wade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The creation of this character best reflects Liu Cixin&#39;s social Darwinism thoughts, and can also give a glimpse of Liu Cixin&#39;s standards for judging human quality and value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Thomas Vader&#39;s first words after appearing on the scene were shocking enough:&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Would you sell your mother to a brothel?&quot; Wade asked&lt;/strong&gt;(Ask Cheng Xin). Through this shocking sentence and side description, the image of a cold and cruel intelligence agent is portrayed, and it also reveals Vader&#39;s sinister character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;To achieve the goal by any means is a typical feature of social Darwinism. Liu Cixin said it powerfully through the words of Wade:&lt;strong&gt;He suddenly changed his usual calm and cold tone and roared like a mad beast, &quot;Forward! Forward!! Forward by any means necessary!!!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When the plan to send humans to contact the Trisolaran world was blocked due to carrying weight restrictions, Vader said coldly, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Just send the brain&lt;/strong&gt;」銆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is also this side description:&lt;strong&gt;&quot;There were two male prisoners who were obviously from AD, and Cheng Xin whistled frivolously, but when they saw the person Cheng Xin was looking for, they immediately became more serious, and they all hurriedly lowered their heads to work, as if they were a little afraid of what they had just done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The first time Cheng Xin saw this man (Vade), she knew that he had not given up. His ambitions and ideals, his insidiousness, and many other things that Cheng Xin had never known before, he had not given up on anything. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, these alone cannot fully portray Vader&#39;s ruthlessness. Liu Cixin still has more words to describe Wade. But just from these few sentences, people can understand what kind of character, image, and characteristics Vader is. Characters like Vader are not just literary figures, there are also similar real people in reality. From leaders of a country to local powerful men and gang leaders, to even ruthless and capable figures in schools and workplaces, they all fit in with certain aspects or even the entire image of Vader. When ordinary people come into contact with such a person, they will inevitably break out in cold sweat on their chest, back, head and feet, and will unconsciously become afraid of him. Even people with some spirit and ability will shrink a bit in front of such a vicious person. If you are not afraid of him at first, then after he performs some tricks on you, you will be more afraid of him than ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, characters like Vader portrayed by Liu Cixin are the saviors of mankind, or at least one of the saviors. Vader not only promoted the Ladder Plan and sent Yun Tianming&#39;s brain to the Trisolaran world, but most importantly, he researched the light speed spacecraft, allowing humans to retain the fire of life. And if it hadn&#39;t been for the &quot;destruction&quot; caused by Cheng Xin, Vader and others would have been able to bring humanity out of the danger of being two-dimensionalized, and even the Trisolaris would not have been able to break through and threaten the earth in the first place. All subsequent disasters would have will not happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin endowed a devil-like figure with angelic saving power precisely because he wanted to express what he said through Wade&#39;s mouth&lt;strong&gt;&quot;If you lose your humanity, you will lose a lot; if you lose your bestiality, you will lose everything&quot;, and &quot;advance by any means necessary&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;Or to combine the two sentences, it means that only by unscrupulous means and regardless of human nature and human rights can we win. If we care about morality and means and are bound by human nature and human rights, we can only fail. This is a typical view of Social Darwinism, or not only a view of Social Darwinism, but the most sinister aspect of Social Darwinism, that is, evil must triumph over good, and only by eliminating good and promoting evil can we survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This point is shown many times in Liu Cixin&#39;s The Three-Body Problem, and the depiction of Wade is a concentrated expression of this point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So, is this view correct? If we look at the history of mankind and even all things, this is indeed an objective reality to a large extent. Let’s not talk about anything else but human beings. In history, are there more examples of barbarism defeating civilization, or are there more examples of civilization destroying barbarism? Undoubtedly the former. Exquisite Athens perished at the hands of capable Sparta, Rome perished at the hands of barbarian invasions, and the Song and Ming dynasties perished at the hands of the Jin, Yuan, and Manchu Qing dynasties. These are all well-known examples. Even those self-proclaimed civilizations have indeed created the power of civilization. Isn&#39;t their rise and glory based on barbarism, cruelty and unscrupulous means? For ancient Rome, the treacherous massacre of the Carthaginians after they disarmed was the key to its domination of the Mediterranean; Li Shimin struck preemptively (of course, some historical data see it as a &quot;self-defense counterattack,&quot; but...) and launched the Xuanwu The Gate Incident killed Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji and his descendants, which led to the later Zhenguan rule of &quot;Tian Khan&quot;. In addition to these magnificent histories, how many examples are there in the market that &quot;good people don&#39;t live long, and bad people do harm for thousands of years&quot;? &quot;Despicability is the passport of the despicable, and nobility is the epitaph of the noble.&quot; Someone has long made an incisive and profound summary of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Therefore, what Liu Cixin said through Wade&#39;s mouth is indeed reality to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But reality does not mean what is right or what should be. On the contrary, the development of human civilization to this day has been achieved precisely through the lashing of barbarism and the overcoming of ugliness. Without criticism and restraint of evil, human beings would still attack each other day after day, and beheadings, amputations, and gunfire would still be commonplace, and it would be impossible for human beings to bask in relative peace and development. It is the persistence of countless people that allows evil to be restricted and compressed step by step. At least great evils and disasters only unfortunately happen to a small number of people in a small number of areas, while most people can live their lives in relative peace and tranquility. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Therefore, we can only &quot;abandon&quot; the extreme socialist views hinted and even promoted by Liu Cixin in The Three-Body Problem (yes, it is extreme socialist rather than ordinary socialist). We know its reality but must also curb its reality. After realizing the horror of unscrupulous means, we must stick to conscience and rationality to restrain the growth of ugliness and the rebirth of cruelty. Even if we are the products left by evil, we should not continue evil to survive. Just like to a certain extent, we are all the descendants of various acts of rape (or, to be precise, non-consensual sex) from ancient times to modern times (who dares to say that all of their ancestors were the product of consensual sexual intercourse?), we are all rapes Descendants of the crime, but we certainly should not praise rape, but resolutely criticize and despise it. The live human experiments conducted by Japan&#39;s Unit 731 and Nazi Germany have achieved great medical and scientific research results, and have benefited mankind today, but this cannot be whitewashed, beautified, justified or rationalized. , let alone allow similar atrocities to happen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin is not (or at least will not publicly admit to being) a proponent of extreme socialism, but objectively he undoubtedly implies or even expresses such a value orientation and value choice. Different from many literary and artistic works in Europe, the United States and even China that depict darkness and bad guys&#39; unscrupulous tactics, which are meant to lash out ugliness and praise justice, Liu&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; depicts darkness and unscrupulous tactics while doing everything possible to rationalize and even praise and express them. It is a tragic, great, and only understandable value and practice for the continuation of human survival and development. This is worthy of vigilance and criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Regarding Liu’s socialist values, I will criticize them later, but now I will return to my comments on Weide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s portrayal of the character Wade is also very positive. Although he depicts so many evil and sinister aspects of this man, he does so to highlight the greatness of his purpose, the correctness of his direction, and the legitimacy of his actions. Moreover, everything Vader does as described by Liu Cixin is not for Vader himself, but is related to the future and destiny of mankind. Vader has become a person who cannot be said to be &quot;not self-interested&quot; but is clearly &quot;benefiting mankind&quot; and not &quot; He is a heroic figure who is &quot;righteous&quot; but obviously &quot;clean on both sleeves&quot;. Everything he does is not for personal gain but for the public interest. Moreover, such a hero is feared by others, but he never bows to any pressure, and is not afraid to flatter anyone or even alien creatures (for example, he speaks boldly when being monitored by sophons and everyone is cautious, but deliberately takes advantage of this surveillance. ), is an out-and-out hero. This makes all his &quot;anti-humanity&quot; and &quot;anti-human rights&quot; actions look more just, selfless and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But in reality, is a person like Wade really always upright, persistent, determined, and hard-core? From some aspects or on the surface, this is indeed the case. The people I mentioned above, from the head of state to the gang leader, to the ruthless people in the school unit, are often majestic, quite powerful, capable, and fearless. But the vast majority of them (unless they are truly invincible) are often more groveling than ordinary people when facing someone who is more &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;awesome&quot;, because they know better than ordinary people how terrible their own kind is. You can&#39;t offend those who are stronger than you. In the face of the system, although they sometimes make provocative and rebellious actions to show their strength and power to others or just for their own comfort, more often they obey the system, flatter the system, and act against those with coercive power. There is an unusual piety to the systems and rules that underlie it. Because they know that the energy of the system is infinite, which individuals can use but cannot overturn. They are by no means rigid and arrogant towards anyone or anything, but because of their personality traits and survival needs, they are more bullying and fearful of the hard, adapt to the situation, and are refined and self-interested than ordinary people. People like Beria and Goering don&#39;t look like Vader? What kind of moral character did they have in front of Stalin and Hitler (of course they changed their moral character before the latter died)? Faced with the evil system and environment, will they rebel and confront, or will they submit and take advantage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, even if Thomas Vader becomes (represents) a supreme leader or dictator (rather than a thug) like Stalin, Mao Zedong, Hitler, and Putin, is he really pure and brave? According to various information now disclosed, they are often far more frightened and weak than the leaders of democratic countries. For example, Stalin showed fear when Germany invaded and before his death, and it was not true that he would never fall down even if he died. Although the movie &quot;The Death of Stalin&quot; is a bit dramatic, the facts reflected are basically correct. And what about Mao Zedong? Li Zhisui&#39;s disclosure is not an isolated evidence, but can be verified with information from multiple parties, and the sincerity of the record has been affirmed by well-known mainstream scholars such as Li Anyou. This &quot;tough guy&quot; can also be seen in Putin&#39;s behavior after his failed invasion of Ukraine. The image of Thomas Wade created by Liu Cixin is actually similar to the superficial images of these dictators, such as fortitude and courage, but he deliberately avoids the inner weakness and fear of such people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, are people like Wade really honest, selfless, and dedicated to their ideals? There are indeed such people, but they are rare. The vast majority of people who think and act like them have no less desires than ordinary people, and their abilities and means are enough to obtain more illegal benefits. How can they live clean in power, money, and beauty like Liu Xiahui? Let’s take those sanctimonious and ruthless top leaders of the Burundi Party and Nazis, such as Yagoda and Goebbels, as examples. If you look at the history books and memoirs about them, you will know that they are more dirty and blatant than the dirty people who can be seen at a glance. People who are greedy are even more greedy (of course in comparison, the Bolsheviks are more inconsistent and shamelessly greedy than the Nazis). Will they make sacrifices for the people? Maybe it will happen at some point in time, but it will definitely be after he is greedy for pleasure and uses various methods to benefit himself at the expense of others to make sacrifices. It will never be as tragic a sacrifice as in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. The collapse of the Nazis and the Soviet Union and the revelation of the inside story also proved that what they sacrificed to defend was not something worthwhile, but something downright dirty. In other words, people like Tojo Hideki and Nogi Nogi are indeed selfless, but they earned their &quot;selflessness&quot; and their devotion to Japan with the lives of tens of millions of Chinese, Americans, Russians/Soviets. The &quot;greatness&quot; of man. Do we want such people? (The most important thing is that this kind of dedication and survival is not the only way in this world)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But Liu Cixin did not describe these. Instead, he described Wade and the previous Shi Qiang as very honest, devoid of desires, not afraid, and not flattering. Of course, this can be said to be because their conduct is not the focus of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, so there is no need to write about their greed, fear, and flattery. Therefore, a cruel and cruel figure like Vader appears to be very great to mankind, and an image like Shi Qiang appears imperfect but more complete and real. If Liu Cixin writes about these people being greedy, fearful, and flattering, his good image will collapse and he will lose the set of moral conduct that Liu Cixin and the socialists think the characters should have (at least on the surface). They can no longer create the ideal hero in their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is again the way historical figures are described in today’s Chinese propaganda system. In the past, that is, the &quot;first thirty years&quot;, especially the ten years of the Cultural Revolution, all important figures and positive figures were presented in a &quot;great and upright&quot; image, without any flaws (at most, they would have a somewhat approachable description). But now it is different. For those great men, heroes, and positive figures, we will deliberately highlight some of their wild, unruly, low-quality, poor knowledge and other characteristics, but at the same time, we will never &quot;smear&quot; the &quot;major issues&quot; involving fundamental integrity. In this way Make the positive image more humane, real, and flesh-and-blood. But this kind of humanization, realness, and flesh and blood actually avoids many more important facts of evil and even crime. It uses small &quot;flaws&quot; to cover up the real filth and filth, and uses dramatic naughtiness to overcome the bloody situation. Outright brutality. I mentioned this kind of depiction earlier in this article when it came to &quot;Mao Zedong&#39;s Instructions.&quot; Liu&#39;s depiction of characters like Weide and Shi Qiang is in the same vein, as are his attitudes and motivations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Characters like Wade portrayed by Liu Cixin, and other related descriptions and narratives, all reinforce the ideas of &quot;advancing by any means necessary&quot; and &quot;losing beastliness and losing everything&quot;. Liu is not only describing an objective fact, but also giving subjective approval and praise. This is the biggest difference between him and other masterpieces of literature handed down from ancient times, and it is also the most worthy of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, as mentioned before, the characters like Wade and Shi Qiang depicted by Liu Cixin represent the violent machines of the ruling institutions (or one of them) and are the defenders of the system, not Lin Chong and Yang. Rebels of the system like Zhi Zhi and Lu Zhishen, and those who oppose the state’s violent machine. In &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, Liu Cixin criticized Ye Wenjie and other victims and rebels, but he did not hesitate to praise the defenders of the human order. This can also reflect Liu Cixin&#39;s conservative nature and the conservative stance of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; . They are indeed social Darwinists, but their social Darwinism is not for change, but for the purpose of making the old order more stable. This further demonstrates the ugliness and reactionary nature of Liu Cixin and the values 鈥嬧€媜 f &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What is very ironic is that Liu Cixin and &quot;Three-Body&quot;&#39;s conservative reaction to defend the system and the old order is in sharp contrast to the anti-traditional and anti-order ideas held by Mao Zedong that they praised. Liu Cixin has repeatedly praised Mao Zedong (or at least mentioned it without being disparaging and critical) in her books and interviews. Mao Zedong’s crimes are too numerous to list, and the Cultural Revolution was an unprecedented catastrophe. However, there is one redeeming feature, which is his resistance to systemic oppression and his rebellion against traditional order and ideology (although this process and subsequent establishment of a bad system and more tyrannical The order has also resulted in more cruel oppression, but after all, it is a rebellion and rebellion against the unreasonable and even ugly old rules, orders, and orthodoxies), a spirit of resistance that breaks the shackles of the old nest. This can be said to be the only bright spot in the brutal Cultural Revolution during the Mao era. Liu Cixin has repeatedly lauded Mao Zedong and cleared away the perpetrators of the Cultural Revolution and related systems and organizations, but it runs counter to Maoism and the only admirable thing about the Cultural Revolution. It can be seen how &quot;coincidentally&quot; it is completely contrary to the trend of humanitarianism and progress. How highly consistent with the ugly reactionary conservatism.&lt;/p&gt;

Its success is not only that Chinese works have historically won the Hugo Award, the highest award in the world of science fiction, but also that it has illuminated, inspired and announced a generation of Chinese people (or at least a large group of a certain type of Chinese people) in the world. (a specific period of time) has achieved a broad and deep resonance among Chinese people, especially young people. The author Liu Cixin has also become a super idol among fans of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, and his worship and maintenance have reached a level that is unmatched by any other contemporary writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have read &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; many times myself, and I can basically read it without missing a word or neglecting any plot, and I was deeply impressed. I also have a limited but relatively sufficient understanding of the author Liu Cixin’s background, remarks, and values. The relevant conclusions should be mentioned at the end of this article, but I don’t know when this article will be completed, and I need to give a rough evaluation first. Therefore, I will first make an overall evaluation of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; and Liu Cixin at the beginning of this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The book &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is a sci-fi story about the struggle between humans and alien civilizations. It reflects some essential characteristics of human nature and human society, as well as reflections on the history and reality of humans and even the universe, and predictions of the future. It has rich literary content. , scientific and philosophical thinking, showing the author&#39;s profound insight, imagination, and powerful ability to construct, metaphor and express what he reveals through science fiction. However, the work and the author&#39;s emotional tendencies and implied value orientation are generally social Darwinism, non-sympathetic, non-human and non-philanthropic, and depreciate progressivism and social justice. The author&#39;s personal character and moral integrity are also very problematic. The quality of this work can be ranked among the thousands of literary works of great value, inspiration and influence in the world from ancient times to the present. However, the values 鈥嬧€嬧€嬧€媡 hat it implies and guides, the moral values 鈥嬧€嬧€嬧€媋 nd the humanistic spirit it contains are completely incomparable with those By comparison, it is even said to be a negative and harmful moral and humanistic value. This is my rough evaluation. More specific evaluations will be written in the middle and at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is vast and densely packed with details, so naturally I cannot recapitulate it here. Therefore, I write this book review on the assumption that the reviewer has read The Three-Body Problem in its entirety. However, I will still include some background and plot introduction in the review, such as quoting the original text of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, so that this article can be understood by those who have not read (at least not read it carefully) &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. For the convenience of writing, I will order the characters and events in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; in the order they are mentioned in the book, use these characters and events as units to discuss and analyze, and provide appropriate summary and review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I will make a lot of comments on the emotions and motivations of Liu Cixin&#39;s writing content in the article. Of course, this kind of judgment cannot have &quot;conclusive&quot; evidence in the legal sense. Instead, it relies heavily on speculation and association. Moreover, this kind of judgment cannot be 100% consistent with Liu Cixin&#39;s original intention, and no one has such ability, unless someone can detect what Liu Cixin is thinking in his brain. There are also many judgments based on the objective influence and reader response of Liu Cixin and his &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. The meaning expressed by a work largely depends on the meaning considered by the mainstream among readers who have the right to express freely (especially when the author has the ability to deny it but does not deny it, or denies it but does not follow logic). The relationship between the author and the readers, the work and the response is an interactive relationship, rather than a one-way infusion of meaning. The author should also consider what impact it will have when writing, including what he thinks is a &quot;misreading.&quot; Therefore, I will use its recognition and influence on readers to infer the content and emotions of Liu Cixin in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. This is not to intentionally wrong him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, as a critical article, this article is of course mainly focused on criticism. Even if I agree with some of Liu Cixin’s views, I will not mention them in a large space. It won’t take much effort to deal with some of the less controversial characters created by Liu Cixin (or at least I don’t think there is any particular need to criticize), such as Zhang Beihai, Luo Ji and others, as well as some events and plots that have no special symbolic meaning. pen and ink. Most of what I write is the objectionable part. On the whole, as mentioned above, I praise his &quot;ability&quot; to criticize his &quot;virtue&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(1) Shi Qiang&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The first character to appear in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is the scientist Wang Miao, but the first character to be portrayed in detail is the policeman Shi Qiang who comes to interview Wang Miao. In just a few pages, a rough, savage, and invasive character is portrayed. Fans who are familiar with &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; will certainly know that the description of Shi Qiang in the opening chapter and similar descriptions in the following are all foreshadowing Shi Qiang&#39;s shrewdness, courage, and sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Or to be more precise, Liu Cixin deliberately linked cunning and stubbornness with competence and responsibility, implying that characters with gangster habits are often &quot;cold on the outside and hot on the inside&quot; and are essentially good people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By excerpting the description of Shi Qiang in the novel, we can see what kind of values 鈥嬧€婰 iu Cixin wants to express and try to instill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At the beginning of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, when Shi Qiang and Wang Miao met:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(Wang Miao said) &quot;&#39;Science Frontier&#39; is an academic organization that is very influential in the international academic community, and its members are all famous scholars. Why can&#39;t I get in touch with such a legitimate academic organization?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Look at you!&quot; Shi Qiang said loudly, &quot;Did we say it&#39;s illegal? Did we say we wouldn&#39;t let you come into contact with it?&quot; As he spoke, the smoke he had just inhaled was sprayed into Wang Miao&#39;s face. superior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;鈥︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;I have the right not to answer, so please do as you please.&quot; Wang Miao said and turned to go back to the house.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Wait!&quot; Shi Qiang said sternly, waving to the young police officer next to him, &quot;Give him his address and phone number, and go for a walk in the afternoon.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And it was this person who, when Wang Miao was almost committed suicide after being hit by the illusion created by the Trisolarans, he used a clever method to encourage Wang Miao to have the courage to live, and cheered up to participate in the crackdown on the Earth Trisolaran organization. (ETO) conspiracy. Later, Shi Qiang also made a clever plan (namely &quot;Operation Guzheng&quot;) to ambush Evans and the &quot;Judgment Day&quot;, and rescued and protected another scientist Luo Ji many times, which can be said to be a great contribution. In addition, Liu Cixin also described Shi Qiang&#39;s deep friendship with Wang Miao and Luo Ji. It was with Shi Qiang&#39;s encouragement that Wang Miao regained the courage to live, and helped the government and military police solve a series of crimes committed by the &quot;Earth Trisolaran Organization&quot;; for Luo Ji, Shi Qiang was a close friend and always protected him. Luo Ji, and pushed him from being bohemian to taking the responsibility of defending mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At the beginning, we saw the image of Shi Qiang, which looked very much like a real evil policeman who abused his police power and oppressed the people. The book does list his bad deeds: ignoring the safety of the hostages when handling hostage-taking incidents, inciting gangsters to take advantage of others, and extorting confessions through torture... Such a &quot;evil policeman&quot; saved an important scientist, and thus saved the fate of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s implication here is that morality is not important, but talent is the first; it doesn&#39;t matter if you abuse your power or violate laws and disciplines, the most important thing is to be &quot;useful&quot;. Moreover, although such people are cruel to strangers and enemies, they can still treat friends with sincerity. Furthermore, Liu&#39;s Chunqiu style of writing implies that it is precisely evil people like Shi Qiang who have cunning, courage, and talent that ordinary people do not have, but people who are polite and law-abiding cannot do so. It is easy to draw an inference from this: people should tolerate evil people and evil policemen and tolerate their illegal behavior, because only people who have experienced ugliness and are full of gangsters have the ability to protect us. Perhaps, this is what Liu Cixin wants to convey to us. This is not an isolated case in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. There are also some characters later, such as Thomas Wade, who can prove Liu&#39;s subtle hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Throughout the book, there are many positive descriptions of Shi Qiang, such as the aforementioned friendship with Wang Miao and Luo Ji, which is very touching. Liu Cixin tried to strengthen Shi Qiang&#39;s gangster color and chivalrous heart, so that people can form an impression that this kind of person who looks bad (actually has an obviously bad side) is essentially good, and people should understand, Tolerate, appreciate, and praise them. This is a bit like the description of those heroes in &quot;Water Margin&quot; who are both chivalrous and murderous. However, the &quot;heroes&quot; in Water Margin are those who are anti-system and anti-power. Liu Cixin&#39;s Shi Qiang and Thomas Wade are both members of the ruling class who wear official clothes and maintain order. They are also part of the violent machine. &quot;Water Margin&quot; celebrates the spirit of resistance, while &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; praises the &quot;spirit of oppression.&quot; Regardless of Liu Cixin&#39;s subjective intentions, objectively it is a fact that he cleared the ground for members of the state&#39;s powerful departments. Most literary writers will denounce the barbarity of violent machines and the filth of the ruling class in their words (including the gangster novel &quot;Once Upon a Time in the Northeast&quot;, which is not high in style, first talks about the corruption of the cadre class and even the regime&#39;s suppression of democratic protests, and then Talking about gang violence in civil society), only people like Liu Cixin can change the law and sing praises for the system and its attachments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Another description of Shi Qiang not only once again enriches the image of Shi Qiang as a &quot;rogue police hero&quot;, but also reveals Liu Cixin&#39;s stigma and resentment towards the relatively marginalized and unfortunate family victims in society. There is a scene in the book when Shi Qiang and the military police raided an ETO meeting and encountered a young girl threatening a bomb:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Stop.&quot; The nuclear bomb girl warned Da Shi with a wink, her right thumb pressed tightly on the detonation switch, and her nail polish shone in the flashlight light.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Take it easy, girl, there&#39;s something you definitely want to know.&quot; Da Shi stood seven or eight meters away from the girl and took out an envelope from his pocket, &quot;Your mother has been found.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The girl&#39;s bright eyes immediately dimmed, but at this time, these eyes really led to her soul.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Da Shi took the opportunity and took two more steps forward, shortening the distance between himself and the girl to about five meters. The girl alertly raised a nuclear bomb and stopped him with her eyes, but her attention had been greatly distracted. One of the two people who just threw away the fake nuclear bomb walked towards Da Shi and reached for the envelope he was holding. Da Shi pulled out his pistol like lightning. His action of drawing the gun was just blocked by the person who took the letter. The girl did not see it. She only saw a light flash in the ear of the recipient of the letter, and the nuclear bomb in her arms was hit and exploded.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;鈥︹€&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Who is that girl?&quot; Wang Miao asked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Da Shi grinned, &quot;How the hell do I know? I&#39;m just guessing. A girl like this has probably never seen her mother. I&#39;ve been in this business for more than 20 years, and I&#39;ve learned how to read people.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In Liu Cixin&#39;s writings, people who attempt to undermine the current order and use extreme means to fight against mainstream society are often victims of society and marginalized groups (of course, this is objectively true). Moreover, from the evaluation and tone of the girl spoken by Shi Qiang above, it can be seen that Liu Cixin does not sympathize with her but despise and dislike her. This tone is like that used in conservative societies towards women who have been sexually assaulted. Instead of expressing deep sympathy, they think the victim is &quot;dirty&quot;. In the eyes of Liu Cixin and others, these extremes, troublemakers, and those who resist order are poor and hateful bugs who have been abandoned by their families and are &quot;motherless.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And this is very consistent with the values 鈥嬧€嬧€嬧€媢 nder the current wave of Darwinism in Chinese society. Whenever an extreme incident occurs in society, the Internet is full of voices saying &quot;I don&#39;t want to know what he went through, I just want him to die.&quot; It seems that the guilty person is not Cai Jinggaoqiu, but Yang Zhilinchong (strictly speaking, of course) Yang Zhilinchong is indeed guilty). As for those poor people who protested peacefully and petitioned through formal channels, people looked on with indifference and even took schadenfreude. It’s not that they don’t know the suffering of these victims, but they despise and reject them from above. Not only do they not feel that they have to bear some responsibility and participate in some necessary changes in society, they also feel that these disadvantaged people are an eyesore and influence on them. own mood. The popularity of Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is due to the resonance between the lines and the socialist and self-interested mentality of the middle and upper classes. (Of course, I don’t agree with hurting innocent people, and I believe that once you do something like this, you need to take responsibility regardless of the reason and cannot escape guilt. However, it is necessary to discuss the reasons and solve the problem, even if it eases the conflict, rather than just relying on Violent coercion, killing and rebound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Characters like Shi Qiang in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, there are also many gods-like images in European, American, Japanese and Korean literature and film and television works, that is, a person who seems to be not decent (or indeed not decent) but is in important matters and life and death. Guan Guan showed extraordinary courage and sense of responsibility to reflect the complexity and brilliance of human nature. However, after careful analysis and experience, you will find that the images and purposes of shaping Shi Qiang, Thomas Wade, Luo Ji, etc. in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; are actually different from most European, American, Japanese and Korean works. The latter (such as the seemingly similar characters depicted in the novels of Chekhov, Maupassant, Hugo, and Balzac) is to reflect the complexity of human nature and the glory of justice, while the former is more like whitewashing the powerful and the evil. Giving money to the oppressors and vested interests. This can be reasonably analyzed and speculated through the emotional tendencies between the lines, detailed descriptions, the overall environment, and even the author&#39;s creative background and possible purposes. Of course, the readers&#39; own values 鈥嬧€媋 nd experiences will also cause different feelings. At least some people who have read Chinese and foreign literature, film and television works will have this resonance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For example, Hugo&#39;s most famous work &quot;Les Mis 茅 rables&quot; depicts the character of Jean Valjean as a &quot;criminal&quot;. But Hugo did not describe Jean Valjean as disgusting as the &quot;Bomb Girl&quot;. On the contrary, he portrayed Jean Valjean as quite sympathetic. Sheriff Javert, who enforces the law and arrests Jean Valjean, is not as &quot;cool&quot; and admirable as Shi Qiang because of his badness. Instead, he is portrayed by Hugo in a way that makes readers feel hated. In the end, Sheriff Javert also awakened his conscience and completed the redemption together with Jean Valjean. In &quot;Les Mis 茅 rables&quot;, everyone has a clear conscience, and it is precisely because they all maintain a bottom line, and even deliberately &quot;let go of water (such as Javert letting go of Jean Valjean)&quot; when they can achieve their goals, that &quot;Les Mis 茅 rables&quot; ends with End in the light (rather than turning France and the world into a &quot;dark forest&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Maupassant&#39;s &quot;Ball of Suif&quot;, Chekhov&#39;s &quot;Wanka&quot;, and Lu Xun&#39;s &quot;Blessing&quot; all take the portrayal of a vulnerable victim as the theme of the novel, expressing deep sympathy for the person involved in every word, and describing her/ Their experiences were due to the harsh environment, especially the ruthlessness of others, which exposed the ugliness and common hypocrisy of society. More works by these three writers also have such emotional tendencies and moral stances. This is completely opposite to Liu Cixin&#39;s attitude of despising and even ridiculing the weak, praising the wicked, and praising order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is not only true for these famous works, but even some not-so-great literary and artistic works will retain a lot of basic &quot;human flavor&quot;. For example, the criminal investigation drama &quot;Serious Case Group 6&quot;, which was once popular in China, has police officers with different personalities, but they all retain a minimum of human conscience. Perhaps the image of Shi Qiang in The Three-Body Problem is more in line with the true appearance of some police officers, but it obviously should not be portrayed in a praising and encouraging manner. The police in &quot;Serious Case Group Six&quot; may be idealized, but such propaganda can also form a beneficial guidance for the police team, rather than an evil hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(2) Cultural Revolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The mention of the Cultural Revolution in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; has been regarded by some book critics as a breakthrough in contemporary literary works and has also become a major selling point of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. Some people who don&#39;t know much about the details think Liu Cixin is a great writer who dares to touch sensitive issues and reflect on history. It is speculated that the first part of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; won the Hugo Award that year, which may be related to the fact that the book dared to mention this political taboo in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Indeed, the scale of the crazy years and fighting scenes mentioned in the article is shocking. Among the best-selling literary works published in China, there are few that directly present the tragic Cultural Revolution scenes like &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. The book also describes the destruction of knowledge, the persecution of scholars, and the human tragedy of families being separated and friends betrayed under political struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, all these are just phenomena and phenomena. What&#39;s the essence? The reason? Who caused such a tragedy? Neither in the book nor in reality did Liu Cixin make any unfavorable judgments about the regime and the ruling group that led to the Cultural Revolution. While describing various phenomena during the Cultural Revolution, it completely avoids reflection and criticism on related systems, characters, and culture. There is only a statement phenomenon. This statement style and tone seem to tell people that this is a tragedy destined to happen in history, and there is no one responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If Liu Cixin&#39;s calm description of the Cultural Revolution does not fully explain his political attitude, then his attitude towards the &quot;initiators&quot; of the Cultural Revolution is enough to reflect the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In some documents about the &quot;Red Bank Base&quot; we can find a comment that clearly implies that it was written by Mao. The excerpt is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;[Instructions] have been read. This nonsense! Just post the big-character posters on the ground. Do not send them to the sky. The Cultural Revolution leading group should not intervene in Hong&#39;an in the future. Such important letters should be carefully drafted. It is best to set up a special group and organize them in It was discussed and approved at the Politburo meeting.」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And this paragraph: &quot;&lt;strong&gt;In this era, if you want to bring down a high-ranking person, you have to obtain his black materials in various fields in charge of him. However, the two-bomb project is a tricky area for conspirators. This project is under the key protection of the central government. In order to avoid the storm of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, it was difficult for them to intervene. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It&#39;s the shameful logic of &quot;it&#39;s all the people below who do bad things, the emperor is enlightened&quot; again. After the reform and opening up, the worship model that portrayed Mao Zedong as a &quot;great and righteous&quot; saint in the &quot;first thirty years&quot; ended (although it has emerged again in recent years), and was replaced by the arrangement of some anecdotes and personalized remarks of Mao. Create an approachable, far-sighted, sharp-edged image, and cleverly avoid his huge sins, so as to attract the love and even worship of those who do not know the full picture. It has to be said that this way of describing is very confusing and can capture the hearts of contemporary young people far better than the images of &quot;great righteousness&quot; and &quot;gao daquan&quot;. As for the &quot;key protection&quot; described for some scientists, it is also a common method of cleaning up the ground, picking up rice grains in the cesspool, praising the &quot;emperor&#39;s majestic grace&quot;, and shifting all the blame to &quot;conspirators&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What&#39;s more, in fact, those who developed the two bombs were not spared during the Cultural Revolution. They were also brutally persecuted. Some scientists such as Yao Tongbin were beaten to death, Zhao Jiuzhang was forced to commit suicide, and the &quot;two bombs pioneer&quot; Deng Jiaxian and many other scientific researchers who participated in the work It has also been criticized, and the description in &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is a blatant falsification of history. Similarly, based on relevant historical facts, it is impossible for Mao to give such &quot;enlightened&quot; instructions on the field of two bombs (Zhou Enlai had relevant protection, even if it was not at the beginning but after the scientists were killed and committed suicide), This so-called &quot;instruction&quot; is also a fabrication (Mao did give instructions with a similar tone on other matters, but it cannot cover up his heinous crimes, and it does not mean that he did the same with the two bombs, and historical facts clearly prove it. He didn&#39;t do that). Literary works can of course contain reasonable fictions, but when it comes to specific real historical events, they must be consistent with basic facts, otherwise it is tampering and fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin used these techniques in the book to not only write off Mao&#39;s heinous crimes, but also gave Mao an enlightened, pragmatic, and de-ideological image. In this way, although Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; mentioned the cruelty of the Cultural Revolution, it not only failed to lead to reflection on Mao&#39;s totalitarian tyranny, but instead glorified the devil and gilded the dark era. This is also consistent with the fact that many young people today who do not know the truth worship Mao, so even though &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; mentions the Cultural Revolution, it is still well received by young people with many Mao fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s depiction of the Cultural Revolution in this way is to some extent more detestable and has a worse impact than those authors who avoid talking about the Cultural Revolution in their works. Borrowing Mao&#39;s phrase &quot;flying a red flag to fight against the red flag&quot;, Liu Cixin&#39;s portrayal of that period of history is very similar to &quot;anti-red flag on the surface but actually flying a red flag&quot; or &quot;a small scolding but a big help&quot;. It seems to be talking about the tragedy of the Cultural Revolution, but in fact it is Excusing those responsible, using superb writing methods without avoiding sensitivity but drawing the opposite conclusion, making people feel that Mao and others were really enlightened and innocent even though they knew the cruelty of the Cultural Revolution. Obviously, this is the reason why the book was published in mainland China without a lot of deletions of plots involving the Cultural Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There are also passages in the book where you can see Liu Cixin&#39;s positive attitude towards Mao from between the lines. For example, when the United Nations wanted Luo Ji to move to a residence that was more suitable for an important figure like Wallfacer, Luo Ji said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Do you know Xibaipo? It&#39;s not far from here. It&#39;s a smaller village. More than two centuries ago, the founder of this country once directed the country&#39;s wars there. The scale of those battles is rare in the world.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;From the tone of this paragraph and the context, you can smell the disgusting smell of powdered hair. The thoughts, policies and actions of this &quot;national founder&quot; killed tens of millions of people (including millions of people in Liu Cixin&#39;s hometown of Henan), and most of the victims were Luoshan County, where Liu was born, and Xinyang, where the county belongs. city 鈥嬧€(then called Xinyang District)), destroying tens of thousands or even countless cultural relics and historical sites, and plunged China into a decades-long authoritarian and cruel regime. The common people have lost their rights and the disadvantaged groups are suffering unspeakably. , this legacy still exists today. Created by Mao ZedongstolenThe name of &quot;China&quot; and the people do not understand it eitherA country with power and rights, let alone a &quot;republic&quot;, allows more than one billion or even billions of citizens to live in the world&#39;s largest prison built with tangible borders and invisible walls.But Liu Cixin doesn&#39;t care about this, and neither does today&#39;s vested interest class. They enjoy superior material and non-material supplies, and then put their extravagance and extravagance in the cloak of patriotism and grand historical narrative, and are proud of being a big devil and a national sinner. This is not only a symptom of social Darwinism, but also a typical manifestation of the slave mentality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, some people will excuse this by saying that &quot;China today is a dictatorship, and Liu Cixin has no choice.&quot; But at least he can use neutral terms to describe Mao Zedong and related content, rather than depicting it in a eulogizing way. This was entirely possible, but he didn&#39;t do it. Therefore, Liu Cixin&#39;s praise is very worthy of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(It is worth mentioning that there is also a paragraph in this part. After Mao denied the far-left remarks, he asked someone to write a message to launch to aliens. The content is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Best wishes to the world that receives this message.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Through the following information, you will have a basic understanding of earth civilization. After a long period of labor and creation, mankind has established a splendid civilization, emerged with rich and colorful culture, and initially understood the laws of the operation and development of nature and human society. We cherish all of this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, our world still has great flaws. Hatred, prejudice and war exist. Due to the contradiction between productivity and production relations, the distribution of wealth is seriously uneven, and a considerable number of human beings live in poverty and misery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Human society is working hard to solve various difficulties and problems it faces and to create a better future for earth civilization. The undertaking of the country sending the message is part of this effort. We are committed to building an ideal society in which the labor and value of every human member are fully respected, where the material and spiritual needs of all people are fully met, and where the civilization on earth becomes a more perfect civilization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With good wishes, we look forward to establishing connections with other civilized societies in the universe, and looking forward to working with you to create a better life in the vast universe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Such a passage whitewashes the Cultural Revolution and glorifies Mao. In fact, under the political fervor during the Cultural Revolution, it was more likely that the original far-left fanatics wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To the world that has received the above message, please note that the message you received was sent by a country on earth that represents revolutionary justice! Before this, you may have received information from the same direction, which was sent by an imperialist superpower on the earth. This country competes with another superpower on the earth for world hegemony in an attempt to pull human history backwards. I hope you will not listen to their lies and stand on the side of justice and revolution!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is exactly in line with the political rhetoric and diplomatic rhetoric during the Cultural Revolution. Liu Cixin deliberately wrote these two paragraphs and the comparative display to say that &quot;Mao and his regime were not bad or crazy, it was just some of the people below who were crazy.&quot; This is an old trick used to defend the Cultural Revolution. However, this old trick has been tried many times, and under Liu&#39;s artistic processing, it can be more fake and real. It is especially confusing for people who are not particularly clear about the historical facts of that period and only have a partial understanding)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(3) Ye Wenjie, Shaolin and the female Red Guards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin himself and his work &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; both have strong misogyny. The villains in the article or those who cause bad things are generally women; while those who save the world are all men (of course there are exceptions, but this is generally the case). We will leave the rest for later, but now we will only talk about Ye Wenjie and the characters related to Ye Wenjie, Shaolin, and the female Red Guards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin&#39;s portrayal of the character Ye Wenjie is still very penetrating. The book devotes a lot of space to describing the various persecutions Ye Wenjie suffered, such as losing her parents due to the Cultural Revolution, being abused by political review cadres, and being betrayed by journalist Bai Mulin, etc., creating a woman who is bitter and full of hatred and distrust of human beings. image. Liu Cixin must have understood and come into contact with such victims in reality, or studied relevant historical archives and news materials, in order to portray a character like Ye Wenjie in such a profound way. As with the aforementioned portrayal of Bomb Girl, Liu Cixin clearly has a lot of knowledge about the behavior of victims of society in planning revenge against society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, unlike the disdain and disgust with Bomb Girl, Liu Cixin showed a certain degree of sympathy for the character Ye Wenjie. But fundamentally, Liu Cixin still classifies victims of the era like Ye Wenjie as those who undermine the mainstream social order. Although Liu has written more sympathetic words about the character Ye, he still views Ye from the perspective of mainstream society and counterinsurgents. That is to say, he will never praise the resistance of victims and weak people, but instead reminds the world to beware of such people. In Liu&#39;s writing, Ye Wenjie brutally killed her husband Yang Weining and leader Lei Zhicheng, causing the Three-Body Problem to flood the earth. In the final analysis, she was a sinner and a great sinner. It may not be so obvious when you look at &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; alone, but compared with authors such as Chekhov, Maupassant, and Ba Jin who praise the struggle of the humiliated and damaged weak, Liu Cixin&#39;s meanness to the victims and maintenance of order are incomparable. It&#39;s clearly reflected. In the book, Ye Wenjie was poured cold water all over her body and quilt by a political cadre in winter. Liu Cixin also used her pen to pour cold water into the hearts and minds of the weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In Liu Cixin&#39;s writing, Ye Wenjie achieved redemption by teaching Luo Ji about the sociology of the universe, and was subsequently arrested and tried, and received &quot;deserved&quot; punishment. The trauma Ye Wenjie suffered was attributed to Bai Mulin and other individuals, instead of rising to the system and political power or even culture and social structure. Even though the book vaguely mentions the general background of the times and people&#39;s helplessness in the political storm environment, it also adheres to the red line of not criticizing historical reality. Screaming, reflection, and condemnation will never be touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Moreover, throughout the book, it can be reasonably assumed that Liu Cixin used Ye Wenjie to introduce the power of Trisolaris to &quot;transform&quot; the earth, metaphorically referring to China&#39;s social victims as inviting the power of the United States to invade. Or, at least that&#39;s how others might reasonably understand it. This understanding of the relevant plot was mentioned in an article by a Chinese-American reporter in The New Yorker interviewing Liu Cixin. Based on this metaphorical inference, Liu Cixin’s criticism of ETO for bringing Trisolaran into the earth is to criticize some 「road-leading parties」, or to force Chinese liberals to be 「way-leading parties」. It is also Liu and 「Three-Body」 that have gained China’s vested interest groups. A reason to be sought after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Another negative female character portrayed by Liu Cixin is Ye Wenjie’s mother Shaolin. This female character has a negative image. She not only betrays the relationship between husband and wife and fights against her husband (but also lies with open eyes and denies recognized physical theorems as a physics expert). She also schemingly hooks up with a decentralized cadre and gains prosperity and wealth. Together with her new husband, she alienated and abandoned Ye Wenjie. This kind of plot should not be uncommon during the Cultural Revolution, or even when many disasters occurred. What Liu wrote is a representation of the facts. But the problem is that Liu vilifies women&#39;s forced self-preservation, implying women&#39;s ingratitude. Moreover, this article (including Liu Cixin’s other articles) never appears as an image of a man who is always in love with women. On the contrary, there is an image of a man like Luo Ji who seems cynical but is very loyal and loving to his wife and children. Of course, it is not necessary for a work to deliberately maintain a balance on gender issues, but the text is written from the heart, and combined with Liu Cixin&#39;s entire book and the values 鈥嬧€嬧€嬧€媏 xpressed in his daily life, there is sufficient reason to believe that it is gender biased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The three female Red Guards portrayed in the article better reflect Liu Cixin&#39;s misogyny complex. The article specifically describes five Red Guards, three women and two men. Three female Red Guards are middle school students, and two male Red Guards are college students. The three female middle school Red Guards were very violent, brutal and completely unreasonable. They would only use slogans to deny Ye Zhetai&#39;s fact-based arguments, and then beat Ye Zhetai until his skin and flesh were bruised, and he eventually died. But the male Red Guards &quot;&lt;strong&gt;(Have) a trace of residual sympathy for the teacher&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, and when three female Red Guards were about to beat Ye Zhetai to death, they shouted &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Directive: Fight with words, not with force&lt;/strong&gt;」 (Well, here’s another piece of Mao’s defense) trying to prevent the tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There were indeed many violent female Red Guards and other &quot;revolutionary&quot; women during the Cultural Revolution. It was a group of female students headed by Song Binbin who beat to death Bian Zhongyun, the principal of the Female High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University. In addition, there are many records of female Red Guards and rebels beating and killing people. For example, Ji Xianlin recalled that the female rebel leader Nie Yuanzi directed the rebels to persecute teachers and students at Peking University. The violence of young people and teenage women, as well as the various atrocities committed by some women who became Red Guards and rebel leaders, were specifically mentioned by Yang Jisheng and other official history scholars, who were surprised by the madness of women, especially teenage women. In Beijing, the capital city where the Cultural Revolution was most intense, and on certain occasions, female Red Guards indeed showed unusual destructive power, and their atrocities were witnessed by all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, this does not mean that women in violent movements such as the Cultural Revolution were generally more brutal and anti-intellectual than men. On the contrary, most of the perpetrators of beatings and murder during the Cultural Revolution were still men. This is also proved by a large number of facts, especially those involving various perverted abuses, which were mostly committed by men. For example, most of the violent cases or incidents mentioned in Feng Jicai&#39;s &quot;Ten Years of One Hundred Men&quot; were committed or led by men. The reason why the violence of the female Red Guards is so eye-catching is largely because their violent behavior is in huge contrast with society&#39;s traditional positioning of women and their behavior before the violence. It is even less in line with society&#39;s original expectations than the violent men. Therefore, It becomes more prominent and unique. This exactly reflects the discipline and restraint placed on women by the patriarchal society. Even if women do the same bad behavior as men, they will receive more objections and condemnations. Of course, women’s violence does have its unique characteristics and at certain moments, certain actions are more radical and fanatical than men’s. However, if this creates the impression that 「women are more violent, fanatical, and easily incited」, then it is a sign of patriarchy. The constructed consciousness is nested in the nest. In other words, even if this is a reality that exists sometimes and should not be stripped of its background, it should not be evaluated from a traditional biased perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(4) Three-body game netizens gathering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In this gathering, in addition to Wang Miao and Pan Han, Liu Cixin portrayed six characters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;The old man with gray hair and childlike face is a famous scholar, famous for giving modern scientific connotation to Eastern philosophy. The lady dressed in weird clothes is a famous writer, a rare novelist with avant-garde style but many readers. She wrote You can start reading the book from any page. The other four are two middle-aged people, one is the vice president of the largest software company in the country (dressed simply and casually, you can’t tell at all), and the other is from the National Power Company Senior leaders; two young people, one is a reporter from a major domestic media and the other is a PhD student in science.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin gave these six characters different value choices. To put it simply, the six people were divided into two groups. One group included a reporter, a female writer, an elderly philosopher, and a doctoral student. They were given the image of hating human reality (or even hating the entire human race) and welcoming the invasion of the Three-Body Problem; while the IT deputy The president and Guodian leaders are given an image of being calm, rational, and defending human civilization. Broken down further, journalists and female writers were portrayed as the most radical, an image of being completely disappointed with humanity and eager to embrace the Trisolaran invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This fully reflects Liu Cixin’s views on various groups in society, and is also a view shared by members of the China Socialist Industrial Party. In the eyes of Liu and others, journalists, writers, women, literary and historical philosophers, and young students are all irrational, fond of empty talk, easily emotional, fanatical converts, easily deceived, overly idealistic, and unscrupulous. Reliable, easy to betray... On the contrary, middle-aged men from Kochi Institute of Technology, those working in the science and engineering department, or national civil servants are mature, rational, pragmatic, firm, conservative in ethics and morals, reliable, and committed to career and career. Loyal to the country and mankind...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Through this short chapter, Liu Cixin portrays several groups of people into what he and his peers think they look like. These Socialist Industrialists have always valued theory over literature, despised social justice and humanitarianism, believed in the supremacy of strength, opposed criticism of the system, power, and the strong. They are good at selectively using cold logic, emphasizing spontaneous order and opposing equality and revision. He talks a lot about law and order, but he often takes advantage of legal loopholes and skillfully uses hidden rules to enjoy various privileges and superior conditions as a vested interest. They also like to play with their half-baked knowledge of literature and history, using a mechanical but cunning attitude to understand and explain humanities and social phenomena. What’s even more frightening is that some of these people have also joined key national departments, managing national affairs that should only be handled by people with backgrounds in the humanities and social sciences departments, in a state of 「a layman leading an expert」. Such people are the most powerful force among China&#39;s vested interests and are very powerful in China today. Liu Cixin praises such people and despises their opposite, the humanistic and human rights camp, and of course he gets cheers and applause from his people. (Of course, this does not mean that all people in science and engineering are Socialist Industrialists, only some or even a small part. But this small part is quite harmful)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(5) Evans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The image of Ivens is what Liu Cixin and others recognize as the &quot;white left&quot;. However, Liu Cixin deliberately set up this &quot;white left&quot; to be an extreme environmentalist and animal rights activist, and several &quot;adventists&quot; who joined the Trisolaran organization were also set up to have a similar image, implying that this is common to all &quot;white left&quot; Characteristics and tendencies. By generalizing the extremes, Liu achieved his sinister intention of stigmatizing the &quot;white left&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Liu Cixin first described a Bethune-like figure who was passionate about environmental protection and animal protection, and was unselfish and dedicated to benefiting other animals. But this is just a desire to suppress. As Liu portrays Evans&#39;s despair over mankind&#39;s destruction of the environment and his desire to destroy mankind, the great good man and the great evil man are equated, and &quot;White Zuo&quot; is equated with the devil. In the view of Liu Cixin and social activists, these &quot;white leftists&quot; who live a comfortable life and are enthusiastic about the environment and animal protection have abandoned the principle of putting human beings first and &quot;human&quot; rights first, and will eventually destroy mankind. Liu Cixin also hinted that people should be wary of such &quot;white leftists&quot; in power to prevent them from bringing devastating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; .&lt;/p&gt;

100% 吻合劉慈欣的本意，也沒有人有這樣的本事，除非有人可以探測出劉慈欣的大腦在想什麼。還有很多評斷是基於劉慈欣和他的《三體》的客觀影響、讀者反響。一個作品表達的是什麼意義，很大程度在於有自由表達權的讀者中的主流所認為的意義（尤其在作者有能力否認卻沒有否認、否認但是不符合邏輯的情況下）。作者和讀者、作品和反響是互動的關係，而非單向的灌輸意義。作者在寫作時也應該考慮到它究竟會有什麼影響，包括自認為的被「誤讀」。所以，我會通過它在讀者中的認知和影響，反推劉慈欣在《三體》中內容情感為何，這並不是故意冤枉他。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;還有，本文作為評論性的文章，當然以批判為主，即便我對劉慈欣的一部分觀點贊同，也不會大篇幅的提及。對於劉慈欣塑造的一些爭議不大的人物形象（或者説至少我覺得沒什麼特別需要批判的），如章北海、羅輯等人，以及一些沒有特別喻示意義的事件、情節，也就不會費多少筆墨。我寫的內容絕大多數都是有異議的那部分。而從整體上，如前所述我讚揚其「能」批判其「德」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（一）史強&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;《三體》中第一個出場的人物是科學家汪淼，但第一個細緻刻畫的人物則是前來約談汪淼的警察史強。寥寥幾頁，就刻畫了一個粗魯野蠻、具入侵性的人物形象。熟讀《三體》的鐵粉當然知道，開篇對史強的描寫，以及後面類似的描寫，都是在反襯史強精明強幹、充滿勇氣與責任心做鋪墊。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;或者更準確的説，劉慈欣故意將奸狡頑劣與能幹及有責任心聯繫起來，暗示有流氓習氣的人物往往是「外冷內熱」，本質是好人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我們截取對小説中史強的描述，可以看看劉慈欣想表達、試圖灌輸一種怎樣的價值觀。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在《三體》開篇，史強與汪淼見面時：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（汪淼説）「‘科學邊界’是一個在國際學術界很有影響的學術組織，成員都是著名學者。這樣一個合法的學術組織，我怎麼就不能接觸了呢？」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「你看看你這個人！」史強大聲説，「我們説它不合法了嗎？我們説不讓你接觸了嗎？」他 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;説着，剛才吸進肚子裏的煙都噴到汪淼臉上。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「我有權不回答，你們請便吧。」汪淼説着要轉身回屋。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「等等！」史強厲聲説，同時朝旁邊的年輕警官揮了一下手，「給他地址和電話，下午去走一趟。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而正是這樣一個人，在稍後汪淼被三體人制造的幻象打擊的幾乎要自殺時，用巧妙的方式讓汪淼鼓起了生的勇氣，並振作起來參與破獲了地球三體組織（ETO）的陰謀。再往後，史強還出奇策（即「古箏行動」）伏殺了伊文思和「審判日」號，以及多次搭救、保護了另一個科學家羅輯，可謂居功甚偉。此外，劉慈欣還描寫了史強與汪淼、羅輯的深厚友情。正是在史強的鼓勵下，汪淼才重新鼓起生的勇氣，並且幫助政府和軍警破獲了「地球三體組織」的一系列罪案；對羅輯而言，史強更是摯友，一直保護羅輯，並且促使他由放蕩不羈到負起保衞人類的責任。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我們一開始看到史強的形象，很像現實中濫用警權、欺壓百姓的惡警。書中也的確列舉了他的劣跡：處理劫持人質事件時不顧人質安危、鼓動黑幫黑吃黑、刑訊逼供……這樣的「惡警」卻挽救了一個重要的科學家，進而挽救了人類的命運。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣在這裏的暗示就是，德行不是重要的，才能才是第一的；濫用職權、違法亂紀沒關係，最重要是「有用」。而且，這樣的人雖然對陌生人、敵人殘酷，但對待朋友還是可以肝膽相照的。更進一步，劉的春秋筆法在暗示，恰恰是史強這種惡人，才有常人所沒有的狡黠、膽識、才華，彬彬有禮、遵紀守法的人反而做不到。這就很容易得出一個推論：人們要容忍惡人、惡警，容忍他們的不法行徑，因為只有這樣歷經醜惡、一身匪氣的人，才有保護我們的能力。或許，這正是劉慈欣想傳達給我們的。這在《三體》中並非孤例，後面還有一些人物如託馬斯維德，可以證明劉這種隱隱的暗示。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在全書中，還有許多對史強的正面描寫，如前面提到的講他和汪淼、羅輯的友情，可謂很感人。劉慈欣試圖將史強的流氓色彩與俠義之心都強化起來，讓人們形成一種印象，即這種看起來很壞（實際也有明顯壞的一面）的人本質上是好的，人們應該理解、容忍、欣賞、讚譽他們。這有點像《水滸傳》對那些既行俠仗義又殺人越貨的好漢們的描寫。不過水滸裏那些「好漢」是反體制、反強權的人，劉慈欣筆下的史強和託馬斯維德則都是穿着官衣、維護秩序的統治階層，還都是暴力機器的組成部分。《水滸傳》歌頌的是反抗精神，《三體》則是讚揚「壓迫精神」。且無論劉慈欣主觀意圖如何，客觀上為國家強力部門人員洗了地是事實。大多數文學作家都會在字裏行間譴責暴力機器的野蠻、統治階層的骯髒（包括格調並不高的黑幫小説《東北往事》，也是先談了幹部階層的貪腐乃至政權對民主抗議的鎮壓，再講民間社會的黑幫暴力），只有劉慈欣這樣的會變着法的為體制及體制的附着物唱讚歌。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;另一段對史強的描寫，不僅再次充實了史強這個「流氓警察英雄」的形象，還透露了劉慈欣對社會中相對邊緣的、不幸的家庭受害者的污名、怨毒心態。書中有一段史強與軍警突襲 ETO 會議，遭遇一個年輕女孩持炸彈威脅時的情景：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「站住。」核彈女孩向大史拋了個媚眼警告道，右手拇指緊按在起爆開關上，指甲油在電筒光中閃亮着。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「悠着點兒丫頭，有件事兒你肯定想知道。」大史站在距女孩七八米遠處，從衣袋中掏出一個信封，「你母親找到了。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;女孩兒神采飛揚的眼睛立刻黯淡了下來，但這時，這雙眼睛真的通向她的心靈。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;大史趁機又向前跨了兩步，將自己與女孩的間距縮短至五米左右，女孩警惕地一舉核彈，用目光制止了他，但她的注意力已經被大大分散了。剛才扔掉假核彈的兩人中的一個向大史走來，伸手來拿他舉着的信封，大史閃電般抽出手槍，他抽槍的動作正好被取信的人擋住， &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;女孩沒有看到，她只看到取信人的耳邊亮光一閃，懷中的核彈就被擊中爆炸了。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「那個女孩子是誰？」汪淼問。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;大史咧嘴一笑，「我他媽的怎麼知道，瞎猜的，這樣的女孩子，多半沒見過媽。我幹這行二十多年，就學會了看人。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在劉慈欣筆下，妄圖破壞現行秩序、採用極端手段對抗主流社會的人，往往都是社會的受害者、邊緣人羣（當然客觀上也的確是這樣）。而且，從上面借史強之口説出的對女孩的評價及語氣，可看出劉慈欣對其並非抱以同情而是鄙夷、厭棄。這種語調就像保守社會裏對被性侵的女性那樣，不是深表同情，而是覺得受害者「髒」。在劉慈欣們眼裏，這些走極端的、鬧事的、反抗秩序的，就是被家庭拋棄的、「沒媽」的可憐又可恨的蟲子。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而這是很符合如今中國社會達爾文主義浪潮下的價值觀的。每當社會上發生極端事件，互聯網上都是一片「我不想知道他經歷了什麼，我只想要他死刑」的聲音，彷彿有罪的不是蔡京高俅，而是楊志林沖（當然嚴格來説楊志林沖的確有罪）。而對於那些採取和平抗議、正規渠道上訪的可憐人，人們也個個冷眼旁觀甚至幸災樂禍。他們不是不知道這些受害者遭受苦難，而是高高在上的鄙視、排斥之，不僅不覺得自己要負上某種責任、參與社會某種必要的改變，還覺得這些弱勢者礙了自己眼、影響了自己心情。劉慈欣的《三體》大火，正在於字裏行間和中上階層社達化利己主義化的心態形成互鳴。（當然我並不贊同傷及無辜，而且認為一旦做了這種事，無論原因如何都需要承擔責任而不能脫罪，但是討論原因和解決問題哪怕緩和矛盾，都是必要的，而不是隻憑藉暴力威壓、滅殺反彈）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;《三體》中史強這樣的人物，歐美日韓文學和影視作品中也有許多形似神也似乎似的形象，即一個看似不正派（或者也的確不正派）的人卻在重要事情和生死關頭表現出超凡的勇氣與責任心，以反映人性的複雜、人性的光輝。但是仔細分析和感受，就會發現其實《三體》中史強、託馬斯維德、羅輯等這樣的形象及塑造目的，與大多數歐美日韓作品並不相同。後者（例如契訶夫、莫泊桑、雨果、巴爾扎克的小説中刻畫的似乎相似的人物）是為了反映人性的複雜、正義的光輝，前者則更像在為強權與惡人洗白，在為壓迫者與既得利益階層貼金。這可以通過字裏行間的感情傾向、細節描寫、整體環境乃至作者的創作背景及可能的目的等，進行合理的分析和推測，當然讀者自身的價值觀和經歷也會引起不同感受。飽讀中外文學與影視作品的，至少有一部分人應該會產生這種共鳴。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;例如雨果最知名的著作《悲慘世界》，刻畫了冉阿讓這一「罪犯」身份的角色。但雨果並未將冉阿讓描寫的像「炸彈女孩」這樣讓人厭棄，相反刻畫的頗為令人同情。而執行法律、抓捕冉阿讓的沙威警長，並不像史強那樣因壞而「酷」、壞的令人佩服，反而被雨果刻畫的讓讀者感到痛恨。最後，沙威警長也良知甦醒，與冉阿讓共同完成了救贖。在《悲慘世界》中，每個人都良心未泯，且正是由於都保有底線，乃至在可以達成目的時故意「放水（如沙威放走冉阿讓）」，才讓「悲慘世界」以走向光明而落幕（而非讓法國乃至世界變成「黑暗森林）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而莫泊桑的《羊脂球》、契訶夫的《萬卡》、魯迅的《祝福》，都以刻畫一個弱勢受害者為小説主題，字裏行間都表達了對當事人深深的同情，並將她/他們的遭遇歸於環境的惡劣尤其他人的無情，鞭撻了社會的醜惡、綱常的虛偽。這三位作家的更多作品，也都是如此的感情傾向和道德立場。這與劉慈欣鄙夷乃至譏嘲弱者、稱頌惡人、讚頌秩序的態度截然相反。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;不僅這些名家名作如此，即便是一些並不那麼偉大的文藝作品，也會保留許多基本的「人味」。例如曾經風靡中國的刑偵劇《重案六組》，裏邊的警察也是個性各異，但也都保留起碼的人性良知。或許三體中史強的形象更符合部分警察的真實面目，但顯然不應以稱頌和鼓勵的態度刻畫之。《重案六組》中的警察或許理想化了，但這樣的文宣也可以對警察隊伍形成一種有益的引導，而非邪惡的暗示。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（二）文革&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;《三體》中提及文革，被一些書評人當成當代文學作品一大突破，也成為《三體》一大賣點。一些不怎麼瞭解詳情的人，還因此以為劉慈欣是敢於觸及敏感問題、反思歷史的偉大作家。據人推測，當年《三體》第一部獲雨果獎，可能就與書中敢於提及這一中國的政治禁忌有關。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;的確，文中提到的瘋狂歲月、武鬥場面，尺度之大令人震驚。在中國公開發行的暢銷文學作品中，鮮有如《三體》這樣直接的呈現慘烈的文革情景。書中也描繪了對知識的摧殘、對學者的迫害，以及政治鬥爭下家庭離散、朋友背叛的人倫慘劇。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;可是，這一切都只是現象、現象。本質呢？原因呢？是誰造成了這樣的悲劇？劉慈欣在書中和現實裏都不曾對釀成文革的這個政權、這個統治集團做任何的不利評判。在描繪文革中種種現象的同時，完全迴避了對相關的制度、人物、文化的反思與批判。只有陳述現象，這種陳述方式和語氣似乎在告訴人們，這是一場歷史中註定發生的悲劇，沒有責任人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;如果劉慈欣對文革的冷靜敍述還不能完全説明其政治態度，那麼他對文革「始作俑者」的態度，足以反映問題了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在關於「紅岸基地」的一些文件中，我們可以找到一段顯然暗示是毛所寫的批語，摘錄如下：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「【批示】已閲，狗屁不通！大字報在地上貼就行了，不要發到天上去，文革領導組今後不要介入紅岸。這樣重要的信件應慎重起草，最好成立一個專門小組，並在政治局會議上討論通過。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;還有這一段：「&lt;strong&gt;這個年代，要搞倒一個位置很高的人，就要在其分管的各個領域得到他的黑材料，但兩彈工程對陰謀家們來説是個棘手的領域，這個工程處於中央的重點保護之下，得以避開「文革」的風雨，他們很難插手進去。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;又是那套「都是底下人辦壞事，皇上是開明的」的可恥洗地邏輯。改革開放後，「前三十年」將毛澤東塑造為「偉光正」聖人的崇拜模式結束了（雖然近些年又在冒起），取而代之的是將毛一些逸聞、個性化的言論加以編排，塑造一種平易近人、高瞻遠矚、稜角分明的形象，並巧妙迴避他的巨大罪惡，以吸引不明全貌者對其的喜愛甚至崇拜。不得不説，這種描寫方式很有迷惑性，遠比「偉光正」、「高大全」的形象能俘獲當代青年的人心。至於描述的對部分科學家「重點保護」，同樣是洗地的慣常手段，在屎坑裏撿米粒，歌頌「皇恩浩蕩」，把責任都推給「陰謀家」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;何況，實際上研發兩彈人員在文革中也並未倖免，同樣受到了殘酷迫害，一些科學家如姚桐斌被打死、趙九章被迫自殺身亡，「兩彈元勳」鄧稼先及其他許多參與工作的科研人員也遭批鬥，《三體》中的描述是公然的篡改歷史。同樣，根據相關史實，毛也不可能對兩彈領域做出那樣「開明」的批示（周恩來有過相關保護，哪怕也不是一開始就保護而是發生了科學家被打死、自殺事件後），這段所謂「批示」也形同捏造（毛確實在其他事情上做過類似語氣的批示，但一不能掩蓋其滔天罪惡，二不能説明他在兩彈事情上也這麼做了，而且史實明確證明他沒這麼做）。文學作品當然可以有合理虛構，但是在涉及到具體的真實歷史事件時，必須與基本事實相符合，否則就是在篡改和捏造。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣在書中正是使用了這些手法，不僅將毛的滔天罪惡勾銷，還賦予毛一種開明、務實、去意識形態化的形象。這樣，劉慈欣的《三體》雖提到了文革的殘酷，卻不僅沒引導反思毛的極權暴政，反為魔頭增色、為黑暗年代貼金。這同樣與當今許多不明真相的青年崇毛合拍，使得《三體》即便提及文革，仍然獲毛粉眾多的青年人好評。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣這樣描繪文革，某種程度比那些在作品中迴避不談文革的作者更可惡、影響更壞。借用毛一句話「打着紅旗反紅旗」，劉慈欣對那段歷史的刻畫很像「表面反紅旗實際反而在打紅旗」或者説「小罵大幫忙」，看似講文革慘劇，實際上卻在為相關責任人開脫，用高超的寫作方式不迴避敏感卻得出相反結論，讓人在知曉文革殘酷的情況下，還覺得毛等人真是開明和無辜的。顯然，這也正是該書對涉及文革的情節沒有大量刪改就得以在中國大陸出版發行的原因。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;書中還有段落可以從字裏行間看到劉慈欣對毛的肯定態度，如聯合國希望羅輯搬到一個更符合面壁者這樣重要人物身份的居所時，羅輯説的話：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「知道西柏坡嗎？離這兒不遠，那是一個更小的村莊，兩個多世紀前，這個國家的創始人曾在那裏指揮過全國的戰爭，那些戰役的規模世界罕見。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;從本段語氣及結合上下文，又可以嗅出那股令人作嘔的毛粉味。這個「國家創始人」的思想、政策和行為殺害和致死了數千萬人（包括劉慈欣老家河南幾百萬人，且大多數死難者正是劉的籍貫地羅山縣及該縣所屬的信陽市（當時叫信陽專區）的居民），破壞了成千上萬乃至難以計數的文物和歷史遺蹟，也讓中國陷入長達數十年的專制酷政，平民百姓權利喪失，弱勢羣體苦不堪言，這遺毒迄今猶存。毛澤東創建的這個竊取了「中華」之名、人民也不掌握權力和擁有權利、更無「共和」之實的國家，讓十多億乃至累計數十億國民生活在有形邊界和無形高牆構築的世界最大監牢中。但劉慈欣不在乎這些，當今的既得利益階層也不在乎這些，他們享受着優越的物質和非物質供給，再為驕奢淫逸披上愛國主義、宏大歷史敍事的外衣，為大魔頭兼民族罪人而自豪。這不僅是社會達爾文主義的一種症狀，更是奴才心理的典型表現。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;當然，有人會以「當今中國是專制政治，劉慈欣是不得已」為之開脫。但是起碼他可以使用中性詞彙描述毛澤東及相關內容，而不是以讚頌方式描繪。這完全是可以做得到的，可以他沒有這樣做。所以，劉慈欣的這種讚頌是非常值得被批判的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（值得提及的是，這部分還有一段內容，是在講毛否定那段極左言論後，又讓人撰寫了一段向外星發射的信息，內容如下：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;向收到該信息的世界致以美好的祝願。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;通過以下信息，你們將對地球文明有一個基本的瞭解。人類經過漫長的勞動和創造，建立了燦爛的文明，湧現出豐富多彩的文化，並初步瞭解了自然界和人類社會運行發展的規律，我們珍視這一切。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但我們的世界仍有很大缺陷，存在着仇恨、偏見和戰爭，由於生產力和生產關係的矛盾，財富的分佈嚴重不均，相當部分的人類成員生活在貧困和苦難之中。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;人類社會正在努力解決自己面臨的各種困難和問題，努力為地球文明創造一個美好的未來。發送該信息的國家所從事的事業就是這種努力的一部分。我們致力於建立一個理想的社會，使每個人類成員的勞動和價值都得到充分的尊重，使所有人的物質和精神需要都得到充分的滿足，使地球文明成為一個更加完美的文明。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我們懷着美好的願望，期待着與宇宙中其他文明社會建立聯繫，期待着與你們一起，在廣闊的宇宙中創造更加美好的生活。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;這樣一段話又是粉飾文革、為毛貼金的。事實上，文革中那種政治狂熱下，更可能的是原來的極左狂熱分子編寫的那樣：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;收到以上信息的世界請注意，你們收到的信息，是地球上代表革命正義的國家發出的！這之前，你們可能已經收到了來自同樣方向的信息，那是地球上的一個帝國主義超級大國發出的，這個國家與地球上的另一個超級大國爭奪世界霸權，企圖把人類歷史拉向倒退。希望你們不要聽信他們的謊言，站在正義的一方，站在革命的一方！&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;這恰恰最符合文革時期的政治辭令、外交辭令。劉慈欣故意編寫這兩段內容及對比展示，意在講「毛和政權並不壞不瘋狂，瘋狂的只是下面一些人」這套為文革辯護的舊伎倆。但是這種舊伎倆的確屢試不爽，且在劉的藝術加工下更能以假亂真，對於對那段歷史史實並不特別清楚、只是一知半解的人，特別有迷惑性）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（三）葉文潔、紹琳和女紅衞兵&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣本人及其作品《三體》都有很強的厭女情結。文中的反派人物或搞壞事情的，普遍都是女性；而拯救世界的，則都是男性（當然也有例外，但是大體如此）。其他人放在以後再説，現在只談葉文潔及與葉文潔有關的人物紹琳、女紅衞兵。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣對葉文潔這個人物，刻畫的還是很入骨的。書中用了很大篇幅講述葉文潔遭遇的種種迫害，如因文革喪父失母、被政審幹部虐待、被記者白沐霖背叛等，塑造了一個苦大仇深、對人類充滿怨恨與不信任的女性形象。劉慈欣一定是在現實中瞭解、接觸過這種受害者，或者研究過相關歷史檔案、新聞資料，才能將葉文潔這樣的人物形象刻畫的入木三分。如前面提到的對炸彈女孩的刻畫那樣，劉慈欣顯然對社會的受害者籌劃報復社會的行為頗有研究。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;不過，不像對炸彈女孩那樣的鄙夷與厭棄，劉慈欣對葉文潔這個人物施以了一定的同情。但根本上，劉慈欣還是將葉文潔這樣的時代受害者歸為毀損主流社會秩序的人。劉雖然對葉這個人物多了同情的筆墨，但仍是站在主流社會、平叛者的角度來看待葉的，也就是他絕不會稱頌受害者、弱者的反抗，反而在提醒世人提防這樣的人。在劉的筆下，葉文潔殘忍害死丈夫楊衞寧和領導雷志成，引三體禍水湧向地球，歸根結底是個罪人、大罪人。單獨看《三體》或許還不是那麼明顯，但是和契訶夫、莫泊桑、巴金這樣作者對被侮辱與被損害的弱者抗爭的謳歌比起來，劉慈欣對受害者的刻薄、對秩序的維護就無比明顯的體現出來了。書中葉文潔被一個政工幹部在冬天潑了一身和一被子冷水，劉慈欣同樣在用筆往弱者心肝裏注入冷水。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在劉慈欣筆下，葉文潔以給羅輯講宇宙社會學的方式做了救贖，隨後就被拘捕和審判，受到了「應有的」懲罰。對於葉文潔所受的創傷，都歸咎給了白沐霖等個體，而不會上升到制度與政權乃至文化與社會結構。即便書中恍恍惚惚提及了時代的大背景、人們在政治風暴大環境下的無奈，也謹守不涉及批判歷史現實的紅線。吶喊、反思、聲討，是萬萬不會碰的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而且，縱觀全書，可以合理假設，劉慈欣是將葉文潔引三體力量「改造」地球，暗喻為中國的社會受害者引美國的力量入侵。或者，至少其他人對此可以合理的這樣理解。在《紐約客》一位華裔美國記者採訪劉慈欣的文章中，就提及了對相關情節的這種理解。根據這樣的暗喻推論，劉慈欣撻伐 ETO 引三體入地球，也就是在抨擊一些「帶路黨」，或者説把中國自由派強行當成「帶路黨」，也是劉及《三體》得到中國既得利益羣體追捧的一個原因。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣刻畫的另一個反面女性人物，是葉文潔的母親紹琳。這個女性人物的形象負面，不僅背棄夫妻情分批鬥自己丈夫（而且還睜眼説瞎話，作為物理學專家否定被公認的物理定理），還很有心機的勾上一個下放幹部，得到榮華富貴後又和新丈夫一起疏遠離棄葉文潔。這種情節在文革中應該並不鮮見，甚至説在許多災禍發生時都不鮮見，劉所寫的是一種事實的再現。但是問題是劉將女性這種迫不得已的自保醜化，暗示女性的忘恩負義。而且，這文章（也包括劉慈欣任何其他文章）中從沒有出現男性對女性始亂終棄的人物形象，相反有羅輯那樣看似玩世不恭卻對妻兒非常忠貞和愛護的男人形象。當然，一部著作是沒必要必須在性別議題上刻意保持平衡，但是文由心生，結合劉慈欣全書及其日常表現的價值觀，有充足理由相信其是帶有性別偏見的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;文中刻畫的那三個女紅衞兵，更能體現劉慈欣的厭女情結。文中特意寫了三女兩男五個紅衞兵，三個女紅衞兵是中學生，兩個男紅衞兵是大學生。三個女中學生紅衞兵非常狂暴野蠻，完全不講理，只會用口號否定葉哲泰基於事實的辯駁，然後將葉哲泰打的皮開肉綻，最終死去。而男紅衞兵反而「&lt;strong&gt;對老師（有）一絲殘存的同情&lt;/strong&gt;」，並且在三個女紅衞兵將要打死葉哲泰時喊出「&lt;strong&gt;最高指示：要文鬥不要武鬥&lt;/strong&gt;」（呃，這裏又一處為毛辯解的）試圖阻止悲劇。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;文革中的確有不少狂暴的女紅衞兵和其他「革命」女性，打死北師大女附中校長卞仲耘的就是以宋彬彬為首的一羣女學生。除此之外，也有許多女紅衞兵、造反派打人虐人殺人的記錄，如季羨林就憶述女性造反派頭目聶元梓指揮造反派迫害北大師生。青年和少年女性的狂暴，以及一些躋身紅衞兵、造反派領袖的女性各種暴行，為楊繼繩等正史學者特地提及，並詫異於女性尤其青少年女性的這種瘋狂。在文革最激烈的首都北京及某些場合，女紅衞兵的確表現出異乎尋常的破壞力，其暴行也是有目共睹。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，這並不意味着文革等暴力運動中女性比男性普遍更加殘暴、反智。相反，文革中大多數打人殺人者仍然是男性，這同樣有大量事實證明，尤其涉及各種變態凌虐的，大都是男性做出的。如馮驥才的《一百個人的十年》中提到的大多數暴力案例或事件，都是男性做下或者主導的。而女紅衞兵的暴力之所以非常引人注目，很大程度在於其暴虐舉動與社會對女性的傳統定位及暴虐前的表現形成巨大反差，比施暴的男性更不符合社會原有的期待，所以就顯得更為突出和特異。這恰恰反映了男權社會對女性的規訓和約束，讓女性哪怕做一些和男性一樣的糟糕行為，都會得到更多異議和譴責。當然女性的暴力也確有獨特之處及某些時刻某些舉動比男性更加激進狂熱的情況，但是如果以此形成「女性更暴力更狂熱更易被煽動」的印象，那就是進了男權主義建構的意識巢窠中了。或者説，即便這是部分時候存在的某種不應該剝離背景的現實，但也不應該以傳統的偏見視角去評價。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（四）三體遊戲網友聚會&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在這場聚會中，除汪淼和潘寒外，劉慈欣刻畫了六個人物形象：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「那位鶴髮童顏的老者，是一位著名學者，以給東方哲學賦予現代科學內涵而聞名。那位穿着怪異的女士，是著名作家，是少見的風格前衞卻擁有眾多讀者的小説家，她寫的書，從哪一頁開始看都行。其他四位，兩名中年人，一位是國內最大軟件公司的副總裁（穿着樸素隨意，絲毫看不出來），另一位是國家電力公司的高層領導；兩名年輕人，一位是國內大媒體的記者，另一位是在讀的理科博士生。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣賦予了這六個角色不同的價值選擇。簡單來説，將六人分成了兩組，一組包括記者、女作家、老年哲學家、博士生，被賦予了厭惡人類現實（甚至厭惡整個人類）、歡迎三體入侵的形象；而 IT 副總裁和國電領導則被賦予了冷靜、理性、捍衞人類文明的形象。再細分，記者和女作家被描繪的最為激進，一幅對人類徹底失望、急切擁抱三體入侵者的形象。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;這充分反映了劉慈欣對社會各羣體的看法，也是中國社達工業黨人士共同的看法。在劉及這些人眼中，記者、作家、女性、文史哲學者、青年學生，都是不理性的、喜好空談的、容易感情用事的、皈依者狂熱的、易受蠱惑的、過於理想主義的、不可靠的、易背叛的……相反，高知理工中年男性、從事理工部門工作的或國家公務員，則是成熟的、理性的、務實的、堅定的、保守倫常道德的、可靠的、對事業、國家和人類忠誠的……&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣通過這短短的一章，就將幾類人羣刻畫成他及同類們認為的模樣。這些社達工業黨們向來重理輕文，蔑視社會公正及人道主義，信奉實力至上，反對對制度、強權、強者的批判，擅於選擇性利用冷冰冰的邏輯，強調自發秩序反對平權和修正，滿嘴

卻自己經常鑽法律的空子及純熟利用潛規則，享受着作為既得利益者擁有的各種特權和優越條件。他們還很喜歡耍弄其民科型半吊子文史知識，用機械卻又狡猾的態度去理解和解釋人文社會現象。更可怕的是，這些人中的一部分還躋身國家要害部門，以「外行領導內行」的狀態，管理着本應是人文社科院系出身者才能負責的國家事務。這樣的人是中國既得利益者中最龐大的勢力，在當今中國非常得勢。劉慈欣吹捧這樣的同類，鄙夷他們對立面的人文人道人權派，當然得到同類們的歡呼喝彩。（當然並不是説所有理工科人士都是社達工業黨，只是一部分乃至一小部分。但這一小部分就頗具危害）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（五）伊文思&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;伊文思這個形象，就是劉慈欣們所認知的「白左」。只是，劉慈欣有意的將這個「白左」設置成極端環保和動保人士，還有幾個加入三體組織的「降臨派」也被設置成類似形象，暗示這是所有「白左」共同的特徵和傾向。通過將極端者一般化，劉就達到了其污名化「白左」的險惡用心。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣首先描述了一個熱衷於環保和動物保護、毫不利己專門利它的白求恩式人物。但這只是欲抑先揚。隨着劉刻畫出伊文思對人類破壞環境的絕望、生出的毀滅人類之心，大善人和大惡人畫上了等號，「白左」和惡魔畫上了等號。在劉慈欣和社達分子們看來，這些生活優渥、熱心環境和動物保護的「白左」們，背棄了人類第一、「人」權至上的原則，最終一定會毀滅人類。劉慈欣也在暗示人們要警惕這樣的「白左」當道，防止他們帶來毀滅性的後果。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;這又是能引起劉慈欣的粉絲們瘋狂共鳴的。在中國互聯網平台，被辱罵最多的就是「白左」。不僅環保和動保分子會被視為「白左」，諸如主張提高社會福利、給富人徵稅、種族平權、女權和 LGBT 權利、接納移民、廢除死刑……都會被冠以「白左」之名。社達分子視社會平等和博愛主義為寇仇，他們認為這些以「愛」、「平等」為名的政策抹殺了物競天擇適者生存的價值，導致了人和社會的墮落。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣塑造出伊文思這樣一個極端環保動保分子形象，就是傳達「白左」禍亂人類世界這一思想。當然，他還塑造了程心這一很有愛心但敗事有餘的更加典型的「白左」，這留在後面來説。誠然，我個人也反對極端的環保和動保分子，對所謂「白左」的部分價值觀和行為不能同意，但劉慈欣這樣以偏概全、用極端例子暗示普遍性的故意渲染更為噁心。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;書中有一段一位 ETO 成員的話，很值得玩味：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「這不是謠傳！」一個歐洲人大聲説，同時擠到前面來，「我叫拉菲爾，以色列人。三年前，我十四歲的兒子遇到了車禍，我把孩子的腎捐給了一個患尿毒症的巴勒斯坦女孩，以此表達我對兩個民族和平相處的願望，為了這個願望，我甚至可以獻出自己的生命，而許許多多的以色列人和巴勒斯坦人也在做着和我一樣的真誠努力。但這一切都沒有用，我們的家園仍在冤冤相報的泥潭中越陷越深。這使我對人類失去了信心，加入了三體組織。絕望使我由一個和平主義者變為極端分子，同時，可能也是由於我對組織鉅額的捐助，讓我得以進入降臨派的核心。現在我告訴你們，降臨派有自己的祕密綱領，它就是：人類是一個邪惡的物種，人類文明已經對地球犯下了滔天罪行，必須為此受到懲罰。降臨派的最終目標就是請主來執行這個神聖的懲罰：毀滅全人類！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在劉慈欣看來（或者説他想讓讀者認為的是），那些強烈追求世界和平、美好的人如果達不成這樣的目的，就會因絕望悲憤轉向厭棄人類、試圖毀滅一切，因此這些主張愛與和平的「白左」實質都是潛在的恐怖分子，危害比一般的、謀求私利、道德低下的壞人大多了。而一些「白左」執着、堅定的信念，充滿熱情的情緒、為改變現實不惜代價的行為，都會被劉慈欣們視為瘋狂或走向瘋狂的前兆，視為秩序的破壞者或就是徹頭徹尾的神經病，應該予以警惕、撲滅、摧毀。而像伊文思、拉菲爾這樣有錢有能力更積極將理想付諸實踐的「白左」，劉慈欣們認為更應該被警惕和撲滅，因為這些人有更大的現實危險性。書中伊文思和「降臨派」在「古箏行動」中集體慘死，就是劉對「白左」怨毒的顯露。即便劉慈欣並不認為白左會去毀滅世界，也是認為白左的種種行為和傾向，最終會在客觀上導致世界毀滅。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;真實世界的「白左」當然不是這樣，或者起碼大多數不是這樣。雖然左翼分子不乏走到極端的，但是就像為極端理想而訴諸暴力的日本赤軍、紅色旅、埃塔，以及一些特別極端（尤其使用暴力）的環保動保人士那樣，是非常邊緣化的，完全不能代表主張變革主義、愛與和平至上的主流左派。至於馬列毛那種「左派」或者説理想主義激進主義者，無論價值觀還是行為，顯然已和劉慈欣所描述的那種「白左」大相徑庭，沒有比擬的意義。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;當然，主流左派確實會在不斷努力後卻無法解決人類的醜惡而失望乃至絕望，也會滋生一種「乾脆世界毀滅算了」的情緒，但是這種情緒不代表其現實中真的會這麼選擇。就像人和他人發生矛盾、遇到委屈，某個時間段（或者就是幾秒鐘一個念頭）想弄死對方或者破罐破摔的情緒很正常，但是大多數都會平復下來，而不可能真的去實踐。就像魯迅就經常發表對人性醜惡絕望的言論，也説過「不在沉默中爆發，就在沉默中滅亡」這樣的話，但是他真的是要人們毀滅世界嗎？並不是，相反他在呼籲人們堅定的追求真善美、公平正義。「白左」普遍非常關注氣候變暖問題並阻止惡化，如果因絕望、認為世間骯髒而真想毀滅人類，或者覺得人類毀滅也不足惜，那應該是鼓吹放棄拯救氣候變暖，以期待若干年後陸地被淹沒、高溫把人類都熱死才對。而且，隨着時代發展社會進步，左翼或者説「白左」是越來越溫和的，且經過 20 世紀一些極端的嘗試失敗後，現在都選擇更加折中理性的方式解決問題，不求絕對完美。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（六）黑暗森林&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「黑暗森林法則」是劉慈欣《三體》第二部的主題，也直接表達了他的社達主義理念。所謂「黑暗森林」，就是人（或整個人類文明），處於有限而黑暗的空間之中，人與人（或星球與星球）之間存在着你死我活的競爭關係。為爭奪生存空間、消除潛在威脅，這些人（星球）之間都想方設法要除掉或征服對方。他還通過描述星際艦隊自相殘殺以爭奪資源，來將「黑暗森林法則」更加凸出的展示出來。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣的黑暗森林理論，主要顯然並不是為瞭解釋星球之間的關係，而是喻指人與人、族羣與族羣、國家與國家之間的關係。雖然劉慈欣曾在對他的採訪中否認了這一點，但其言不由衷。劉慈欣在《三體》中描述的內容和宣揚的價值觀，都是在喻指現實世界、人類社會，而不是為科幻而科幻。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣這樣的價值觀，將不同的人或羣體對立起來，將競爭視為零和博弈，認為只有消滅或征服對方自身才能安全，與兩三個世紀前至上世紀中期盛行於全球（也曾一度在中國學界被熱捧）的社會達爾文主義思想有非常多共同之處。而今日的世界，這一理論雖已不在廟堂之高公開被認可，卻在江湖之遠四處流行。從俄羅斯到印度，從尼日利亞到印尼，社達思潮都以民族主義、民粹主義等形式存在着。而在中國，則普遍以尊崇強權和體制、歧視和欺凌同胞中的弱者等形式存在着，且更加貼近社會達爾文主義的本來面目：恃強凌弱、適者生存。例如中國精英羣體聚集的論壇知乎，就是社達主義大本營，也同樣是《三體》及劉慈欣本人的粉絲集中地。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「黑暗森林法則」的根本缺陷是，無視人或人羣之間存在的互助合作、傳播文明的善意，無視道德、是非與人道主義的因素存在，無視未來有更好的價值觀和方式來改善現狀的可能性（劉在書中甚至對這種改善持強烈反對的態度，原因下一節就會提到），無視追求人道、平等、互信的必要性，將人際、族際、國際關係完全當成沒有人性的冷冰冰赤裸裸的利益關係，以機械主義的理性代替人性的理性與感性，這並不完全符合現實中的人際族際國際關係。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;當然，我並不是要否定人際族際國際關係中存在博弈、對抗甚至零和的一面，並不否認相關關係中存在廣泛的爾虞我詐、陰險與暴力（甚至恰恰相反，我很確定這些的存在，以及其歷史及現實中對人類社會關係的支配作用）。典型的例如美蘇、印巴等國之間及世界各核大國之間的核威懾，即是「黑暗森林威懾」的現實版。在現實生活中，也有從官員到普通職員中，各方拿着對方「黑材料」以互相要挾的情形。人與人之間往往也都存在着基於實力、未知、心術等的博弈、鬥爭的得失。可以説，「黑暗森林」的許多情形早已在地球的國與國、羣體與羣體、人與人之間發生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;只是，這並不是全部，只是一部分、一個側面。更重要的是，惡的東西是現實，但是不代表它是合理的應當的，更不應該提倡這種惡。劉慈欣的《三體》將這一側面放大為社會關係的全部，並且將之視為存亡的基礎和博弈的準則加以肯定，並暗示只有如此之惡、失去人性摒棄溫情，才能保住人類文明。這是在毒害人心、破壞善意和信任，讓人民不再去探求一種更加合理的解決爭端和生存生活方式，將人們真的引向黑暗森林法則思想指導的社會環境之中。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，我們也不能否定這種情況的客觀存在，不能放棄使用籌碼保留威懾能力的必要性。這的確也就陷入了「黑暗森林」的巢窠，但我們的確無法完全脫離這樣的現實。只有用劍與盾護住的花，才能長久開放。只是，我們不要徹底迷失和沉醉在這種「黑暗森林」式的社會關係之中。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（七）大低谷之後到星際艦隊毀滅、威懾紀元後期這兩個時期&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;這兩段歲月被劉慈欣描述的十分美好，物質豐盈、社會和諧，人的權利與自由得到了充分的尊重。比如，全自動化、數字化帶來的高度人性化的生活方式；對「面壁計劃」產生的人權侵犯、權力濫用、不受監督情況的譴責和終止；生活中發生意外情況均可以得到經濟賠償；銀行為冬眠者提供優厚的鉅額的存款利息……總之，讓人們可以舒適的、有尊嚴的活着。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，這一切又是欲抑先揚，或者説是為後面的悲劇做鋪墊。在劉筆下這時的人們，已經對人類自身的文明變得過度自信，並且因此生髮出過多的同情心同理心，喪失了警惕性與危機意識，並最終導致後來星際艦隊的覆滅，以及威懾紀元之前那段人類處於絕望中的痛苦。而對威懾紀元後期（至威懾失效時）的描繪也異曲同工。在此摘取幾個典型段落予以分析。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在星際艦隊接觸三體派來的「水滴」之前，有這麼一段描寫：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「公眾對三體世界的感情，開始由敵視和仇恨轉向同情、憐憫甚至敬佩。人們同時也意識到這樣一個事實：三體世界的十個水滴在兩個世紀前就發出了，而人類直到現在才真正理解了它們的含義，這固然因為三體文明的行為過分含蓄，也從另一個方面反映了人類被自己的血腥歷史所扭曲的心態。在全球網上的公民投票中，陽光計劃的支持率急劇上升，且有越來越多的人傾向於把火星作為三體居留地的強生存方案。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;這段話集中反映了人類在大低谷結束並進行「第二次啓蒙運動/文藝復興/大革命」、「給歲月以文明」後，人類對三體問題及三體世界看法的根本轉變。而這種轉變的原因，正是自己物質豐富、軍事強大、思想文明的產物。人類處境的改變、社會再度高度文明化，讓人類由對三體世界恐懼、敵對和保持高度警惕，變成了一種同情憐憫。這時人類的心態，與後面發生的星際艦隊被幾乎全殲時的絕望，形成了鮮明的對比。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;以這段描寫史強所在地區政府會議中官員的態度為例：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「這是小區政府的一次會議，區行政官員都到了，冬眠者約佔三分之二，其餘是現代人。現在可以很清楚地把他們區分開來：雖然都處於極度的抑鬱狀態，但冬眠者官員都在低沉的情緒中保持着常態，而現代人則都或多或少地表現出崩潰的跡象，會議開始以來，他們的情緒已多次失控，史曉明的話再次觸碰了他們脆弱的神經。區最高行政長官淚痕未乾，又捂着臉哭了起來，引得另外幾名現代人官員同他一起哭；主管地區教育的官員則歇斯底里地大笑，還有一個現代人痛苦地咆哮起來，向地上摔杯子……」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;官員尚且如此，何況平民百姓。後面還用幾萬人集體淫亂、羅輯先被膜拜後被驅逐等描寫，反映了人類的絕望。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;人類心態由絕望到自信再到絕望，這跌宕起伏令人唏噓。在自信時對三體世界的那種「憐憫」，也成了巨大的笑話、人類給自己的殘酷諷刺。以善意揣度對手，卻落得面臨毀滅的結局。地球艦隊覆滅，很大程度正是在於人類的輕敵和輕信。這種輕信也來源於人們生活在文明歲月已久，對宇宙的險惡喪失了警惕，把敵人想的太美好、仁慈了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣對人類善良卻被欺騙、善意導致災禍的譏諷，並未到此為止，相反，《三體》中的人類在此後又重複了一次這樣的悲劇，也就是威懾紀元後期發生的那段歷史。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;人類在地球艦隊覆滅和殘存艦隊自相殘殺後，本已十分絕望，只等着地球被侵佔、人類在不能生育的情況下消亡。但科學家、面壁人羅輯卻巧妙利用「雪地工程」，設置了向宇宙發射太陽系及三體星系位置的系統，並以此成功迫使三體世界放棄對地球的入侵。此後，三體與地球達成和平協定，地球和三體互相傳遞自己的先進知識，允許地球設立數個可發射可引至黑暗森林打擊的「咒語」的威懾系統，雙方實現了類似於「核威懾」的平衡。人類終於轉危為安。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，威懾形成、重歸安全之後，人類再一次「不安分」了起來。程心在公元紀年冬眠，威懾紀年 61 年甦醒，醒來後她就看見電視上有人在譴責羅輯涉嫌「世界滅絕罪」。緊接着，她被公眾擁護成為「執劍人」。而公眾擁護她的原因之一，則是對羅輯這樣冷酷的執劍人感到恐懼，以及對羅輯所代表的絕對權力的恐懼：&lt;strong&gt;「羅輯的形象由救世主一天一天地變成了一個不可理喻的怪物和毀滅世界的暴君」&lt;/strong&gt;。人們又由集中於解決基本生存轉變為關注人權、反對極權統治。於是，就需要換下羅輯這樣的人（更不願意要維德、曹彬那樣「野蠻」的公元人），選擇程心這樣心地善良、代表着愛與和平的女性承擔這種威懾任務。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;正如這段描寫：&lt;strong&gt;「看，她是聖母瑪麗亞，她真的是！」年輕母親對人羣喊道，然後轉向程心，熱淚盈眶地雙手合十，「美麗善良的聖母，保護這個世界吧，不要讓那些野蠻的嗜血的男人毀掉這美好的一切。」&lt;/strong&gt;人們已經將地球艦隊覆滅的慘痛拋之腦後，對美好和善良的追求再次超過了對生存安危的重視。在新老執劍人交接後，羅輯還被以「世界滅絕罪」拘捕了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;僅僅在程心持有發射作為威懾、面對三體世界入侵時應該發射的引力波信號的按鈕十五分鐘後，三體的「水滴」就向發射器撲去。無法面對兩個星球毀滅結果的程心放棄發射會導致兩個星系暴露和毀滅的引力波信號，三體的入侵已不可避免。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，呈平日久的人們並沒有表現出特別的恐慌。當三體世界要求人們移民澳大利亞時，大家都沒有響應。&lt;strong&gt;「直到這時，人們仍然幻想着至少一代人的平安生活，所以在智子的講話發表後，沒有一個國家響應，更沒有人開始移民。」&lt;/strong&gt;人類還抱有鴕鳥的僥倖心理，直到「水滴」襲擊了幾座城市，造成 30 多萬人死亡，人們才在恐懼中開始了遷徙。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，人們的僥倖心理還沒有徹底破滅。人們還相信智子所説的，&lt;strong&gt;「三體艦隊到達後，完全有能力使澳大利亞的四十億人過上舒適的生活。同時，佔領者還將幫助人類建造火星和太空中的居住空間，在艦隊到達五年後就可以向火星和太空大規模移民，十五年後就能基本完成。那時，人類將擁有相對而言足夠大的生存空間，兩個文明將在太陽系開始新的和平生活。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;然而三體世界並不給人類存活的機會，而是一步步摧毀人類的抵抗能力、生存能力。在人們繳械、移民後，摧毀澳大利亞的工業和基礎設施。再然後，就是切斷電力和農業生產能力，逼迫「人相食」。&lt;strong&gt;「智子環視大廳中所有的人，「糧食？這不都是糧食？每個人看看你們的周圍，都是糧食，活生生的糧食。」&lt;/strong&gt;這時的人類才知道什麼是你死我活的鬥爭。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;借智子之口説的這段話，可以反映劉慈欣對人類生存問題的看法：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「生存本來就是一種幸運，過去的地球上是如此，現在這個冷酷的宇宙中也到處如此。但不知從什麼時候起，人類有了一種幻覺，認為生存成了唾手可得的東西，這就是你們失敗的根本原因。進化的旗幟將再次在這個世界升起，你們將為生存而戰，我希望在座的每個人都在那最後的五千萬人之中，希望你們能吃到糧食，而不是被糧食吃掉。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;劉慈欣描繪的人類兩起兩落的過程，是令人震撼的。他所描繪的人類在安全幸福時滋生的同情心、對警惕的放鬆，瀕臨滅亡時人類的絕望與狂亂，以及三體一步步將人類逼入滅絕境地的巧妙設計，都很能反映人性的弱點。像人類在澳大利亞被三體設計滅絕（未遂）的過程，與包括羅馬人屠滅迦太基城、靖康之難（金軍攻克開封）、南京大屠殺等各種屠殺的過程頗為類似（可以看看相關的記述，然後對比。或者劉慈欣就是看過這些記述才寫出來《三體》中類似情節的）。這都體現了劉慈欣對人性、人的心理、對人類歷史上生存鬥爭殘酷性的深刻認識和生動詮釋。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;這一節內容，我是對劉慈欣的有相當程度的正面評價的。但是本文主要是為了批評，這一段當然也有需要批評的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;其實以上這些內容，也就是劉慈欣黑暗森林理論的延續及具體化。劉慈欣的這些描述和分析確實很深刻，也與人類部分歷史與現實相吻合。但是，正如前面説過的（後面也還要多次説），劉慈欣在準確描繪了某種黑暗事實的同時，卻將這種黑暗合理化，並且暗示甚至明示這種現實的不可更改性，傳達出一種只有放棄善良與同情心、選擇殘酷與狠毒才能得以生存的價值觀。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;同樣的事實與道理，用不同的感情傾向、描寫側重點，就導向不同的結論、達至迥然相異的目的。而根據劉慈欣字裏行間的描述，以及結合全書乃至其個人在其他場合的言行，足以得出其主張在人際族際國際關係及競爭事物中摒棄善意、以惡度人、廣用詐術、心狠手辣的結論。除此之外，他還藉此想表達或暗示其他一些東西，放到後面再説。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在描述這部分內容時，其中還有一段耐人尋味的話：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「有學者認為，科學技術一度是消滅極權的力量之一，但當威脅文明生存的危機出現時，科技卻可能成為催生新極權的土壤。在傳統的極權中，獨裁者只能通過其他人來實現統治，這就面臨着低效率和無數的不確定因素，所以，在人類歷史上，百分之百的獨裁體制從來沒有出現過。但技術卻為這種超級獨裁的實現提供了可能，面壁者和持劍者都是令人憂慮的例子。超級技術和超級危機結合，有可能使人類社會退回黑暗時代。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;很難判斷劉慈欣這段話實際上所想表達的意思。根據劉慈欣慣常表現的政治觀點，他並不反對現在中國的極權主義。不過這段話描寫的情況卻與最近十幾年中國的現實非常相似。這段話很精準的論述了科技與極權主義關係的演變。互聯網出現時，人們都以為將打破信息封鎖促進自由民主，然而如今科技極權、數字極權卻在包括中國在內的許多國家建立，包括民主國家也無法逃脫監視主義的幽靈。而中國等專制威權國家在新冠疫情下利用科技進行的高強度管控，以及未來在遏制氣候變暖中各國所必須採用的集權與數字化管理，這兩個事例都高度符合劉慈欣所説「威脅文明生存危機出現時，科技可能成為催生新極權土壤」的論斷。那麼劉慈欣對這種科技極權是否贊同呢？這是個不太好判斷的問題，或者説劉對此並非簡單的贊同或反對。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（八）託馬斯維德&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;對這個人物的塑造，最能反映劉慈欣的社會達爾文主義思想，也可窺見劉慈欣對人的品質、價值的判斷標準。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;託馬斯維德出場後的第一句話，就足夠震撼：&lt;strong&gt;「你會把你媽賣給妓院嗎？」維德問&lt;/strong&gt;（問程心）。通過這句震撼的話和側面描寫，就把一個冷酷殘忍的情報人員形象刻畫了出來，也顯露了維德兇陰的性格特徵。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;為達目的不擇手段是社會達爾文主義的典型特徵，劉慈欣借維德之口有力的説了出來：&lt;strong&gt;他突然一改一貫沉穩冷淡的語調，像發狂的野獸般聲嘶力竭地咆哮起來，「前進！前進！！不擇手段地前進！！！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;當發送人類去接觸三體世界的計劃因運載重量限制而受阻時，維德冷酷的説了句「&lt;strong&gt;只送大腦&lt;/strong&gt;」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;還有這段側面描寫：&lt;strong&gt;「有兩個顯然也是公元人的男犯人衝程心輕佻地打口哨，但看到程心要找的人後他們立刻變得老實了，都趕緊垂頭幹活，好像對剛才的舉動有些後怕。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心看到這人（維德）第一眼時就知道，他沒有放棄，他的野心和理想，他的陰險，還有許許多多程心從來不知道的東西，什麼都沒有放棄。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;當然，僅僅這些還不能完全刻畫出維德的冷酷殘忍。劉慈欣後面還有更多筆墨在刻畫維德。但僅僅從這幾句，就可以讓人們明白維德是個怎樣的性格、形象、特質的人物了。維德這樣的人物並非只是文學形象，現實中也頗有類似的真實的人。大到一個國家的領袖，小到地方豪強、黑幫首領，乃至學校和單位裏既心狠手辣又有手段實力底氣的人物，都與維德的某些側面甚至整個形象吻合。一般人接觸到這樣的人物，免不了前胸後背頭上腳下都冒冷汗，不自覺的就對其產生畏懼，即便是有些心氣和能力的人也會在這樣的陰狠者面前萎縮幾分。如果你一開始沒有怕他，那他對你施展一些招數之後，那你會比一般人對其更加恐懼敬畏。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而劉慈欣刻畫的維德這樣的人物，卻是人類的救世主，或者説起碼是救世主之一。維德不僅推動了階梯計劃，將雲天明的大腦送向三體世界，最重要的是研究了光速飛船，讓人類保留了生命的火種。而且如果不是程心中間造成的「破壞」，維德和其他人完全可能將人類帶出被二維化的險境，甚至一開始就不會讓三體得以打破威懾威脅地球，後來一切災難也不會發生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣把一個魔鬼般的人物賦予具有天使般的拯救力，正是想表達他借維德之口説出的&lt;strong&gt;「失去人性，失去很多；失去獸性，失去一切」，以及「不擇手段的前進」。&lt;/strong&gt;或者將兩句話摺合，就是説只有不擇手段、不顧人性人權才能勝利，顧忌道德和手段、被人性人權束縛，那就只能失敗。這是典型的社會達爾文主義觀點，或者説不僅是社會達爾文主義觀點，而是社達主義中最為陰惡的那一面，即邪必勝正、祛善揚惡才能生存。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;這一點在劉慈欣的三體全篇中有許多出展現，對維德的刻畫描寫則是這種觀點的集中體現。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;那麼，這樣的觀點對嗎？如果我們縱觀人類乃至萬物歷史，這在很大程度的確是一個客觀現實。不談別的只談人類，歷史上野蠻戰勝文明的例子更多，還是文明消滅野蠻的更多？無疑是前者。精緻雅典亡於精悍斯巴達，羅馬亡於蠻族入侵，宋明亡於金元和滿清，都是眾所周知的事例。即便那些自詡文明也的確開創了文明的力量，其崛起與輝煌又何嘗不是建立在野蠻殘暴、不擇手段之上的呢？對古羅馬來説，背信棄義的在迦太基人解除武裝後將之屠滅，是其稱霸地中海的關鍵；李世民先發制人（當然某些史料看是「自衞反擊」，只不過……），發動玄武門之變殺死李建成李元吉及其子嗣，才有了後來「天可汗」的貞觀之治。除了這些恢宏的歷史，市井之中又有多少「好人不長壽，壞人害千年」的例證呢？「卑鄙是卑鄙者的通行證、高尚是高尚者的墓誌銘」，早就有人對此做過精闢深刻的總結。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;所以，劉慈欣借維德之口所説的，某種程度確實是現實。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;可現實並不代表正確、應當。相反，人類文明發展至今，恰恰是在一次次對野蠻的鞭撻、對醜惡的克服中實現的。如果沒有對惡的批判與剋制，人類如今還在日復一日的相互攻伐中，斬首截肢炮烙凌遲還是家常便飯，人類也不可能沐浴在相對的和平與發展之中。正是無數人對於善的堅守，才讓惡一步步被限制和壓縮，起碼大惡大禍只在少部分地區少部分人那裏不幸的發生，而大多數人都可以相對和平寧靜的度過人生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;所以，劉慈欣在三體中所暗示甚至宣揚的極端社達主義觀點（沒錯，是極端社達而不是一般社達），我們只能「揚棄」，知其現實性但更要遏制其現實性，認識到不擇手段的可怕後更要堅守良知和理性，去抑制醜惡的滋長與殘忍的再生。我們即便是惡留下的產物，也不應該延續惡以生存。就像某種程度，我們都是遠古至近現代各種強姦行為（或者準確説是非自願性行為）而產生的後代（誰敢説自己所有祖先都是合意性交的產物嗎？），我們都是強姦犯的後人，但是我們肯定不應該謳歌讚頌強姦，而是堅決的批判與唾棄之。像日本 731 部隊和納粹德國進行的活人人體實驗，都取得了非常巨大的醫學、科學研究成果，並且造福着現在的人類，但這完全不能因此而為之粉飾美化、不能將其正當和合理化，更不能允許類似暴行再次發生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣並不是（或者起碼不會公開承認是）極端社達主義主張的宣揚者，但是在客觀上無疑是暗示甚至説明示了這樣的價值取向和價值選擇。與歐美乃至中國許多描繪黑暗和壞人不擇手段的文學藝術作品不同，那些作品是為了鞭撻醜惡謳歌正義，而劉的《三體》卻是在描繪黑暗與不擇手段的同時千方百計進行合理化甚至頌揚，將之表現為一種悲壯的、偉大的、對延續人類生存發展而言唯一可解的價值與實踐。這就很值得警惕與批判了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;關於劉的社達主義價值觀，我還會在後面再做批判，現在回到對維德的評論上來。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣對維德這個人物的刻畫也是很正面的，他雖然描繪了此人那麼多兇惡陰險之處，但是都是為了襯託其目的的偉大、方向的正確、行為的正當。而且，劉慈欣所描繪的維德所作所為都不是為了維德自己，而是都關係到人類的前途命運，維德成了一個談不上「毫不利己」但明顯「利人類」、不是「一身正氣」但明顯「兩袖清風」的英雄人物，所做一切都不是私利而是出於公心。而且這樣的英雄人物既讓他人懼怕，但是自己卻從不對任何壓力低頭、不畏懼諂媚任何人乃至外星生物（例如在被智子監視、人人小心翼翼的情況下大膽發言，反而故意利用這種監視），是不折不扣的大英雄。這讓他一切「反人類」、「反人權」的行為看起來更加正義、無私、必要。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但現實裏，像維德這樣形象的人真是如此始終正直、執着、堅定、硬骨頭嗎？從某些方面看或者表面看的確如此，我上面説的從國家元首到黑幫頭子，再到學校單位裏的狠人，往往也都是威風八面，頗為強悍幹練，無所畏懼。可其中絕大多數人（除非真的天下無敵）在面對比起更「硬」更「牛」的人物時，其卑躬屈膝程度往往勝於常人，因為他比常人更知道自己同類有多可怕、比自己強的同類多麼不能得罪。而他們面對體制，雖然有時會做出挑釁、反叛之舉以對他人顯示其強悍、展示力量或僅僅為了自己的舒爽，但更多時候則會服從體制、諂媚體制，對有強制力為後盾的制度和規則有一種異乎尋常的虔敬。因為他們知道，體制的能量是無窮大的，是其個人可以利用卻不能推翻的。他們絕不是對任何人、在任何事上都腰桿硬直、不卑而亢，而是由於其人格特質和生存需要，比一般人更加欺軟怕硬、見風使舵、精緻利己。貝利亞、戈林這樣的人像不像維德？他們在斯大林、希特勒面前又是怎樣一副德性（當然他們在後者們臨死前又換了一副德性）？他們面對邪惡的制度和環境，是反叛與對抗，還是屈從和利用？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;還有，即便託馬斯維德成為（代表）斯大林、毛澤東、希特勒、普京那樣的最高領袖、獨裁者（而非打手），又真的是純潔勇敢的嗎？根據現在披露的各種資料，他們很多時候遠比民主國家領袖更加恐懼和虛弱。如斯大林在德國入侵時、去世之前，都表現出恐懼之情，死亡時也不真的「虎死不倒架」。電影《斯大林之死》雖有些戲劇化，但反映的事實基本無誤。而毛澤東呢？李志綏的披露並不是孤證，而是可以和多方信息驗證，且記錄的真誠性黎安友等知名主流學者肯定。而普京在入侵烏克蘭遭遇挫敗後的表現，也能看出這種「硬漢」的色厲內荏。而劉慈欣塑造的託馬斯維德的形象，其實與這些獨裁者表面的形象如剛毅勇敢等特徵相似，卻有意迴避這樣的人內心的虛弱和恐懼。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;還有，維德這樣的人真的清廉、不利己、為理想獻身嗎？也真有這樣的人，可鳳毛麟角。絕大多數像他們這樣思想和行為的人並不比普通人更少慾望，且其能力手段足以得到更多非法利益，他們又怎能如柳下惠般在權力金錢美色中潔身自好？還是拿那些道貌岸然、冷酷無情的布黨高層和納粹人士為例，如雅戈達、戈培爾，看看關於他們的史書和回憶錄，就知道他們比一眼可知的齷齪之人要更齷齪、明目張膽貪淫的人更貪淫（當然相比而言布黨比納粹更加心口不一和無恥貪婪）。他們會為人民奉獻犧牲嗎？或許某個時間點會的，但是肯定是其貪淫享樂之後，以及使用各種損人利己的方式去奉獻犧牲的，絕不會像《三體》中那樣悲壯的犧牲。納粹和蘇聯的覆滅及曝出的內幕，也證明瞭其犧牲捍衞的並不是值得的東西，而是骯髒透頂。或者説像東條英機、乃木希典，這些人確實是挺無私奉獻的，可是是用幾千萬中國人、美國人、俄國人/蘇聯人的生命掙得的他們的「無私」及對日本人的「偉大」。我們難道要這樣的人嗎？（最重要的是，這世界並非只有這種奉獻和存活方式）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;可劉慈欣並不描繪這些，而是將維德以及前面的史強，描寫成很清廉、寡慾、不會畏懼、不諂媚的人。當然這可以説是因為他們的操行並不是《三體》的重點，所以沒必要寫他們的貪婪、畏懼、諂媚那一面。於是，維德這樣殘忍酷虐的人物才反而顯得對人類來説十分偉大，史強那樣的形象也顯得雖不完美但更完整真實。如果劉慈欣寫出了這些人貪婪、畏懼、諂媚，其良好的形象就會坍塌，失去了劉慈欣和社達主義者所認為的人物應有的（至少表面上要有的）那套道德操行，就無法塑造出他們心目中理想的那種英雄了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;這又是當今中國文宣體制下描述歷史人物的方式。以前也就是「前三十年」尤其文革那十年，對大人物、正面人物一律以「偉光正」形象示人，沒有半點缺點（頂多會有一點平易近人的描寫）。而現在不同，對於那些偉人、英雄、正面人物，會有意突出其一些野性、刁蠻、低素質、知識貧乏等特性，但是同時又在涉及根本廉恥的「大節」上絕不「抹黑」，這樣讓正面形象更加人性化、真實、有血有肉。可這種人性化、真實、有血有肉，其實是迴避了許多其更多更重要的作惡甚至犯罪的事實的，是用小的「毛病」遮蓋真正的齷齪骯髒，用戲劇化的頑劣帶過血淋淋赤裸裸的暴行。這種描繪我在本文前面涉及「毛澤東批示」那點就提到了，劉對維德、史強這種人物的描繪方式，立場和動機與之一脈相承。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣刻畫的維德這樣的人物，及其他與之相關的描寫敍述，都在強化「不擇手段的前進」和「失去獸性、失去一切」的觀點。劉不僅是在描述一種客觀事實，還有主觀上的贊成與褒揚，這是其與其他傳世文學佳品最大不同之處，也是其最值得批判之處。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;還有，前面已經提到，劉慈欣描繪的維德和史強這樣的人物，代表的是統治機構的暴力機器（或者説是他們其中之一員），是體制的維護者，而不是林沖、楊志、魯智深這樣的體制的反叛者、與國家暴力機器相對抗者。劉慈欣在《三體》中，對於葉文潔等受害者和反叛者頗有微詞，但是對於人類秩序的捍衞者則不吝讚美，這也可以反映劉慈欣骨子裏的保守主義特質及《三體》的保守主義立場。他們確實是社會達爾文主義者，但是其社達不是為了變革，而是為了讓舊秩序更加穩固。這更顯出劉慈欣及《三體》價值觀的醜惡和反動。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;十分諷刺的一點是，劉慈欣及《三體》的這種捍衞體制和舊秩序的保守反動，與其所讚揚的毛澤東所持的反傳統反秩序思想形成鮮明對比。劉慈欣在書中和採訪場合多次對毛澤東有所讚美（或起碼在提及時不貶抑批判）。毛澤東罪惡罄竹難書，文革也是亙古未有之浩劫，但是恰恰有一點可取的，就是其對體制性壓迫的反抗、對傳統秩序和思想意識的反叛（雖然這個過程及之後建立了惡劣的體制、更暴虐的秩序，也造成了更殘酷的壓迫，但前面畢竟是在對不合理的乃至醜惡的舊規則舊秩序舊道統的反叛和反抗），一種打破舊巢窠束縛的反抗精神。這可謂是毛時代文革酷虐中唯一的亮色。劉慈欣一再為毛澤東貼金、為文革作惡者及相關體制和組織洗地，卻與毛主義及文革中唯一可取可敬之處背道而馳，可知其與人道主義及進步潮流多麼「恰巧」的完全相逆，又與醜惡反動保守多麼高度一致。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（九）程心&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心，是劉慈欣着墨最多、被《三體》及劉慈欣粉絲批判最狠、本書爭議最大的人物。簡單來説，她就是託馬斯·維德的反面，當然詳細説那就複雜多了。這個人物非常重要，也是書評的重點，所以還是要詳細説。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「聖母」，是《三體》及劉慈欣粉絲最常稱呼程心的詞彙。當然，這並不是讚美，而是深深的鄙夷。如果瞭解中國互聯網語境，就會知道，「聖母」這個詞在中國網絡上不僅不是好詞，還是個特別有惡意的詆譭謾罵之詞。這同樣是和高度社會達爾文主義化的中國現實高度相關的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;不過，「聖母」這個詞在中國互聯網上的本意，倒和西方並沒有特別大的差別，都是指愛心氾濫、對一切都愛與包容、反對所有仇恨和壓迫的人，只是中國和西方對這種人的態度不同（好吧，準確説是「部分中國人與部分西方人對這種人的態度不同」）。在中國，這種「聖母」的定義中還包括不分是非、沒有黑白對錯觀念、沒有立場和原則、一味輸出愛心和同情心的特點。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;中國人是恨透了這樣的人。他們認為這種「聖母」只會壞事，出賣自己國家民族羣體的利益，最終害人害己。在中國這個叢林社會，也的確會經常出現這種後果。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我總説中國、中國，難道世界不是這樣嗎？西方發達國家不是嗎？世界的確到處存在忘恩負義、恩將仇報，西方也不乏各種「農夫與蛇」的故事在現實上演。我在前文一再説這個世界仍然是叢林世界。但是這並不代表世界上所有事情都是這樣、世界所有地區所有羣體都是這樣的價值觀和行為方式生活的，有和中國並不一樣（哪怕根本上「質」一樣，但是「量」上有很大區別）的、「聖母」很多且可以好心得好報的社會的。被他們攻擊詆譭的西歐和美國左派中起碼很大一部分就是如此。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;可是中國人對此沒有同情支持，而是更加憤恨。不知道是嫉妒還是不相信，或者兼而有之（沒錯，這兩個看起來不能同時對同一個對象兼而有之的，中國人能（又要更正下，是「部分中國人」能））。他們不願意相信這世界上真有愛與和平，或者説極為嫉恨，於是瘋狂攻擊各種他們認為的「白左」、「聖母」乃至這樣的虛構人物形象。而《三體》中的程心就是靶子之一。當然，痛恨程心的還有一種人，這種人後面再説。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心這個名字一出現（人物還未正式出場），就被讀者謾罵（當然這是因為他們已經提前知道了後面的一些內容，或者讀過了又從頭看起，然後又在這裏作注）。而她正式出場，也就是在雲天明要被安樂死（未遂）的時候。她救下了雲天明，然後説了句「你知道嗎？安樂死是為你準備的」。這句話被無數人噴了無數次無形的唾沫。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;當然，看這個情節，程心是該被噴被罵，因為她做了一件缺德的事。但是如果是其他人，維德、史強、章北海、羅輯做的，這些人也就不會如此謾罵了，甚至覺得是其舍小取大的果斷行為。然而程心不能這樣做，因為她是「聖母」，有了道德枷鎖，再做什麼都要被檢視。當了好人就不能幹這種事，否則就是「虛偽」、「雙標」，哪怕其遠遠不如批判者虛偽和雙標。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;説到這，很多人一定覺得我這是故意在較真，一個故事情節罷了，讀者也只不過是在為虛構的故事而謾罵，也就圖個發泄而已。如果真是這樣，我也就沒必要説這些，甚至整篇文章也都沒必要寫了。事實當然不是這樣而是相反的，文學作品及與讀者的互動，深刻反映着現實世界及現實中人的判斷與選擇。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心參與「階梯計劃」那一部分，倒是沒人噴程心，這些技術問題上也沒什麼可噴的，相反人們應該對其技術水平感到佩服（但是這不影響後面繼續噴她），甚至還有人為劉慈欣描述的女性刻板印象而進行批評。這在中國讀者中倒是少見的現象，或者後來才逐漸出現。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;然後，就是程心知道雲天明給他送星星，然後竭力阻止雲天明被「安樂死」然後未果的情節。程心知道了雲天明對她的愛，於是想挽回一切，這順理成章，也説明她前面讓雲天明安樂死並不是負心之人而是無心之過。可是，這裏又是對她「虛偽」的一片罵聲。她真的虛偽嗎？顯然不是。真正想譴責，不是應該譴責不擇手段、明知雲天明是程心所愛還要為完成任務（或者故意如此做一個不可笑的惡作劇）的維德嗎？當然，這樣説又會讓大家覺得我太較真、沒意思了。但是我覺得那些批判程心忽視維德的，在現實裏大抵也是這麼做的。譴責一個老好人沒什麼風險，去攻擊有攻擊性的人就麻煩了。而且還是前面説的，人們總是對好人求全責備，對壞人就是「他壞在情理之中沒必要譴責」了。人們對藝術人物的看法，一直都是現實裏的反映，只不過有時候會誇張一些，但是本質還是現實的映射。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心下一個被嘲諷的切入點，是她參與競選執劍人並當選。人們將代表愛與和平的她選為執劍人，取代了已變得嚴肅堅韌的羅輯（以前他是玩世不恭的），更沒有選擇和維德類似的曹彬、畢雲峯等人。於是這就埋下了人類喪失對三體世界威懾力的禍根。而程心在三體探測器「水滴」攻擊威懾設施時的懦弱，猶疑，則成了讀者密集嘲諷謾罵的焦點區域。這段表現，也是程心被攻擊謾罵譏諷的核心因素，即她這種「聖母」的愛心與軟弱是會壞事的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;其實，我倒對這段內容中對程心的嘲諷謾罵很能理解，也比較贊同。劉慈欣編排這段內容，某種程度也確實是有很大合理性的。對於那些被認為是「白左」、「聖母」的人，這的確是其致命缺點，雖然未必是其中每個人都有的致命缺點。善良之人總是不想傷害別人，更不願意去毀滅、同歸於盡，甚至想犧牲自己成就他人。而如果其肩負着一個國家、民族的興亡，那這種行為就會導致全國全民族的集體沉淪或毀滅。這也的確是良善者的弱點，也是陰狠者的優勢。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;可還是像我前面所説的，這是事實，但應該如此嗎？為了勝利，我們一定要變成惡人嗎？並不見得。我們並不是不能培養出「行霹靂手段，保菩薩心腸」的人，現實中也並不乏這樣的人。二戰期間，德日軍隊兇殘無比，而美軍則被視為「少爺兵」，可美軍最終戰勝了日軍，德軍在西線的失敗美軍也是首功。這和武器裝備有關，但是美軍也沒普遍貪生怕死。至於當今的「白左」政治家，很多時候只是想恪守原則不讓國家世界陷入冤冤相報、以暴制暴的惡性循環罷了，真的動起手來那些兇頑殘暴之輩未必是對手。甚至，「白左」在正義信念下更加堅定。三百年前的羅伯斯庇爾不是「白左」嗎？照樣讓頑固保守的舊貴族紛紛斷頭。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;當然，像程心這樣性格和價值選擇的人，的確不適合承擔這種需要殺伐果斷的任務。人類如果都變得軟弱，喪失了警惕性與戰鬥性，也確實可能被那時還殘存的少數瘋狂頑固之徒「團滅」。劉慈欣的本意不見得是好的，但是客觀上提醒了我們，在持守善意之時，也不要放下手中的劍。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;不過，從另一個角度説，以死相搏甚至同歸於盡，是否真是最好的選擇（無論對自己還是對整個社會乃至對對手），或者這種心態博弈是否最好的威懾？大多數《三體》和劉慈欣粉絲都會説「是」，我的看法則在是非間搖擺。確實，越是抱定同歸於盡的方式，越是可能在博弈中勝出，這就是「看誰先慫」遊戲的核心。但是如果沒有人肯低頭，那這個世界就會在不斷耍弄這種遊戲中毀滅。或者，各方都會因此絞盡腦汁強化自己、削弱對方，不惜代價不擇手段，人類喪失良知、對對方趕盡殺絕或者絕對壓制，道理永遠幹不過拳頭，仇恨與弱肉強食在智力加持下膨脹，人類世界會變得比動物叢林更叢林。至於威懾平衡，有永遠的平衡嗎？不會有失控的一刻嗎？這樣的世界真的好嗎？誰能肯定自己是最終勝利者？或者説有最終勝利者嗎？那些失敗者就應該仰勝利者鼻息而活嗎？這是我們追求的人類文明世界嗎？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是如果不這樣做，那這樣做的人就會勝利，就會統治羣體、區域、國家、世界。那樣的世界，當然是地獄。所以，為了對抗魔鬼，自己也不得不成為魔鬼。只是希望是個還不那麼惡的魔鬼，或者最好是有魔鬼的手段但是卻有天使的心靈。可天使的心靈在這樣的博弈和生存競爭中怎可能不被污染？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心下一個被嘲諷攻擊的點，與前面的原因大同小異。程心阻止了維德等人研究光速飛船，要他們放棄與政府的對抗放下武器。而這，也就註定了人類幾乎全員的滅亡。而諷刺的是，她最後卻成了極少數沒有隨太陽系二維化的倖存者之一。她的阻止導致太陽系人類的幾乎全滅，卻得以逃生，不被罵才怪。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;可這同樣是她好心辦壞事。或者，正是她好心總是辦壞事，所以才更令人憎惡。如果是壞心辦壞事，像維德、葉文潔，人們反而不會那麼攻擊謾罵了。這又是前面説過的，不再絮叨了。在這一點上，她被罵也是理所應當。可是我還是想強調其好的初衷，因為「本意是好的」已經是現實世界中稀缺的東西了，而好心辦了壞事，並不總是會發生，甚至説很多情況下幾率還是低於 50% 的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;其實，劉慈欣文章中也寫了許多讓幾乎所有人都認為是程心正面的、閃光點的情節，例如放棄聯合國為購買雲天明送給自己的星星可以支付給她的鉅款而是選擇捐出、為責任冒險與雲天明見面、為宇宙重啓而放棄小宇宙來歸還宇宙質量，這些也都得到了很多讀者的稱讚。可是，為什麼還是有許多人謾罵程心？這兩波人有重合嗎？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;有部分重合。有些人就是可以將一個行為連貫的人割裂評價，肯定其某部分卻唾棄其另一部分。如果其一部分值得肯定，另一部分值得唾棄，那這樣當然可以且非常應該。但對不應當唾棄或者應該更加全面客觀評價的，卻一股腦否定，或者否定也否定不到點子上而是亂噴亂罵，就屬於愚蠢或者道德敗壞了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;還有一部分並不重合，其一以貫之對程心是謾罵的。除了前面我所説的嫉妒或者認為程心這種「聖母」不可信之外，還有一種原因，就更加可怕了。也就是那些惡人、惡棍，包括道貌岸然的保守主義者和青面獠牙的社會達爾文主義者。這些人謾罵程心及所有「白左」、「聖母」，是因為他們內心非常恐懼世界變的愛與和平、他們被排擠或者同化。為了他們自己繼續以惡生存下去、為了他們惡的價值觀永世長存，達到其各種現實利益和價值利益目的，他們要對「白左」、「聖母」百般詆譭、全面否定，批倒批臭，這樣他們所推崇的醜惡價值觀才能繼續大行於世，這些人也才能繼續如魚得水。這樣的人在世界很多，而在中國尤其多。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;值得一提的是，劉慈欣本人對他自己塑造的程心這個人物看法也頗為負面，不是説他不滿意於程心這個人物形象的塑造，而是説他就是反感程心這樣特質的人。所以，劉慈欣本人也屬於以上那些攻擊謾罵程心的人之一，且他的看法更加深刻（自己塑造的形象認識能不深刻嗎），所以他的陰惡也更可怖。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;最後説一下我對程心這樣的人的評價，我認為就是六四開，六分正（不是六分「對」）四分謬，其品質可嘉但價值選擇很多時候不可取。如果愛與和平能解決世上一切，天下大同早就實現了。為了正義，我們不得不做些不好的準備罷。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（十）性別偏見爭議&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣的《三體》出版後（尤其被翻譯成英語等外文並獲雨果獎之後），引發了很大的爭議。其中一項爭議，就是認為他在作品中有對女性的性別歧視和刻板偏見。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我在閲讀了全文後，發現的確是這樣的。我在前面已經説了他對葉文潔、紹琳及女紅衞兵的刻畫反映了歧視與偏見。其實何止如此，全書更多處及整體更是有着普遍的、明顯的性別歧視與偏見。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在全書中，劉慈欣刻畫了十多個主要人物形象，大多數是較為正面的人物（起碼這些人「本質是好人」），這些人大都在拯救地球中付出很多犧牲並做出卓越貢獻。而這些人物除了被設置為聯合國祕書長的薩伊為女性外，其餘均為男性，如羅輯、史強、章北海、託馬斯維德、曹彬、泰勒、雷迪亞茲、汪淼、常偉思等人。即便明顯屬於正面形象且有較大貢獻的薩伊，也屬於出場次數有限的配角。而為數不多負面的形象，則幾乎讓女性「包攬」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;除了我前面所説的女紅衞兵，後面還有專門對女性形象的醜化。在《三體》末尾部分，寫到太陽系二維化、程心和艾

乘坐光速飛船離開時，其他試圖逃離者發現他們時的情景：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「快看，那艘船怎麼加速那麼快？！」一個女人尖叫道。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「哦，天啊，裏面的人會被壓成肉膜的。」一個男人説。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;然後出現了另一個男人的聲音：「你們這些白癡，那樣的加速飛船也會被壓扁！可它沒有，那不是聚變發動機，那是空間曲率驅動！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「曲率引擎？！光速飛船？！光速飛船！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「看來傳聞是真的了，他們自己在祕密建造光速飛船，自己逃跑……」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「啊呀呀呀呀！啊！！啊！！！」這是第一個女人的聲音。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「前面的，攔截它！撞死它！！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;又是那個女人的聲音，「啊！他們能達到逃逸速度，他們能逃掉！他們能活！！啊啊啊！！我要光速飛船！！攔住它呀！掐死裏面的！！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;對女性的醜化不言而喻。此外，還有一些不為人注意的負面形象的小人物，例如驅趕走羅輯的居委會主任也是女性（當然現實中居委會主任大多數的確是女性）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;還有對女性的物化。例如羅輯的妻子莊顏，就是一個被高度物化的女性形象。當然，這不完全是刻板偏見，而是劉慈欣為劇情需要（如襯託羅輯性格及其變化）有意設計的人物形象。但是反過來説，其他醜化女性的人物和故事情節設置就不是必須的了，負麪人物不是必須設置為女性的了（可劉慈欣卻這樣設置了）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;程心這個「成事不足敗事有餘」的「聖母」形象，就是女性，而且書中若隱若現的暗示正是她的女性氣質（「聖母」），讓她「敗事」了。這在前面專門分析程心那一節已有闡述分析，就不重複了。程心也是劉慈欣在《三體》中，將性別歧視與刻板偏見滲透最悄然而深入的女性人物形象。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而與程心性格脾氣相反的女科學家柯曼琳，則是那種粗魯的、且還喜歡雌競（女人難為女人）的女人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「用資源改變原理？」一個叫柯曼琳的上了年紀的法國女人用輕蔑的口吻説，她是來自歐洲航天局的高級顧問，覺察到了男人們集中到程心身上的那種眼光，她感到很不舒服。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;又響起幾聲笑，柯曼琳笑得最響，「親愛的，你給我們提供了一個卡通式的場景……」在越來越多的笑聲中，她接着説，「你最好重做一遍大一的作業，算算推重比。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;男人們的目光依次從程心身上移開了，現在他們終於開始認真考慮她所説的話，對她的欣賞暫時顧不上了，只有柯曼琳始終盯着程心看，好像不認識她似的。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;她把文件舉了幾秒鐘，並沒有把它遞給誰，而是狠狠地摔在地上。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「見鬼！」柯曼琳氣急敗壞地大叫。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「你，還有你」，維德指指程心和柯曼琳，「以後不允許出現這樣沒有意義的精神失控」。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;由於篇幅問題及相關內容分佈的瑣碎，所以我無法將《三體》中所有對女性的歧視和偏見一一列舉，但是以上的例子已經足夠，其他的讀者們其實也都看過，並不需要我一一列舉和重複。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;這些可以説毫無疑問是性別歧視和偏見。但是，這是不是某種程度的客觀事實呢？即女性是否的確是這樣的？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;以我的個人意見，首先，根本上説，劉慈欣刻畫的這些女性的負面所作所為及負麪人格特質，尤其各種醜惡言行，是男女共有的，並非女性獨有。其次，的確在某些程度上某些情況下，女性在某些方面的確有一些與上述被醜化或刻板化的形象或言行等，存在某種有別於男性的特質。但是，程度遠沒有劉慈欣這樣刻畫的嚴重。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而且，究竟是她們天生就如此，還是男權社會將其塑造和規訓成這些樣子？這個問題很重要，非常重要。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我認為，這當然是後天社會環境塑造的結果，而非先天必然的情形。女性在有些事情中、情境下存在較突出的偏狹、反智、物化、柔弱，是被社會準確説是男權社會所製造、誘引、逼迫出來的，劉慈欣的《三體》就是參與製造、誘引、逼迫的其中一份子。這就像説「農民工文化素質低」，並不是農民工素質天生就低，而是他們往往處在惡劣的家庭、社會環境中，沒有條件得到良好的教育和良善的外部環境塑造，他們是受害者而不是天然的低素質劣根分子。我們要做的是同情和改變，以及對造成這種後果的人或制度環境進行譴責，而非對這些受害者鄙夷譏諷、指指點點。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;同理，女性出現一些偏狹、反智、物化、柔弱的特性，並不是歧視女性的理由，不是男權社會壓迫女性、歸罪女性的藉口，相反她們是受害者，她們這樣反而需要男權社會承擔責任，通過對制度、文化、習慣的改變，縮小甚至消除非生理的性別差異，實現真正的男女平等和性別正義。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;特別需要強調的是，我所説的男女在某些特質上的差異，其差異程度是遠小於男性內部、女性內部的差異的，也普遍小於不同教育水平、不同收入水平的羣體之間的差異。無論生理還是非生理方面，男女的共性都遠大於「個性」或者説特異性，非生理方面尤其如此。對性別差異，人們可以討論、有各自的觀點，但是不應該因此限制、迫害任何性別（包括跨性別者）的各種基本人權和學習工作生活各項事務中的自由選擇權。以這些非自願性差異來評斷、規訓、責備男女或其他任何性別/性別認同者，都是謬誤的、應被批判的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;那麼，《三體》中有這樣多的性別歧視和偏見，是不是代表劉慈欣本人有這樣的性別歧視和偏見呢？答案顯然是肯定的。劉慈欣在採訪中否認了這一點，但是其否認並不成立，因為與事實相違背。或者説，即便劉慈欣沒有主觀上歧視的故意，也有客觀上歧視的實質。劉慈欣在展示被認為在女性身上比較凸顯的某些特質時，顯然是歧視性的立場，而非認為需要同情和改變的態度，更不是為了特意以此揭露和批判男權社會對女性的影響和規訓。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;此外，劉慈欣還曾經在一場和學者江曉原的辯論中假設，如果世界末日，只剩下他、江曉原和現場一位女主持人，「我們三人攜帶着人類文明的一切，而我們必須吃了她才能夠生存下去，你吃嗎？」劉慈欣站在「吃」的一方。雖然這很大程度只是個假設，但劉在假設中將對象設置為「美女」（即便當時他們身邊確實有個女主持人），即一位女性，本身就含有將女性作為犧牲品的意思。即便不深究，這也足以反映劉慈欣對女性的某種不良的心理和價值取向。即便作為玩笑，也是不合適的。而且劉慈欣還認真的和江辯論，説明他並沒當成個玩笑，而是將假設當真的一般對待。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（十一）大眾的形象&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣在《三體》中，對人民大眾不僅沒有賦予團結、勇敢等特質，反而給予了極為強烈的貶低與鄙夷。在劉慈欣筆下，大眾是自私的、盲從的、虛弱的、野蠻的，是不折不扣的「烏合之眾」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;除了前文提及的紅衞兵批鬥葉哲泰、地球二維化時女逃難者喊叫，還有不少反映大眾劣性的情節。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;例如羅輯根據黑暗森林法則預測的一個恆星被摧毀，此事公開時正逢星際艦隊毀滅，大眾把羅輯當成神一樣的人進行朝拜以圖在危機中倖存：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「看到羅輯停下，人羣便向他移動過來，在距他兩三米處，前排的人極力阻擋住後麪人羣的推進，然後跪了下來，後面的人也相繼跪下，發光的人羣像從沙灘上退去的海浪般低了下去。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「主啊，救救我們吧！」羅輯聽到一個人説，他的話引起了一陣嗡嗡的共鳴。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「我們的神，拯救世界吧！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「偉大的代言人，主持宇宙的正義吧！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「正義天使，救救人類吧！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;……」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;當羅輯表現出無法解決危機後，人們對他的看法及對待他的方式發生 180 度大轉彎：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在一個冷雨霏霏的秋天的下午，新生活五區的居民代表會議做出了一個決定：將羅輯驅逐出小區，理由是他影響了該區居民的正常生活。在雪地工程期間，羅輯常常外出參加會議，但大部分時間還是在小區裏度過的，他就在自己的居所中同雪地工程的各個機構保持聯繫。羅輯恢復面壁者身份後，新生活五區就處於戒嚴之中，居民的生活和工作都受到影響。後來，隨着羅輯地位的衰落，對小區的戒嚴也漸漸鬆懈下來，但情況更糟：不時有城裏來的人聚集在羅輯所住的樓下，對他起鬨嘲罵，還向他的窗子扔石塊，而新聞媒體對這景象也很感興趣，往往來的記者和抗議者一樣多。但羅輯被驅逐的真正原因，還是冬眠者們心中對他徹底的失望。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;面對着這個已經耗盡了一切的人，主任並沒有絲毫的憐憫。和那個時代的其他人一樣，她總覺得不管世界多麼黑暗，總在冥冥之中的什麼地方存在着終極的公正，羅輯先是證實了她的感覺，然後又無情地打碎了它，對他的失望曾令她惱羞成怒，她冷冷地宣佈了會議決定。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「呀，他好像是面壁者呀！」於是孩子的父母也都回頭看他，他只好承認自己就是羅輯。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;這時，車內響起了《山楂樹》。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;車停了下來，「下去。」孩子的父親冷冷地説，母親和孩子看他的眼光也如外面的秋雨般冰涼。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;羅輯沒有動，他想聽那首歌。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「請下去。」那男人又説，羅輯讀出了他們目光中的含義：沒有救世的能力不是你的錯，但給世界以希望後又打碎它則是一種不可饒恕的罪惡。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;一路上很順利，但一個多小時後還是有人認出了羅輯，於是車裏的人一致要求他下車。羅輯爭辯説自己已經輸入信用點買了票，當然有權坐車。有一個頭發花白的老者拿出兩枚現 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;在已經很不常見的現金硬幣扔給了他，他還是被趕下了車。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「面壁者，你背把鐵鍬幹什麼？」車開時有人從車窗探出頭問。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「為自己挖墓。」羅輯説，引起了車裏的一陣鬨笑。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;面壁者、民粹主義者、委內瑞拉總統雷迪亞茲，在結束面壁回到祖國時，被知道他試圖用同歸於盡方式對抗三體的民眾亂石砸死：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;雷迪亞茲高舉雙手，含着熱淚對着擁向他的人潮深情地呼喚道：「啊，我的人民！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;他的人民扔來的第一塊石頭打在他高舉的左手上，第二塊石頭擊中了他的前胸，第三塊砸在前額上並擊倒了他。隨後，人民的石頭像雨點般飛來，最後幾乎埋住了他那早已沒有生命的軀體。砸向面壁者雷迪亞茲的最後一塊石頭是一位老太太扔的，她吃力地舉着一塊石頭一直走到雷迪亞茲的屍體前，用西班牙語説：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「惡人，你要殺所有的人，那裏面可是有我的孫子，你竟想殺我的孫子！」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;説着，她用盡力氣，顫巍巍地把手中的石頭砸到雷迪亞茲從石堆中露出的已經破碎的頭顱上。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;還有一些細節，也能看出劉慈欣對大眾的鄙視態度，例如在申玉菲丈夫魏成口述自己一些經歷時夾雜的這段話：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;對來這裏的遊客和香客都沒什麼好印象，那些遊客根本不知道是來看什麼的，只是東跑西竄地照相；而那些香客，看上去普遍比遊客窮得多，都處於一種麻木的智力抑制狀態。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;最具諷刺意味的，莫過於下面這段描述人類在星際艦隊毀滅後悲觀絕望，所以十萬人聚集在一起進行裸體性派對的情景：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;整個廣場上白花花的一片，那些白色的顆粒蠕動着，像一鍋煮着的大米粥。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「那都是人嗎？」羅輯疑惑地問。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「裸體的人，這是超級性派對，現在人數已過十萬，還在增加。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;當然，劉慈欣也在本書中描繪了一些平民大眾人性的善良與大愛。例如在描寫太陽系二維化時有這麼一段：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在飛船 A.I.拉出的一個放大畫面上，可以看到一對情侶擁抱着跌入平面，二維化後的兩個人體在平面上並行排列，仍能看出擁抱的樣子，但姿態很奇怪，像一個不懂透視原理的孩童笨拙地畫出來的。還有一位母親，高舉着自己還是嬰兒的孩子跌入平面，那孩子也只比她在三維世界多活了 0.1 秒，他們的形體也生動地印在這幅巨畫上。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;但是這樣的描繪鳳毛麟角（這都有些誇大了，似乎很正面描繪大眾的只有上面這一段），絕大多數關於平民的描繪都是貶斥性質的。而且要注意到，劉慈欣對大眾的讚譽僅僅指其對家庭成員的愛，而非公共領域的利他、為公。這雖然是陳述某種事實，但也可以反映出劉慈欣的保守主義思想和立場（重視傳統家庭、輕忽公共領域，是保守主義的典型特徵）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣對大眾的描述，很符合《烏合之眾》等批判大眾（或者説「羣眾」）劣性的那些學術分析所説的那樣。其他也有不少文學藝術作品表現大眾的劣性，不過很少有像劉慈欣描述的這樣生動、惡辣。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;劉慈欣的這些描述，確實是當今世界很多地方大眾的真實一面。而在中國，大眾的這種劣性更為普遍突出。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，與前面各種描述一樣，劉慈欣在陳述事實的同時，並不是一種悲天憫人的態度，而是純粹的冷嘲熱諷。劉慈欣對大眾的理解，不是那種深刻的同情式理解，而是嘲諷式理解。這與魯迅那種強烈批判國民劣性，但是充滿「哀其不幸，怒其不爭」的悲憤同情之心、善意的出發點和落腳點，性質和導向是完全不同的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;還有重要的一點，劉慈欣所描繪的是未來的世界，且其設定的場景尤其「大低谷」時代後的人類世界，很多時候是非常發達的，人民也是善良和有素質的。那麼這樣的社會，是應該出現類似於現在西方發達國家那種公民社會的，民眾也有一定的參政素質。但劉慈欣並沒有描述任何有公民素質的大眾，也沒有描寫公民社會（只有極少數提到類似的東西，例如市民對議員扔西紅柿，還是貶抑）。相反，《三體》中卻有很多英雄人物。當然，這同樣可以以嚴苛的言論審查環境嚴酷來辯解。可是，根據劉慈欣在本書中及其他場合的價值取向，根本上是「非不能也，是不為也」。即便沒有嚴苛的言論審查，他同樣不會寫公民社會，或者説不會寫公民社會的「好」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（十二）社會達爾文主義的恢宏史詩&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;相對於粉飾獨裁者、性別偏見、鄙視大眾等屬於劉慈欣思想「枝葉」的東西，其社達主義價值才更是劉慈欣及《三體》的「軀幹」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;關於劉慈欣在《三體》中表達的社會達爾文主義傾向，並不需要我再列舉新的例子，前文中那麼多分析和舉例，幾乎處處都有社會達爾文主義色彩。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;所謂「社會達爾文主義」，核心就是「弱肉強食、適者生存」。這八個字也是自然界進化論的核心，社達則是將此從自然界搬到了人類社會之中。這八個字看起來簡單，卻可以包羅萬象。關於社會達爾文主義的具體內容和表現，有許多分析研究，我在此就不搬運了，直接針對劉慈欣的《三體》及劉本人進行分析。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;小説的三要素是人物、環境和故事情節，可以説這三要素就等於小説的全部內容。而劉慈欣的《三體》，其人物、環境、故事情節，都充斥着社會達爾文主義。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;維德、史強、章北海，就是依靠不擇手段，達成其重要的目的。而且，是必須使用在文明社會評價體系下不應該乃至堅決反對的方式，才能達成其重要目的，拯救人類。維德是典型的社會達爾文主義者，而另外兩人不算完全的社達主義者，但是有時會表現出社達主義的思想傾向和行動。而程心，則是他們的反面。程心的思想和所作所為，都很合乎文明環境下的道德準則和法律要求，甚至還非常有愛心、特別善良、高風亮節，可這些德行卻正是其失敗、最終導致絕大多數人類滅亡的關鍵。借用一句詩就是「卑鄙是卑鄙者的通行證、高尚是高尚者的墓誌銘」。這些當然是社會達爾文主義的特徵和表現。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而文中對於環境背景的設計和描述，同樣令人感知社會達爾文主義的凸出。「黑暗森林」理論及現實，就是社達色彩最為凸出之處。此外，諸如文革的背景和葉文潔的遭遇、人類與三體較量的過程、「烏合之眾」即各種大眾式人物在文中的表現，都在反映這個社會的殘酷與黑暗，強權、惡人、心狠手辣、謊言與背信、欺軟怕硬欺善怕惡……無不是在告訴讀者，社會達爾文主義才是社會法則的基礎和主流，也只有適應這種生存法則才能勝出或起碼存活，拒絕甚至對抗社達規則，那不僅無法生存，死的連渣都不剩。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;不僅從小説基本要素看，《三體》的社會達爾文主義無處不在。按情節先後的時間和敍述順序，社達主義也貫穿了整個小説故事的始終（雖然小説的開篇部分和回憶葉文潔經歷的文革部分極少涉及三體世界，但這些人類的爾虞我詐都為後麪人與三體世界鬥爭起了引子、做了鋪墊）。人類與三體世界鬥爭的過程，跌宕起伏的成敗得失，都與社會達爾文主義的思想和行為有關。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;人類和三體的交手過程簡化後是這樣：人類社會自身的不公正與迫害，催生出了葉文潔這樣的反叛者。而另外的一些反叛者卻是因為生活太過優越、道德感正義感太強而加入反叛邪惡人類的大軍。人類反叛者引來三體世界入侵後，地球為對抗危機陷入大低谷。但大低谷之後人們痛定思痛「給歲月以文明」，實現復甦。但復甦後人類喪失了警惕性與危機感。同時，三體世界在得知人類思維的不透明後，學會了欺騙，成功的讓人們麻醉在和平的幻夢中，然後在星際戰役中一舉擊敗了人類。而人類通過建立黑暗森林威懾體系，又從絕境中復甦。但復甦後「故態復萌」，再次因為強調道德和「人權（這裏‘人權’也包括其他星球生命權）」而放鬆警惕、變得柔弱和不設防，選擇了程心這種「聖母」做「執劍人」。然後人類因此再一次幾乎落敗。可獲勝的代價則是讓地球和三體世界都暴露在宇宙的黑暗森林打擊目標中。而人類再次因為強調道德和「人權」喪失了逃脫黑暗森林打擊的機會，最終除極少數人之外都走入死亡。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;顯然，這一切體現了社會達爾文主義的社會現實及社達思想在現實層面的勝利。被道德和法律禁錮就會失敗，順應人性乃至宇宙惡的一面就能生存。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;一部小説的思想意識，很大程度（甚至是完全）就是作者本人自己的思想意識。《三體》濃厚的社會達爾文主義思想，大抵也是其本人所贊成和擁有的。而且，劉慈欣的作品中，並不是隻有《三體》這一部如此。在劉慈欣另一部作品《球狀閃電》中，同樣有明顯的社會達爾文主義氣息。例如女主角林雲就是通過同歸於盡式的方式，逼迫敵人放棄入侵，讓自己國家贏得了戰爭勝利（或者説從失敗邊緣挽回危機，實現停戰）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;《球狀閃電》中，還有更加露骨的社達主義傾向的內容。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「是啊，爸爸，當時聽完我的話，您默默地看了我好一會兒，然後從公文包中拿出兩張照片，兩張一模一樣的照片，只是有一張的一角燒焦了，另一張上面有些褐色的痕跡，後來知道那是血跡。照片上是一個三口之家，父母都是軍官，但他們的軍裝與爸爸的很不一樣，戴着當時爸爸還沒有的肩章，那女孩兒歲數和我差不多，是個很漂亮的小孩兒，皮膚白裏透紅，像個細瓷似的，在北方生長的我從來沒見過那麼好的皮膚，她的頭髮那麼黑那麼長，一直拖到腰間，好可愛的。她的媽媽也很漂亮，爸爸十分英俊，真是讓我羨慕的一家人。可您告訴我，這是兩個敵軍軍官，都在我們的炮擊中陣亡了，打掃戰場時分別從兩具屍體上找到這兩張相同的照片，現在，中間的那個可愛的小女孩兒沒有媽媽，也沒有爸爸了。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;將軍説：「我還對你説，那些殺死你媽媽的敵人並不是壞人，他們那麼做因為他們是軍人，必須儘自己的職責，就像爸爸是軍人，也要在戰場上盡職責去殺死敵人一樣。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;南疆戰場上，我的一個戰友被它的尾巴舔了一下，結果他身上的皮一碰就掉下來，活着還真他媽不如死了，就在野戰醫院，他趁人不注意用手槍自我了結了。當時我就想到最後在醫院見到的媽媽，她全身的皮膚也都潰爛了，她的手指腫脹發黑，連用手槍自我了斷都不可能……這經歷可能會使一些人一生遠離武器，卻也會使另一些人迷上它，我屬於後者，恐怖的機器潛藏着一種力量，正是這種力量像毒品一樣迷住了我。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;……&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「雲啊，我們兩個女人，為了理想和信仰，為了祖國，走上了這條本不該女人走的人跡罕至的路，在這路上我走得比你長，所以對它的兇險知道得更多一些。自然界中的各種力量，包括人們認為最輕柔最無害的那些力量，都可能變成毀滅生命的武器，而這些武器中有一些之殘酷之恐怖，你不親眼看到是無法想象的。但我，一個你認為像你媽媽的女人還是要告訴你，我們的路沒有錯，我對自己的一生無怨無悔，希望你到我這個年紀時也能這樣。孩子，我已搬到一個你不知道的地方，以後也不會再和你聯繫了，在告別之前，我不送你空洞的祝福，祝福對一個軍人來説毫無意義，我只給你一個警告：那些可怕的東西，可能有一天會落到你的同胞和親人的頭上，落到你懷中嬰兒嬌嫩的肌膚上，而防止這事發生的最好辦法，就是搶在敵人或潛在的敵人前面把它造出來！孩子，這就是我所能給你的祝福了。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;這些文字究竟在傳達什麼信息，不同的人出於不同的價值觀和利益，會有不同的詮釋。但是，説其具有社達色彩是完全站得住腳的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;需要補充一下，最具震撼性的社達詞句是這個：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;「斬盡殺絕，這是對一個文明最高的重視。」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;除了書中的東西，劉慈欣還在現實中有所表現。前面已經提到他在和一位學者辯論「為延續人類文明要不要吃人」的話題時，傾向於為達成人類延續的目的不惜吃人的「不擇手段」立場。此外，他在接受一些採訪時，也表達過一些傾向，例如贊同新疆「再教育營」政策。當然，他也表現出過一些中性的態度。例如在接受一位媒體人李佳佳採訪時，其評論事情就沒有明顯的情緒，而是溫和理性，説的也頗務實中立。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;正如我開篇所説，我當然沒能力透視般看到劉慈欣腦子裏邊究竟在想什麼，一切只是根據情理的推測。我評價其為社會達爾文主義者或者社達主義的支持者，我認為還是符合事實的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;回到《三體》，這部書可以説充分體現了社會達爾文主義的種種特徵和表現，最重要的是，書中對於社達主義或者説「弱肉強食、不擇手段」是傾向於支持同情而非批判反對的。這也是其與其他反映人性黑暗、社會醜惡的作品所不同的。這又是前面已經談過的了，但是確實還是有必要再説一次。所以，綜合《三體》的內容廣度深度、思想傾向、暗示主張、現實影響，足可稱其為「社會達爾文主義的恢宏史詩」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;其實，之所以認為《三體》是社會達爾文主義思想，很大程度在於它的讀者中有很大比例是社會達爾文主義者，他們崇拜黑暗森林法則，對託馬斯維德、史強、章北海等人十分佩服，推崇書中「失去獸性，失去一切」的思想，進而對《三體》全書強烈推崇、對劉慈欣高度崇拜。。正是這些人的理解與解讀，讓本書原本就有的社會達爾文主義色彩更加濃厚。這也正是我要説的，《三體》的火熱不僅在於書中內容本身的吸引力，還在於其與現實中國人的價值觀相輝映，昭示着 21 世紀中國高知羣體社會達爾文化的客觀現實。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;值得注意的是，2019 年底至今中國爆發新冠疫情後，經濟形勢急劇惡化，除極少數人外絕大多數人生活普遍艱難。這給了社會達爾文主義者一記重擊，讓他們發現「有本事」、「奮鬥」仍然不能得到收穫。這導致社達主義有所衰落，而又刺激了中國青年毛派的崛起。但是如今中國青年毛派仍然具有強烈的社達情結。巧合的但某種程度也必然的，劉慈欣的《三體》不僅迎合了社達主義者，也迎合了青年毛派，所以《三體》在疫情爆發的當下依舊火熱。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;（十三）「是什麼」之後「怎麼辦」？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;顯然，我已經將一些問題重複的敍述、分析了。所以在綜述部分，我也就不再重新列舉內容，而是根據前面已寫內容為基礎評論分析。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;綜合我在以上具體敍述分析中強調的重點，我對於劉慈欣所説的各種黑暗醜陋的現實存在是承認的；而在這樣現實的成因和責任問題上，我和劉慈欣的觀點有分歧；但在如何對待這樣現實的問題上有根本不同（哪怕有些非質的層面恰恰完全一致）。也就是説，「是什麼」上我和劉慈欣觀點某種程度很相近，在「為什麼」上有重大分歧，在「怎麼辦」上的選擇有質的不同。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;借用幾句俗語諺語名言來概括「是什麼」，就是「君子鬥不過小人」、「卑鄙是卑鄙者的通行證，高尚是高尚者的墓誌銘」、「你在凝視深淵時（與惡結怨，交鋒），深淵也在凝視着你（可能在反抗中變成一樣惡的人，反之可稱為‘寬順者’）」、「好人不長壽，壞人萬萬年」……那麼，我們到底要做「君子」、「高尚者」、「寬順者」、「好人」，還是去做「小人」、「卑鄙者」、「惡人」、「壞人」？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;如果在這樣的簡單條件下，人們還可能有許多選擇前者的，那麼再逐次增添條件，即失敗者者重要利益受損/很在乎的東西被損害呢？嚴重受損/很在乎的東西嚴重受損呢？自身無法生存呢？國破家亡、重於生命的東西也會被以殘酷方式毀滅呢？還選擇前者嗎？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;如果再增加條件，好人未必完全好，壞人未必完全壞；好事未必全是利，壞事未必全是弊。選擇做「小人」那一串有了更多冠冕堂皇的辯解理由，那又如何選擇？然後還能增加許多加大或「減輕」選擇難度（「減輕」選擇難度未必是真的「減輕」）的條件，然後又如何選擇？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;這類討論並不鮮見，尤其在進入現代社會後、思想自由的發達民主國家。但這些討論並沒有一個確定的共識。而中國這樣的國家則鮮少類似討論，但是現實中卻不斷的上演着這樣的選擇（雖然未必像所述那些諺語所説的善惡正誤那麼分明），至於選了什麼應該眾所周知。當然也不止中國，全人類每個國家每個人都會面臨這些選擇。而劉慈欣的《三體》，則是將這樣的問題更加深刻和尖鋭的提了出來。維德的話「失去人性，失去很多；失去獸性，失去一切」，則是劉慈欣針對問題給出的濃縮版答案。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;現實的選擇當然更加複雜，可是總是有相對的正邪與勝負、善惡與興衰。我們在很多時候，尤其攸關個體、家庭、社羣、國家、人類命運的時候，往往必須要選擇。我們每個人人生都可能會參與這種選擇甚至參與許多次這樣的選擇。或許我們不需要喪心病狂，並不是每一次都選擇為生存而變得邪惡，可終究不會幹乾淨淨。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;（因 matters 字數所限，最後一章（關於劉慈欣」，在評論區補充）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h2&gt;微故事: 窮人的選擇 (東加豆)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/5ed90da1-e96c-449e-96ed-b23201a9dfe9.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韋跟著一個陌生人去了一個陌生的地方，那裡一片白茫茫，純淨和美好，空中有白色的雲朵在漂浮，陽光穿透雲層，灑下金黃色的光芒，一切彷彿是天堂一樣，陌生人就像使者。李韋心中帶著好奇和喜悅，因為這些都只有在夢境或電影才會遇見的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;後來，李韋知道自己死了，陌生地方真的一個天堂，而陌生人真是一個使者。使者告訴他，因為醫療失誤，所以他的死了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;是這樣的，醫務人員將一名癌症病人的檔案錯放進李韋的檔案中，當李韋知道自己得了癌症後，心靈晴天霹靂，他無法承受突如其來的事實，三天後就心臟病發死了。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這種醫療失誤簡直是混賬! 李韋心中的驚慌和痛苦，一時無法用言語來形容，人生實在太可笑，他的生命就這樣被誤摧毀！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，上天總喜歡與人開玩笑，問題是會接二連三，不知道李韋是福還是禍，人有人的犯錯，使者也會犯錯。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;是這樣的，使者把一名時辰到快要死的人，錯誤放入了李韋的生死冊中，事實，李韋還未到期死的，可是，當使者試圖將李韋的靈魂送回他的身體時，李韋的遺體已經被火化成了灰燼。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這時，使者為自己的失誤而抱歉，迫不得已給李韋一個大特賣，並告訴李韋，他可以選擇任何一個即將要死的人，延續他的生命，以後，李韋將會成為那個人了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韋聽到使者的説話，心情猶如翻江倒海，既驚喜又忐忑不安，這是難以想象人生的轉變。李韋想到自己窮一生，黴一世，他竟然得到重新選擇自己的身份的機會，這就像得到寶物沒兩樣。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;他腦海中不斷閃現過去的經歷，和夢想的畫面。比如看著銀行帳戶餘額是就懊惱，在公家醫院輪候十小時的可悲，在公眾場合從不會成為別人的焦點等等。李韋內心越來越興奮，他急不及待地想要開始新的生活，擺脫過去的日子，他開始思考該選擇誰。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;如果當一名醫生，他守護人生命的力量，救死扶傷，使病人恢復健康，擺脫痛苦，讓人帶有希望！這種專業造福人羣，對世界非常有貢獻，如此德高望重。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韋醫生！噢...太讓人興奮了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;律師也不錯。律師在社會扮演正義與秩序的重要維護者。 律師能夠解決紛爭，保護公民權益，促進法制建設。這種專業有高度的智維和挑戰性，律師可以拯救世人，對世界非常有貢獻，律師也有強烈的成就感和使命感。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韋大律師！哦...叫人激動了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;如果當政客呢？政客和人民是息息相關的，是不可分割。因為政客可以通過政策的制定，影響社會的發展方向，讓人民享受生活美好的氛圍，安居樂業，家庭和睦。這種專業絕對是實現個人抱負和理想，對社會有高度的影響力，是非常有成就感的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韋首長官！哇...真叫人心跳加速！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛學者｝也不錯，醉心學術研究，追求真理，擴展人類的知識邊界。沉浸在理論研究與實踐的探索。學者代表了某一種權威，是培養下一代，也是引領者，專業是學者的魅力所在，其持續學習與分享知識的精神滿足。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;｛建築師｝有貢獻，｛會計師｝有貢獻，｛藝術家｝也有貢獻。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;藝術家啊！繪畫、雕塑、音樂、舞蹈等，傳達了人性的複雜情感與生活的美態。藝術家享受探索、創新和突破界限，作品更可能影響深遠，觸動人心，充滿激情與靈感，滿足了人的追求、解放和精神需要！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韋...大藝術家！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;使者找了幾個將要死的人，李韋馬上指著那名醫生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;可是，當使者的手輕輕觸摸著水晶球時，他看到了李韋的過去，使者帶著可惜的語氣説道：｛你不能上他的身！因為你曾經斥罵他們！｝&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韋卻不明白，他從未見過這個人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;使者清楚地説，因為李韋斥罵醫生，他幾乎每次見完醫生之後就會斥罵他們！即使在電視上看到不認識的醫生就會大罵一頓。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;比如：這醫生沒有醫德！他只不過是追求名利和地位，只是以此來證明自己的價值。濫用醫療資源、忽視病人權益、濫藥、做不必要手術！垃圾！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韋説過每一句説話，都在水晶球再次浮現。李韋感到無地自容，尷尬非常。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;使者馬上安慰他，不必難過，幾乎每個人都是這樣的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韋心裡著急，時間一秒一秒地過去，使者卻安然淡定，始終每一秒鐘有千千萬萬正在會死去的人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韋馬上指著一名快要死的律師。年輕有為，在法律界的天空中漸漸升起，突如其來一場車禍，這樣死去未免太可惜了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;可是，當使者的手觸摸著水晶球時，他看到了李韋生前説過一些話，使者可惜地説道：｛你不能上他的身！因為你曾經斥罵他們！｝然後，水晶球發光了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛他們只是利用法律漏洞，獲取利益而犧牲弱者的權益，甚至與犯罪集團勾結，違反職業道德，洩漏委託人的隱私或商業機密。法律只是幫有錢人辦事的，見錢眼開！人渣！｝&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這些話都是李韋不只説過一次，是超過一百次，只要有媒體出現任何律師，他都會不停地指著他們斥罵，直到他心情靜下來。那麼，這意味著他不能找任何律師的身體，李韋心中已經冒汗了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;政客、建築師、會計師、學者等，李韋通通都罵過了，尤其是政客，李韋天天都在罵，在報紙上罵，在電視上罵，甚至在街上看到那些選舉海報，他更斥罵連連。｛貪腐、濫用權力、忽視民生、玩弄權術、踐踏制度、破壞社會進步，下流！）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韋已經心中有數了，他不會再尋找這些專業人士的身體了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，儘管喜歡看電影，聽音樂，看錶演，哪些藝人沒有被他斥罵過？畫家、音樂家、舞蹈家、電影明星等等。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;（這個人只不過是虛有其表的。虛偽的、整容的、作狀的、假的、醜聞、抄襲的、沒有實力的...）總之，李韋就是喜歡看到他們的負面消息，而且深信不疑，更會四處宣揚。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;雖然，世界在每一秒鐘都有千千萬萬人將會死去，可是李韋的時間並不多，似乎使者又弄錯了，李韋只剩下五分鐘時間。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;使者對著水晶球發力。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;終於，他發現，有一種人，李韋從未罵過的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;李韋，從不罵｛窮人！｝&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;最後，他在一個｛窮人｝的身體，上他身了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;完!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;寫作日期：2024 年 3 月 22 日&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;開始時間 : 11:00am&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;完成時間 : 16:22pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;圖.文. 東加豆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;我除了寫微故事，還製作有聲書，希望我們能互相認識。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;喜歡我的文章嗎？盼得到您的支持、點讚，或分享我的文章，讓我知道創作的路上有你陪伴。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E8%88%87%E9%BC%93%E5%8B%B5/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/支持與鼓勵/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;關於我：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;故事選集&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://matters.town/@tonkabean/collections&quot;&gt;https://matters.town/@tonkabean/collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFT 收集&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://liker.land/zh-Hant/like1cdavnkhzj8wsaeafmyqctrs9952q4hgk6tpael?tab=created&quot;&gt;https://liker.land/zh-Hant/like1cdavnkhzj8wsaeafmyqctrs9952q4hgk6tpael?tab=created&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;東加豆貼文生活 What&#39;s App Channel~~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;你的追蹤, 就是我的動力.

            <title>「唯一不可原諒的罪是刻意的殘忍」</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;最近看了一部美劇，《宿敵》第二季（Feud: Capote vs. The Swans Season 2）。描寫作家卡波特與紐約上流社會貴婦之間的恩怨。卡波特不僅文筆好，而且極為洞悉人心，能説會道。在貴婦們需要安慰時體貼入微，為她們排憂解惑；八卦起來又毒舌刻薄，舌綻蓮花；俏皮、冷血和小丑般的做作。他因此很討上流社會空虛的貴婦的歡心，成為她們的寵物、知心大姐和情感依靠。按現在巧偽的説法，能提供極大的「情緒價值」。在他的攻勢面前，她們毫無招架，紛紛向他毫無保留地敞開心扉，與他分享自己的祕密。他還是同性戀，貴婦們的老公也很放心，樂得他陪伴自己的妻子，省去不少煩心事。他因此在上流社會社交圈如魚得水，成為大紅人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/c4381e0e-8c34-4960-9f80-868882dc9a9f.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;卡波特確實對這些空虛的貴婦有驚人的洞見，他稱這些貴婦為天鵝，向他的相好揭示出她們的本質，她們「在水面上美麗而嫺靜，動人、獨一無二、滑過社會的池塘/但是上帝給了她們太多的包袱，你看，在清澈的水面下，她們必須加倍有力地划水才能像一隻普通的鴨子一樣漂浮着/這是一個只有一些人能承受的巨大負擔/你知道，有些天鵝會因為美麗的外表以及它們表面奇異的羽毛的重量而淹死」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/1ab7fa7a-31b3-4fad-b3c6-d951468c97a0.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;但他也是利用這些貴婦。為了金錢或者為了表現自己不世的才華，將這些貴婦家中的醜聞寫成故事公開發表，名字都沒改。從而與貴婦圈子反目成仇，被逐出了上流社會社交圈。她們痛罵他是「宮廷基佬小丑」。但在相互的傷害中，又都挺懷念過去的美好時光。離不開對方，對對方有極大的依戀和不捨，分離對雙方都是折磨。卡波特不斷乞求回到她們身邊；貴婦們一邊想念他，又不肯原諒他。就這樣相愛相殺。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;其中有個貴婦痛斥卡波特背信棄義的話，特別精闢，「唯一不可原諒的罪是刻意的殘忍」，而這本來是貴婦引自卡波特的一本小説。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/e48b3a71-c4d2-42fd-9283-da103c50208e.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;這讓我想起了最近發生的一起惡性案件。河北省邯鄲市三名初中生殘忍殺害同學的案件，披露出的暴行令人髮指，頭皮發麻。三名罪犯的暴行完完全全是「刻意的殘忍」，不止謀財害命。他們是如此的冷血、麻木；把自己的快樂建立在他人的痛苦之上，以吞噬他人的痛苦來獲得快感。他們反社會、反人類，對生命有一種本能的仇視，以扼殺生命為快樂。根本上，他們仇視自己的生命，對自己來到這個世上充滿了怨恨。因而想毀滅他人，毀滅自己。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;那麼這種怨恨從何而來，是殘酷的環境帶來的？在他們短短的人生中，從來沒有得到過溫暖和愛意，還是天生如此？這是一個極其深奧的問題，我以為兩方面因素都存在。但無論如何，這是不可原諒、不可饒恕的罪行。因為他們的罪行是「刻意的殘忍」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2024 年 3 月 22 日&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>論語漫讀（37）：是亦為政 — 廣義的政治與狹義的政治</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.red-publish.com/book/2990&quot;&gt;電子書：《論語漫讀》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;或謂孔子曰：「子奚不為政？」子曰：「《書》雲：‘孝乎惟孝，友于兄弟，施於有政’。是亦為政，奚其為為政？」 &lt;/strong&gt;（為政第二）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f4d8dc70-a36d-47e5-8c2d-30b31f03ce9e.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;孔子天天給學生講當官施政的學問。就有人感到奇怪，或者暗地擠兌孔子，問孔子，「你怎麼不去從政呢？」言下之意是，你行你上呀！這個得看具體的情景。到底是哪種情況，不得而知。不過，這話問得沒道理。許多情況下，説和做是兩回事，會説不見得會做，會做不見得會説。比如説足球教練員，能教球員怎麼踢球，但並一定他上場就踢得好。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這個對話肯定發生在孔子當官之前。孔子一直是很想從政的，但一直沒有機會。或者是諸侯大夫沒看上他，或者是他覺得與當政者不投緣。於是就搪塞道：「《尚書》上説，‘孝就是孝敬父母，友則施於兄弟。施行孝和友就是政事’。這就是為政，又要怎樣才能算是為政呢？」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這裏，孔子明顯偷換概念，將狹義的政治換成了廣義的政治。但現代政治理論確實也認為，廣義的政治就是處理一切人與人的關係，特別是權力關係，誰控制誰？誰聽從誰？如何做出決策等。例如現在人們所説的「辦公室政治」，就屬於廣義政治。極端的情況，家庭內部也存在政治，特別是過去男人可以納妾的舊式家庭。宮鬥劇就可以看成是家庭政治的演繹。大的家族內部政治關係更復雜，如《紅樓夢》。但狹義的政治僅指公共領域內的權力關係，特指政府或政權的權力關係與運用。問者是問為何孔子不去為諸侯為國家辦事，而孔子卻用更一般性政治含義來敷衍。説我管教學生、孝敬父母，友愛兄弟，使喚妻子僕人，善待鄉裏，這些也是為政。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;再者，儒家本來就不分私域和公域，將家事等同於國事。家庭內部關係與國家內部關係等同，「君君臣臣，父父子子」，所謂「家國同構」。國家國家，國即是家，家即是國。因之，家事和國事之間也沒有明確的分野，「齊家治國平天下」，於儒家而言，是順理成章的邏輯延伸。「齊家」則能「治國」，「治國」則能「平天下」。反過來説，「齊家」是為「治國」打基礎，「治國」是為「平天下」打基礎。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;所以，孔子這麼回答，雖然不實誠，但理由還是很充足的。&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>澳門療癒空間（一）：以香朝心，心可治？｜投稿 #30</title>
            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;作者：瘋狂的澳女&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;如今這世界，是非對錯、真假虛實愈發難辨。尤其邁入新工業革命，真真假假的虛實世界又流露了多少真情。我總在想，人到底有何求？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;寫完兩篇&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://matters.town/@macaology16/373790&quot;&gt;死亡空間系列&lt;/a&gt;，我的腦海裏不斷出現我所遇見心正在受苦的人。我不停思索除了「被醫治」的苦，難道我們無法尋求一種舒適的療癒方式嗎？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因此，是次我想跟大家談如何用芳療自我療癒。相信大家都明白，精神病在傳統觀念中是一種禁忌。正如呀馬所説，去精神科治療是極其需要勇氣及支持。如是，我們有第二條路可選嗎？或許今天我們所談的香薰治療會是其中一種。而認識這一種治療方式源自筆者的一次偶遇。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;第一次遇見 Anna 時，她正耐心為客人講解香味。不知為何，在門外看著她溫婉面孔的我，那一刻深深地吸引著我。當我步入門內，空氣中不斷有香氣環繞著我。凝視著眼前的人，她好像異常有耐心（事後足足訪問了她三小時）。看著店牌上寫著心療香水，大大地引起了我的好奇。原來 Anna 是一名&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;香味可以引起人的本質及其自身經歷&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna 説道，香味其實就好像是人的一個記錄，每一個人書寫的方式、目的皆不同。有的人會追求一種已經得不到的香味而選擇複製它，可能與過往有關，冀求透過香味去延續回憶。也有人會透過香味去尋找自己，從而得到一個答案。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因此，大家想要的不一定是結果而是一個過程。在香薰治療過程中，我們會通過一問一答的方式去摸索香味，令其自身更清楚明白自己正處於人生的哪一個階段，而香味只是一個載體去記錄自己找尋想得到的信息。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;此外，有一些人會透過香味去改變自己。比如平時是比較內斂的，便希望透過香味令自己主動及開朗一點。因此，有些人用香是希望改變自身行為或者是想法及情緒，再深入的話就是改變性格。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;心療香水治療過程：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step1 芳療師詢問基本的身體狀況&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step2 芳療師選擇香味給治療者訪香&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step3 治療者對香味進行聯想並與芳療師交流&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step4 治療者對所試香味評分&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;（重複以上試香，直至芳療師停止）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step5 芳療師針對治療者所評分的香型進行講解&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step6 芳療師針對治療者喜歡的香型進行交流並調配香水&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;在澳門做心療香水已經 2 年，見證很多朋友仔的改變。比如有人第一次做心療香水時所調製的香型就揭露了他正在經歷的事情。但是，當他已經走出來，再一次去試香的時候就會發現，他所選擇的香與最初的選擇是完全不同的香味體系。因此，調配出來的香水就會成為一個很具體的載體去告訴你，原來你已經改變了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/567b9b4f-69a1-44d0-b6b7-13cc54c72e73.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image: unsplash@soymeraki&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;其實我們喜歡一種味道是會跟你當下心情或過往經歷有關。此外。當你今天完成體驗之後，你喜歡的味道隨時隨地都會再改變。所以，在治療過程中你所選擇的香味僅反映你當刻的情緒及感受，不代表永遠。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;學者發現香薰對記憶有著神奇的連結功能，無論時間過了多久，只要再次遇上特定香氣，便可將您帶到回憶當下，並透過香薰精油內的不同化學份子改變著您的情緒。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;人除了會喜愛香味，也會對香味有偏見&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;我們可能會因為某段快樂的記憶喜愛某種香味，但是在芳療過程中，你會發現你可能會本能地排斥某種香味，其背後原因可能是與自身負面記憶有關。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna 指出，在試香的過程中往往會引發人們並不知道的事情，或是得到某些不曾記起的事情或新信息。排斥香味其實是在提醒你，它所聯繫或代表的某一件事情正影響著你非常深，甚至很久遠，只是你並不知道。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;其中一個主因是，有很多試香者經常以為這是一件小事，卻不知道原來它一直影響著你。因此，在香水心療過程中最重要的是認知自己。包括意識自己選擇的原因、舉動及背後意義。Anna 強調，在香水心療中並不是要解決或改變任何事情，而是幫試香者把內心世界展現出來，從而認知自我。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/77f0d498-fb44-4ab8-bdf3-9335815f7062.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image: unsplash@rishabhdharmani&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna 形容，香味就好像給了你一面鏡子，你照見鏡裏的自己。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;人性的善與惡，在香味之下卻如一&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna 提到，在試香時人往往容易展現出自我的本質。因此筆者好奇一問，在見證人的本質時，會是一個怎樣的感受過程，是否也會看見人的善與惡？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna 回應，作為芳療師反而很慶幸自己有機會作為一個角色去了解每一個人，更加覺得在芳療過程中，反而覺得人其實是一樣的。人的不同只是我們塑造出來的，可能是刻意選擇或者沒有選擇。其實人的感受、開心與不開心其實都非常相似的。因為人的心路歷程是很相似的，不論人的經歷有多豐富或多簡單，其實我們的心都是一樣的，都會因為一些很小的事情有不同的反應。人有高高低低的時候，只是大家高低的原因不同。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;特別是在調香的過程中，試香者想真實地去觀照自己內心的時候，好多事已經不重要了。所以很多時候，芳療師不太會看到人性的一面，反而大家很難得地把重心放在自己的心靈上面，更加關注自己怎麼去面對物質或人性的部分，然後如何去保留初心或健康的狀態。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;芳療師的治療侷限&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;在芳療過程，我們會遇到不同情緒狀態的人。但是，芳療師只會因應治療者的需求作出回應。如果治療者沒有意願説出自已的需求，芳療師不會主動或刻意去介入。因為如果治療者沒有準備好，芳療師多做一步也是太多，更有機會產生不好的影響。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;比如，試香者可能只是一張白紙般來體驗，但你不停挖掘他內心深處的恐懼或負面情緒，而他可能未準備好去接受。如果對方是願意説出來甚至問你應該如何解決的時候，才會進一步去深入交流。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0a1494de-768e-4f43-8ff5-afdaca026f6a.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image: unsplash@artbyhybrid&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;另一種情況是，若遇到完全未有準備的人，我們可能會中止試香。因為試香者的狀態可能不適合調香，又或者即使他調完也未必會喜歡。其主要原因是試香者沒有打開自己或者出現無法辨香的情況，感覺不到香味對自己的感受。若出現這種情況，芳療的心療功能就很有限，那芳療師可能會轉向更目的性的解決方法，比如失眠應該用哪一種香有助入睡。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;芳香療法如何幫助抑鬱症？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;許多精油都具有顯著的抗抑鬱特性，這可能是當今芳香療法最有價值的領域之一。許多幫助抑鬱症的精油也可以緩解壓力，因為許多精油可能由於醏含量而具有平衡作用。精油具有許多特性，不僅可以針對抑鬱症，還可以保持平衡和其他身體或精神問題。－International Federation of Aromatherapists&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;在筆者試香的過程中，Anna 就好像一位魔法佔卜師，不斷向我噴灑魔法香味。有時候她會給我一個世界，在那一個世界裏，我正安靜地躺在大片草地上，懶得像隻海獅般在岸上曬太陽。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;此時，Anna 便會好奇一問，那一個世界是怎樣的？可是，有時候她又會用魔法帶我去一個奇臭無比的空間，令我感到想逃脫，並且不斷觀察我的表情及反應。可過份的是，這位占卜師並不會一直給你喜愛的香味，而是一直送你去你討厭的香味世界，因為她説：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我正在尋找你痛苦的根源⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;（待續）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#文章篇數：2️⃣0️⃣7️⃣&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;👉&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot;

            <title>微故事: 蝦妹的肉餅 (東加豆)</title>
            <description>&lt;h2&gt;微故事: 蝦妹的肉餅 (東加豆)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;在香港某個角落，住著一對頗有雅趣的老夫婦----{魚毛和蝦妹}。{魚毛}雖齡已｛登陸｝，仍熱衷於筆走龍蛇，醉心於書法，他的字體如遊龍戲鳳，充滿靈動之氣。而{蝦妹}則是一道風景線，熱愛跑步與音樂，總是隨著音符的步伐，在晨曦中活力穿過街巷，看著大自然的｛蛋黃｝從山坡升起，對她來説是樂事，蝦妹，她並不介意自己齡已｛入伍｝。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛大鱔｝是魚毛的友人，同樣沉迷書法、陶醉於紙筆墨的世界。不過今天他們沒有以筆會友，沒有在紙端鬥智鬥勇，二人去了海旁釣魚。可是兩小時過去，成績並不理想，魚毛也沒有一條，更不要説大鱔了，最後發現了幾條魷魚，還好，回家有好交待！今晚，大鱔決定去魚毛家聚餐，其妻｛石斑｝也來訪。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;蝦妹知道了四人飯桌非常興奮，她又可以大顯身手了。蝦妹獨特的廚藝是朋友圈中的美食大使，尤其她那一味撚手小菜---｛梅菜蒸肉餅！｝&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;吃過她弄｛梅菜蒸肉餅｝的朋友都忍不住讚嘆連連，蝦妹做出來的梅菜蒸肉餅，口感細膩，肉餅入口即化，梅菜的微酸微鹹帶來的層次感讓人回味無窮。--- 報紙檔雄伯説。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;蝦妹的｛梅菜蒸肉餅｝，不僅外形誘人，而且味道更是令人驚艷。肉餅鬆軟多汁，梅菜的鮮香和肉餅的鮮甜完美結合，讓人忍不住一口接一口。--- 樓下管理員珍姐説。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;蝦妹的｛梅菜蒸肉餅｝每一口都帶來滿滿的幸福感，她的廚藝可謂登峯造極。肉餅的鮮味和梅菜的獨特風味交織在一起，讓人不斷讚嘆，彷彿在享受一場美食盛宴。---藥房超仔説。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛梅菜蒸肉餅｝是蝦妹家的專長，她從不會用碎肉機來製作。人手剁肉能夠保持肉的結構和口感，肉粒大小不一，還能保留一些肉筋和纖維，吃起來更有韌性，還有肉粒間有空隙，更容易釋放肉質的香氣，使肉餅香氣更濃。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一口咬下去，梅菜和肉混合而成的醬汁隨即爆出來，這種味道和口感會讓人愛死的！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;四餸一湯、白飯任裝。蝦妹已經準備好，有魚、有肉、有菜。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;輪到｛梅菜蒸肉餅｝的時候，蝦妹彷彿要上演一場人生大舞台，她知道｛大鱔｝和｛石班｝這對夫妻一定來錄影她，就像採訪記者一樣。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;蝦妹伸出一雙手，左手一把刀、右手一把刀，然後一下就劈下去！不停地劈下劈下、剁下剁下，豬肉和梅菜在她身上成了一種愛恨交織，總之，蝦妹的自律神經感非常良好。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;落鑊的過程是非常考功夫的！水的份量、熱的溫度、時間的恰當，拿出來的｛梅菜蒸肉餅｝果然賣相一流！大家的肚子已經餓得咕咕叫。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/665ff1ff-6139-4a5e-9913-28091d5236ba.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;豆媽小菜&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，此時此刻！就是此刻！蝦妹捧著那碟色香味俱全的｛梅菜蒸肉餅｝，正準備放到客廳的飯桌上。誰知，她在廚房門口不慎踩到一支毛筆，結果跌倒了，手裡的梅菜肉餅隨之摔落，肉餅分散在地上，東一件、西一件，地上的肉餅還有輕微的煙冒起的，熱辣辣！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;地上那支毛筆是魚毛的！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;魚毛臉上沾滿了汗水，三個人感到非常可惜，懷著失望的心情的時候，蝦妹的腦袋已經動著了。她要再做梅菜蒸肉餅，有的是時間，而且明天後天也是假期。蝦妹叫他們三個人自己玩，寫毛筆也好，看新聞也好，她把廚房門關了。大家看見蝦妹在笑，所有問題都不是問題了，遲就遲吧。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;可是，家裡原來已經沒有梅菜了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然後，她的腦袋又在動著，突然，蝦妹想到了魚毛今天釣魚帶回來的｛魷魚｝！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;對，｛魷魚蒸肉餅｝！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;沒有人知道蝦妹在廚房做什麼，但廿五分鐘之後，她打開廚房門，一碟熱辣辣的｛魷魚蒸肉餅｝就誕生了！大家也急不及待站起來看，果然賣相一流，那些魷魚的鮮鹹味溶在肉餅中，傳來一陣陣香噴噴的氣味。大家也豎起了一隻大拇指向蝦妹致敬！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/489af8c7-35e9-4653-a257-e45e7ab362c4.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;豆媽小菜&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，此時此刻！就是此刻！蝦妹正準備把｛魷魚蒸肉餅｝&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;放到客廳的飯桌上。誰知，她在廚房門口，又一再踩到一支毛筆。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;哎！她又跌倒了，手裡的｛魷魚蒸肉餅｝又分散在地上，東一件、西一件，熱辣辣的魷魚蒸肉餅！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;地上，那支毛筆是大鱔的！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;蝦妹説：｛你們三個人自己玩！寫毛筆也好，看新聞也好｝。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;她一手就把廚房門關了，她苦笑著關門！大家看到蝦妹在苦笑，苦笑都是笑！所有問題都不是問題了，遲就遲吧。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;蝦妹的腦袋在動著，可是，可是魷魚也沒有了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;沒有人知道蝦妹在廚房做什麼。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，又過了廿五分鐘，蝦妹打開廚房門，小心翼翼看地上是否有第三支毛筆。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;就是此時此刻！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;蝦妹捧著那碟色香味俱全的肉餅放到客廳的飯桌上。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛鹹蛋蒸肉餅｝！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/cbd259c5-ad1f-48aa-911b-288737224117.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;AI 生成&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;大家！終於有得吃咯！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;正呀！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;備註：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛登陸｝年已六十歲或以上&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛入伍｝年已五十歲或以上&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;特別鳴謝: 豆媽肉餅圖片提供!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;完!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;寫作日期：2024 年 3 月 21 日&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;開始時間 : 10:52am&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;完成時間 : 15:28pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;圖.文. 東加豆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我除了寫微故事，還製作有聲書，希望我們能互相認識。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;喜歡我的文章嗎？盼得到您的支持、點讚，或分享我的文章，讓我知道創作的路上有你陪伴。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E8%88%87%E9%BC%93%E5%8B%B5/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/支持與鼓勵/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;關於我：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;我的故事選集&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://matters.town/@tonkabean/collections&quot;&gt;https://matters.town/@tonkabean/collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;我的 NFT 文章收集箱&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://liker.land/zh-Hant/like1cdavnkhzj8wsaeafmyqctrs9952q4hgk6tpael?tab=created&quot;&gt;https://liker.land/zh-Hant/like1cdavnkhzj8wsaeafmyqctrs9952q4hgk6tpael?tab=created&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>310｜當「娜拉」回鄉，重遇「高更」</title>

Matlin) 和大衞·J.斯唐 (David J Stang) 認為，人對積極事件的記性比對消極事件的記性，而這反過來又意味着，人更可能把自己的行動和信念，建立在對現實的過度積極的感知的基礎之上。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;「波麗安娜效應」和「抑鬱現實主義模型」都肯定了同一個核心哲學觀念，那就是，除非我們在臨牀上抑鬱了，否則我們傾向於把現實理解得比實際情況更積極。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因此，抑鬱不再（或至少不只）是一種使（行動）無效的情緒障礙，它也是一扇門，通過它，我們得以窺見「現實本身」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在 20 世紀八、九十年代，這些想法依然在很大程度上停留在臨牀實驗心理學領域。但在新世紀，隨着哲學上的悲觀主義開始顯得好像是面對我們艱難時代的挑戰的有效方式，這些想法又開始重新出現並逐漸脫離了起初的學術語境，被應用到像政治和文學那樣的多樣的領域。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;舉幾個例子來説。人們會聯繫法國作家米歇爾·韋勒貝克的作品（它描述了社會和性達爾文主義的壓抑現實）和克里斯汀·斯摩伍德的處女作《心智生活》（用賈·託倫迪諾的話來説，它描述了「我們想的和我們實際上做的之間的深淵」）來討論抑鬱現實主義。雖然沒有直接提到抑鬱現實主義，但託馬斯·利戈蒂的《反人類陰謀》顯然也共享抑鬱現實主義假設的核心觀念。利戈蒂很可能是我們時代最有影響力的恐怖作家，他筆下古怪、機械的世界源自於抑鬱視角看生活的「思想的零度」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我不否認，那種認為抑鬱是一種看待現實的優勢視角，認為抑鬱能夠以更清晰、更「客觀」的方式來看現實的想法，在當時——差不多就在我對哲學上的悲觀主義萌生興趣的時候——的我看來頗具吸引力。而且，在某種意義上説，我依然為之所吸引：我們有充分的理由認為，悲觀主義是一種理解當下、並在智識和政治上對之做出行動的有效工具。可這些年來，我越來越相信，在這種被泛化的抑鬱現實主義觀念中，隱藏着可能帶來危險的潛台詞。換言之，抑鬱現實主義也是一種意識形態建構。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我發現這點很重要：抑鬱現實主義和波麗安娜效應假設都是 20 世紀 70 年代末在美國——也就是説，在新自由主義資本主義誕生的同一個時間、同一個地點——出現的。在英國，最早把新自由主義經濟和「現實主義」觀念關聯起來的，正是瑪格麗特·撒切爾。眾所周知，撒切爾説，資本主義之外「別無選擇」，也就是説，「現實主義」的人不會夢想另一個世界，更不會為之而鬥爭。文化批評家馬克·費舍把這種壓抑的社會變革觀恰當地稱作「資本主義現實主義」。費舍一輩子都在和抑鬱鬥爭，並最終於 2017 年輕生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;當然，我的意思不是説，在研究抑鬱者的現實主義的時候，阿洛伊和艾布拉姆森是在制定什麼政治計劃。但當時的時代精神，可能的確影響了她們的研究興趣，或至少，她們的發現助長了二十世紀八九十年代的政治氛圍。儘管如此，撒切爾自我實現的預言還是成為了現實：數十年來，抑鬱一直在增長，並且已經有充分的理由表明，抑鬱人數的增長，至少在一定程度上與資本主義及其後果（如氣候變化）相關。這也正是馬克·費舍一輩子都在論證的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;把抑鬱當作看待世界的「優勢」視角——彷彿抑鬱的人更客觀——可能是危險的，因為它可能會使我們認為，我們必須接受在當下的政治和經濟系統之外「別無選擇」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在我們的哲學工具箱中，悲觀主義可能是一個有用的工具：它有助於我們看到令人不適的真相。在氣候災難和大規模滅絕的時代，作為一種思辨實踐——也就是説，想象我們的行動可能導致的最壞結果並在為時已晚之前對之做出行動——悲觀主義可能是必要的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但「思考可能的世界中最壞的那個」不應妨礙我們「為未來想象一個更好的世界」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;它不應成為阻止社會變革的手段。&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>「普里戈任的進軍」：到底發生了什麼？│「Prigozhin’s March」: What Was It All About?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Posle 編輯部&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 年 6 月 26 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;馬城，譯、日土兀，校&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/3d1d0852-74c4-422d-a228-b949062b4cc6.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2023 年)6 月 23 日至 24 日的事件已經被描述為普京政權面臨的最嚴重的國內政治挑戰。在短短的幾個小時內，瓦格納兵團幾乎沒有遇到抵抗就控制了俄羅斯南部的主要城市頓河畔羅斯托夫和沃羅涅日。瓦格納兵團甚至進入莫斯科外數百公里的地方。瓦格納領導人葉夫根尼·普里戈任宣佈開始軍事叛亂，公開質疑全面入侵烏克蘭的必要性，要求俄羅斯軍事領導層下台，並聲稱他的目標是「正義」。雖然這場衝突在幾乎沒有流血的情況下得到解決，但這似乎永遠破壞了普京對政權穩定及政權內部團結所做出的的承諾。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 毫無疑問，普里戈任是一名戰爭罪犯，也是一個追求個人利益的機會主義者。在叛變前的幾個月裏，普里戈任發表了許多聲明，抨擊俄羅斯軍事領導層試圖控制由前俄羅斯囚犯和退役軍官組成的瓦格納部隊。葉夫根尼·普里戈任的事業得益於普京的庇護，他在國家安全機構中有着廣泛的人脈，他最清楚政府的弱點和普京的「指揮鏈」的脆弱性。在烏克蘭的所謂「特別軍事行動」中扮演關鍵角色的蘇羅維金和阿列克謝耶夫將軍公開呼籲普里戈任「清醒過來」，「和平解決問題」。軍隊中的大多數人對叛軍保持沉默的中立。普里戈任要求會見國防部長謝爾蓋·紹伊古和總參謀長瓦列裏·格拉西莫夫，二人從未對正在發生的事情發表任何評論而且消失了。值得注意的是，瓦格納散發的傳單不僅要求他們辭職，還要求立即對紹伊古和格拉西莫夫進行軍事法庭審判，指控的罪名包括：殘酷對待士兵、軍隊補給不足，以及隱瞞戰爭進程的真相。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 6 月 24 日上午，弗拉基米爾·普京向全國發表了緊急的五分鐘講話。他稱瓦格納的叛亂是對俄羅斯軍隊的背叛，但沒有提到任何粉碎叛亂的具體行動。普京強調了這次兵變在道德和政治層面的影響，稱這是一場需要最嚴肅處理的背叛。他指責叛亂分子將俄羅斯推向內戰和戰爭失敗的邊緣。然而，俄羅斯總統沒有提到任何名字，這表明他準備並不充分，同時對形勢不確定。瓦格納武裝分子的數千人縱隊在不到一天的時間裏穿越了廣闊的領土，在距離莫斯科 200 公里的地方自願停下來。與此同時，據推測，普京總統匆匆離開首都，在偏遠的瓦爾代鄉間住所錄製了他的講話。在兵變爆發僅幾個小時後，地方官員和親克里姆林宮的政客們就在社交媒體上宣誓效忠普京和憲法秩序。可以預見的是，一些政治力量與派系和普通公民沒有響應總統的號召來抵抗叛徒，而是表達了他們對叛亂分子的支持。其中包括前線兩邊的新納粹分子：與烏克蘭武裝部隊並肩作戰的俄羅斯志願軍（Russian Volunteer Corps）和自 2014 年以來作為俄羅斯代理人蔘與與烏克蘭武裝衝突的魯西奇小組。普里戈任明確迴應了普京的信息。他表示，總統對瓦格納背叛的理解是「錯誤的」，稱自己和他的士兵們是「愛國者」，他指責莫斯科官員墮落腐敗、拒絕讓步。為了提高民眾支持率，普里戈任提出了反普京的反對派的兩個標誌性主張：俄羅斯各地區應該反對莫斯科侵佔國家的資源，俄羅斯領導層由騙子和腐敗官員組成，這些人的行為應該被公之於眾，並且將這些人繩之以法。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 儘管普里戈任完全依靠武裝部隊，但他宣佈的計劃本應為政變提供廣泛的合法性。頓河畔羅斯托夫的人們把瓦格納的戰士當作英雄來歡呼，這表明普里戈任的口號可以獲得廣泛的支持。瓦格納兵變未遂還揭示了安全部門不願積極幹預局勢。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 正如它出人意料的開始那樣，普里戈任因的「正義行軍」出人意料地結束了。白俄羅斯獨裁者盧卡申科在瓦格納和克里姆林宮之間斡旋達成了一項協議。根據協議條款，普里戈任將撤回他的部隊，而叛亂分子將免於受懲罰。與盧卡申科的協議似乎還包括祕密條款，授予瓦格納一定的自治權，併為與軍事領導層進一步建立關係確定了框架。普京的發言人德米特里·佩斯科夫（Dmitry Peskov）後來表示，這項協議得到了「俄羅斯總統的保證」。換句話説，公眾對這些非官方協議的條款和內容一無所知。儘管所有俄羅斯軍隊和普通公民都被要求參加兵變，抵抗叛亂分子，但這場危機是由兩個戰犯之間的陰謀解決的，白俄羅斯的獨裁者既扮演中間人，又扮演裁判。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 雖然這些事件的後果難以預測，但已經很清楚的是，它們將永遠改變了普京的政治系統。如果這次軍事叛亂成功的話，這個例子將激勵未來的一些嘗試。俄羅斯精英階層內部的矛盾已經從媒體蔓延到俄羅斯城市和武裝部隊的現實中。整個世界都目睹了，矛盾在法律框架之外，通過普京個人「保證」的妥協得到解決。在俄羅斯，法治已經讓位於黑手黨法典。以暴力為支持的言論比檢察官辦公室、甚至是總統宣佈即將進行懲罰的言論更有力。普京政權引發的戰爭正在成為對其自身穩更明顯的威脅，並將不可避免地導致其的最終崩潰。這種崩潰會以何種形式出現？俄羅斯受恐嚇、被剝奪權力的民眾會挺身而出嗎？這些問題的答案要到日後才能見分曉。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posle（俄語&quot;之後&quot;）彙集了持有相同觀點的作者：我們譴責戰爭，戰爭引發人道主義災難，造成了巨大的破壞並屠殺烏克蘭平民。同樣的戰爭也導致了俄羅斯的鎮壓和審查浪潮。作為左翼，我們不能脫離大多數勞動男女陷入的巨大社會不平等和無能為力來考慮這場戰爭。當然，我們也不能忽視帝國主義意識形態，這種意識形態努力維持現狀不變，傳播軍國主義言論、仇外心理和宗派主義。我們的平台旨在研究這些問題的結構，並提出解決問題的設想。Posle 歡迎並向學者、記者、活動家和目擊者——任何尋求瞭解現在和思考未來的人開放。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;原文鏈接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://posle.media/language/en/prigozhins-march-what-was-it-all-about/&quot;&gt;https://posle.media/language/en/prigozhins-march-what-was-it-all-about/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;2015 年 11 月 9 日凌晨，莫斯科的冬天，彼得·帕夫倫斯基就在此處。他提前一週聯繫了兩位年輕的記者，33 歲的攝影記者 Nigina Beroyeva 和 28 歲的獨立電視台記者 Vladimir Romensky 讓他們抵達一家位於莫斯科市中心的 24 小時咖啡館 Chocoladnitza，除了會面的時間地點，他們二人一無所知。Beroyeva 回憶道，當時他們正在咖啡廳，帕夫倫斯基晚他們 20 分鐘後到，在咖啡廳坐他們對面，沒有和他們講話，也沒有點餐。等待了十分鐘後，帕夫倫斯基走出咖啡廳，兩位記者緊隨其後。跟着戴着兜帽的他走過了地下通道，來到了盧比揚卡大樓。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;此時莫斯科時間凌晨 1 點 15 分。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;記者們跟上，然後看見帕夫倫斯基對着大樓正門做着些什麼，然後突然大門火起。此時記者才剛從包裏拿出相機。帕夫倫斯基面朝大街，略帶詭異地、平靜地站在大樓前，依舊戴着兜帽，提着汽油桶。他的背後，火焰舔舐着標誌性的盧比揚卡大樓的前門。帕夫倫斯基只是站着等待，沒有做任何宣言或表達。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 秒後，警察趕到了現場，把 Beroyeva 摁在牆上，把 Romensky 摔倒在地並騎在他身上。警察開着一輛黑色奔馳把兩位記者給帶走，隨後使用各種審訊技術拷問了他們整晚，甚至威脅他們參與共謀。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/16b923e9-eef9-4963-951a-4b12831a5a3c.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;幾小時後，互聯網上出現一段關於這次燃燒行為的解釋視頻。這段視頻現在已經找不到了，但留下的媒體對他的記錄，帕夫倫斯基自己介紹道：&lt;strong&gt;恐懼將自由的人民變成一團黏糊糊、毫無協調的軀體。 任何人頭頂都懸掛着不可避免的威脅，他們被定位追蹤、電話竊聽，以及護照管控。軍事法庭扼殺了任何自由意志的展現。但恐怖主義只能基於動物的恐懼而存在。一種原始的防禦本能會迫使人們抗爭，這是無條件的防禦反應。為了生命，值得一搏。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;次日早晨七點，兩位記者被釋放。而帕夫倫斯基被指控破壞公物罪被拘留。在這件名為「威脅」的作品發生後兩天，俄羅斯安全情報局把着火的大門外封了一層褶皺的金屬板。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在和警察爭鬥中，記者 Romensky 曾試着保護相機儲存卡，但弄斷了，所以除了參與了一次現場，他什麼材料也沒留下。不過令 Beroyeva 驚喜的是，她拍的所有照片都在，照片數據顯示，&lt;strong&gt;從第一張到最後一張拍攝間隔只有 17 秒。&lt;/strong&gt;隨後全世界的媒體，都爭相給她電話。但他們倆至今都不知道，為什麼帕夫倫斯基會選擇讓他們倆參與現場。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/754270b3-94da-4b28-a046-2e2908a64d4c.png/public&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;2016 年 2 月 16 日，作品《威脅》被俄羅斯當代藝術創新獎提名，並在網絡上的專家投票中拿到最高票，但組委會還是撤銷了該作品，並沒有提供任何解釋或理由。也因此，8 位專家辭去組委會的工作。2 月 22 日烏克蘭知名激進女權組織 FEMEN 在哥德堡藝術廳中央入口復刻了帕夫倫斯基的行動，並在網站發佈**Free Pavlensky!**聲明：「&lt;strong&gt;我們需要為捍衞人權而發聲的藝術家。自由的藝術是無法被收買或馴服的。僵化的藝術機構需要溫順服從的藝術家，而不是那些堅定的質疑和行動。鎮壓當局希望藝術家熄滅火焰，好讓他們焚燬自治。&lt;/strong&gt;」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/249723a5-8890-4ca1-8d0c-8d16a66555b9.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;2016 年 5 月 25 日，帕夫倫斯基還被關押期間，他獲得了瓦茨拉夫·哈維爾人權獎，一個在歐洲表彰捍衞公民權利的年度獎項，那時候曾經十位獲獎者中的七位仍在獄中。帕夫倫斯基的伴侶 Oksana 會替他去挪威奧斯陸領獎，他的獲獎發言中寫道，他在去法院的路上被守衞暴力毆打，膝蓋斷了，肋骨裂了，還有很多內傷，每口呼吸都是痛苦，在獄中六個月，每天都在見證警察的監控。但後來該獎項撤銷給他的 4 萬 2000 美元的獎金，認為不應授予使用暴力作為抗議手段的人，但當時帕夫倫斯基已經承諾將獎金贈予一個反抗警察腐敗和不公執法的團體 Primorsky Partisans。俄羅斯商人 Yevgeny Chichvarkin 隨後決定替他贈予獎金給該團體，帕夫倫斯基出獄後也將自己的哈維爾人權獎盃送給了 Yevgeny Chichvarkin。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16 年 6 月 8 日，在帕夫倫斯基被關押在監獄 7 個月後開庭，莫斯科法庭宣判帕夫倫斯基犯有破壞公物罪，罰款近 50 萬盧布，但他拒絕支付，並要求自己被以更嚴重的恐怖主義罪名宣判，但未果。雖盧比揚卡的大門原件在 2008 年時被替換過，燃燒的是複製品也只損壞了部分，但他最終卻被改判為破壞歷史遺蹟罪。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;帕夫倫斯基的行動時常模糊抗議、藝術和犯罪。他的行動對俄羅斯當局的反抗是明顯的，他的抗議藝術作品是俄羅斯為數不多的異見人士的表達方式之一，他指出：「我們不需要做粉飾工作的藝術家。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而真正的爭議主要在於如何辨析它是藝術，以及以藝術之名而犯罪的邊界。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;莫斯科藝術批評人 Marat Guelman 認為，帕夫倫斯基這件作品具有顯著的符號性，盧比揚卡大門是地獄之門，是世界之惡的入口，而帕夫倫斯基站在安全局火焰中的人影，對當今的俄羅斯來説具有重要的符號價值，無論是政治的還是藝術的。俄羅斯藝術新聞報記者 Maria Semendyaeva 認為，從藝術批評角度看，帕夫倫斯基創造了一幅從未有過的畫像，他利用自己的身體和媒體作為傳遞這種畫像的手段，當我們觀看它時，會激發很多人表達的慾望。他的伴侶 Oksana 説，這是一次從陳腐的官僚體系中有趣的延展，這裏面每個人都是病態的，從人到傢俱到話語到官僚垃圾語彙，我們稀釋它們並賦予新的價值。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;帕夫倫斯基對自己的藝術主張其實非常明確，雖然被認為是第三波俄羅斯行動主義或政治藝術的代表人物，但&lt;strong&gt;他認為要拋棄這些術語，而灌之以主客體藝術事件之名。在他的行動表演裏，他讓抽象的權力機制變得可見。如果權力要表現得具有攻擊性，那就必然會落入他安排的劇情、事件中去。而通常這些事件都和犯罪相關，權力體系被捲入到犯罪糾紛，表演交互就發生在管理者，即權力的主體，和被管理者，即權力的客體之間。在這個過程中，藝術顯現，並同時，權力的主體成為了藝術的客體，使之發生的，就是權力本身。&lt;/strong&gt;而另一方面，為了反抗被強加的思想，讓我們的生活解放，首先需要撕破眼前的佈景，直視我們自己淪為其人質的現實。街道、廣場這樣的公共區域成為了畫布，觀眾席和舞台融合，觀眾在無意識之間參與到了行動演出中。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b7d1fc8c-c2c0-4b78-a6b3-8fe022d2067a.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;帕夫倫斯基也區分了對事件現場的記錄和藝術檔案的區別，後者是美學意義上的圖片、文字有意安排好的創作，並被藝術家和藝術展覽在一系列判斷過程裏選擇、展出、發表、出版，而事件現場的照片無需他本人提前安排設計好。這可能也是為什麼他沒有過多和兩位記者事先交流，只是專注在事件發生。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;對於藝術同行和媒體記者來説，帕夫倫斯基的這件作品無疑是先鋒的藝術。它的視覺呈現相當清晰：&lt;strong&gt;正面曝光、黑暗圖像、燃燒畫框，在熟悉的圖景中開闢出一個新區域，如海德格爾所言，畫面中的一個「斷裂」，世界中央的裂隙。這甚至不僅僅是一個畫框，而更像是藝術本身的圖像，現代藝術作為火焰，燃燒的畫作，以及藝術家在現代藝術本質背景下的自畫像。藝術家拿着汽油罐，既是縱火者又是創造者…… 如果説馬列維奇的黑方塊是繪畫的絕對化，那麼這個作品則是對現代藝術本質的象徵性表達……在帕夫連斯基的作品中所有發生的一切都可以稱為「藝術家在現代藝術背景下的自畫像」。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/3f097249-ec7d-44d4-a0e5-b76a078a1f41.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;但站在藝術對立視角的也大有人在，一位人權運動人士 L. Alekseeva 批評道，如果這是一場表演，那就是一場愚蠢的表演，如果當時有人在裏面，逃不出來，被燒傷，會發生什麼？他應該去看病，任何一個正常人都不會做這樣的表演。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;的確，如同他所説的，帕夫倫斯基時常被指控精神問題，如同對梵高的天才和精神問題的左右為難一樣，鑑定帕夫倫斯基的精神狀態和專業創作行為之間的區別也使精神分析師踟躕。雖然精神病醫生多次診斷帕夫倫斯基精神正常，完全清楚自己的行為會導致肉身和社會危險，但案件調查官依舊拒絕承認帕夫倫斯基的行為是當代藝術主張，法庭上他向帕夫倫斯基説：我不反對藝術，但你必須區分藝術和犯罪行為。帕夫倫斯基迴應説：事實上，藝術是沒有界限的，所謂非法行為只不過是他們用來限制藝術表達的幌子。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;話雖如此，但其實帕夫倫斯基所有作品除了他自己，誰也不會受傷，比如《威脅》作品裏，他選擇了夜深人靜的凌晨執行，帶的汽油也並不多。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ba85cb24-e7a9-4e85-b1e7-5fe094562017.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;在今天這個時代，所謂人人都是藝術家的時代，藝術被拉下神壇。重要的可能不再是藝術的審美價值，藝術超越庸常生活的價值，而是藝術家重新使其產生社會功效，不惜代價地刺穿虛偽的麪皮。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一位和他有過交流的藝術家寫道：「藝術發生在語詞匹配行為之時，發生在你對自己的注意力掌控之時，即便當你難以微笑，你的肋骨斷裂，藝術依舊發生。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;好，今天的會議到此為止。如果你覺得這次會議讓你又學習到了新的思想，請把會議內容發送給更多人，或去會員區資助我們的會議，讓我們可以一直把會開下去。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/e7e6ec92-0acf-4da9-966c-1acf8faf9a04.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;【另】我是個獨立創作者，除了視頻博主外，我也從事藝術創作，過去十年以影像、行為、表演、文本、社會實踐等方式創作。因題材原因，此類項目難以獲取商業價值，也不想被算法和系統籠罩，故在粉絲平台設立賬號，希望獲得你的支持。希望也藉此證明，創作者可以獨立自由創作。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;愛發電：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://afdian.net/a/actioninaction&quot;&gt;https://afdian.net/a/actioninaction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;Patreon：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/actioninaction&quot;&gt;https://www.patreon.com/actioninaction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>2021 Cuban Protests: A Product of Both Pandemic-induced Socioeconomic Crisis and Authoritarian Decay</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;Recently, in March 2024, Cuba witnessed large-scale protests due to rising prices, economic downturn, and hardships in people&#39;s livelihoods. Similar protests had occurred in Cuba in 2021 as well. At that time,&amp;nbsp; I had written a commentary on the protests. I am posting this article again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting on July 11, 2021, Cuba witnessed large-scale protest demonstrations, with thousands of Cubans taking to the streets of the capital, Havana, and major cities, chanting slogans like &quot;freedom&quot; and singing revolutionary songs, leading to intense clashes with law enforcement that have yet to fully subside. This marked a highly unusual occurrence of mass political protest activities in Cuba since the Communist Party took power in 1959. Cuba is one of the few remaining Leninist-style socialist one-party authoritarian states in the world, strategically located near the United States, garnering significant international attention to its protests. People are curious about its causes, speculating about its potential outcomes and impacts. The international community, especially countries with special ties to Cuba like the United States, closely monitors the developments of these protests, poised to respond accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cuban protests stem from the public health crisis and economic turmoil brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. After the global spread of COVID-19, many countries, especially developing ones like Cuba, faced severe challenges. Despite having a relatively robust healthcare system, Cuba struggled to contain the spread of the virus. What particularly angered the populace was the Cuban government&#39;s refusal to join the international vaccine distribution program (COVAX), opting instead to develop its own vaccines, but progress was slow, supply was inadequate, and people doubted the effectiveness of the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, COVID-19 severely impacted Cuba&#39;s fragile economy. According to Reuters, the Cuban economy contracted by 10.9% in 2020 and declined by an additional 2% in the first six months of the following year. Tourism is a vital industry for Cuba, but COVID-19 dealt a devastating blow to it, leaving many Cubans in the tourism sector without income and causing Cuba to lack sufficient foreign currency to purchase essential resources like food and fuel, further hindering the development of primary and secondary industries. Cuba plunged into an even more severe shortage of goods than usual, forcing many Cubans to queue for essential supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, COVID-19 merely acted as a catalyst; the root causes of the protests in Cuba lie in the long-standing authoritarian political system and the dilapidated planned economy model, along with the suppression of people&#39;s freedoms and resulting material scarcity and widespread poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the victory of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cuba has long practiced one-party dictatorship politically, with the Cuban Communist Party monopolizing political power and banning the existence of political opposition forces. Basic elements of democratic politics, such as multiparty elections, freedom of association and assembly, and the right to protest, are entirely absent in Cuba. Economically, Cuba has long adhered to a planned economy and a state-owned economic system, leading to low productivity and a lack of economic vitality among the people. Although Cuba&#39;s political and economic system has achieved some successes, such as a comprehensive social security and public service system including free education, healthcare, and housing (with quality not as poor as that in North Korea or pre-reform China, and resource allocation relatively fair), as well as a significantly better security environment compared to other Latin American countries, the overall drawbacks outweigh the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the collapse of the Soviet bloc in the 1990s, Cuba began gradual reforms, taking bigger steps into the 21st century. Following the 2011 Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba, then-General Secretary Raúl Castro implemented measures such as economic marketization, attracting foreign investment, loosening political and ideological control, legal reforms, and improving relations with the United States. Under these measures, the Cuban economy showed some improvement, with a certain increase in national income, and the external environment for Cuba also improved. In 2016, US-Cuba relations began to normalize, with President Obama making a historic visit to Cuba. The future of Cuba seemed bright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after Donald Trump took office in 2016, he reversed almost all of Obama&#39;s policies and agreements regarding US-Cuba relations and reinstated sanctions against Cuba. This was a heavy blow to Cuba, leading to worsened diplomatic relations, severe economic damage, and setbacks for reformist factions within the party, resulting in the rise of conservative forces. Cuba once again became more closed-off, at least halting its progress toward greater openness. Its refusal to join the international vaccine distribution led by Western countries reflects its isolationist stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the sudden deterioration of the external environment following Trump&#39;s presidency, the stagnation of Cuban reforms naturally has internal causes as well. Compared to countries like China and Vietnam, Cuba has been much less open, especially in terms of marketization. Cuba&#39;s economy is backward, but its social security system is relatively robust, leading to a lack of strong willingness for change from top to bottom. While Cuba&#39;s political dictatorship is not harsh, it is closed and conservative. Under this &quot;mild dictatorship,&quot; social contradictions are not severe, making it easy for both the regime and the people to be content with the status quo, lacking the courage to make drastic changes. Consequently, Cuba&#39;s reform efforts have been sporadic, with no clear results over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak of the current protests was stimulated by the pandemic-induced socioeconomic crisis, which fueled the growth of opposition forces. When people&#39;s health and basic needs were threatened by the epidemic, they finally stopped tolerating and accommodating, leading to this late protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing the protests, Cuban authorities have employed both soft and hard tactics. On one hand, Cuba&#39;s top leader, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, acknowledged the need for government improvement and implemented measures such as lifting import restrictions to address shortages and increasing wages. On the other hand, military and police forces were deployed to forcefully disperse demonstrations, arrest protesters, detain activists, and temporarily cut off the internet. Officially, the economic and public health crises were blamed on the United States&#39; blockade and sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protests in Cuba triggered strong reactions from the United States, which has a complicated relationship with the island nation. The Biden administration expressed support for the Cuban protesters, but unlike the Trump administration, which sought to dismantle Communist rule, Biden and his left-leaning government are not actively seeking to overthrow the Cuban government. Meanwhile, Cuban exile groups in the United States strongly support and assist the protests in Cuba, calling for international attention to stop the repression of protesters by the Cuban government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation in Cuba also involves the fierce ideological divide across Latin America. The Communist Party of Cuba positions itself as a model for left-wing revolution and leftist regimes in Latin America and supports other leftist forces in the region. Consequently, left-wing governments in Latin America tend to support the Cuban government. Conversely, right-wing forces view the Cuban government as a foe and actively support anti-government movements. Following the outbreak of protests in Cuba, left-leaning governments like Venezuela and Nicaragua unsurprisingly supported the Cuban government, while right-leaning governments like Brazil, Uruguay, and Ecuador sided with the protesters. Some left-wing leaders, such as Mexican President Obrador, expressed sympathy for the protesters while opposing foreign intervention in Cuba&#39;s internal affairs. It is worth noting that while most left-wing forces in Latin America do not endorse Cuba&#39;s authoritarian model, they support Cuba out of shared socialist sentiments, anti-American and anti-imperialist principles, and practical necessity. Similarly, right-wing forces in Latin America supporting democratic protests often have tangled connections with previous authoritarian right-wing military regimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protests in Cuba are unlikely to lead to the collapse of the Communist regime. However, they mark the beginning of a new chapter in Cuban history. Opposition forces within Cuba have organized and grown in scale, and dissenting voices have transitioned from the private sphere to public spaces. The Cuban government must acknowledge the increasingly assertive and rebellious spirit of the populace and can no longer afford to postpone meaningful reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;近日（2024 年 3 月），因物價上漲、經濟蕭條、民生困苦，古巴發大規模抗議活動。而在 2021 年，古巴已發生過類似抗議。筆者當時曾撰文評論。在此再發一次。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2021 年 7 月 11 日起，古巴發生大規模抗議示威，成千上萬的古巴人走上首都哈瓦那和各主要城市街頭，並呼喊「自由」等口號和歌唱革命歌曲，與警方發生激烈衝突，至今未有平息。這是自 1959 年古巴共產黨執政以來，在古巴極為罕見的大規模民眾政治性抗議活動。古巴是世界上現存寥寥無幾的列寧式社會主義一黨專政國家之一，又緊靠美國，戰略地位極為重要。因此，古巴的抗議得到了世界的關注。人們好奇的探究它的起因，猜測其可能的走向及產生的影響。美國在內的國際社會尤其與古巴有着特殊關聯的國家更是時刻注意着古巴這次抗議的動向，以做出相應的反應。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;本次古巴抗議，肇因於新冠流行造成的古巴公共衞生危機和經濟危機。新冠在全球流行後，許多國家都陷入嚴重的困境，發展中國家尤其如此，古巴也不例外。雖然古巴有着世界上較好的醫療衞生體系，但仍然無力抵抗新冠的肆虐。最令民眾不滿的，是古巴政府拒絕加入國際疫苗分配計劃（COVAX），而是由本國自行研發疫苗，但研發進度緩慢、供給不足，人們對疫苗有效性也表示懷疑。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而新冠同樣也衝擊着脆弱的古巴經濟。據路透社報道，2020 年古巴經濟收縮了 10.9%，今年前六個月又在此基礎上下降 2%。旅遊業是古巴的支柱產業，而新冠對旅遊業造成了毀滅性的打擊，不僅讓大批從事旅遊業的古巴人喪失收入來源，還導致古巴沒有足夠的外匯購買糧食、燃油等重要資源，進而又影響了第一第二產業的發展。古巴陷入比平常更嚴重的物資短缺狀況中，許多古巴民眾只能排隊購買生活必需品。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而新冠疫情只是一個導火索，古巴爆發抗議的根源是長期以來古巴實行的專制政治制度以及凋敝的計劃經濟模式，以及這種制度和模式對人民自由的壓制、導致的物質匱乏和普遍貧窮。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;自 1959 年古巴革命勝利後，政治上長期實行一黨專制，古巴共產黨壟斷了政治權力，禁絕了政治反對力量的存在。民主政治的基本要素，如多元競爭的普選、組黨和結社自由、遊行示威的自由等，古巴都是完全沒有的。而經濟上則長期實行計劃經濟和公有制經濟，導致人民生產積極性低落，經濟活力低下。雖然古巴的這種政治經濟制度也取得了一定成果，如完全免費的教育、醫療、住房等完善的社會保障和公共服務體系（而且質量並不算差，起碼比朝鮮及改革開放前中國的同類福利在質量上好多了，相關資源分配也更公平均等），以及相較於拉美其他國家好的多的治安環境，但整體仍然弊大於利。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1990 年代蘇東劇變後，古巴開始逐漸進行改革，到 21 世紀邁出更大步伐。如 2011 年的古共六大後，時任古共總書記的勞爾·卡斯特羅實行了經濟市場化改革和吸引外資、放鬆政治和意識形態控制、法治改革、改善對美關係等措施。在這些措施之下，古巴經濟有了一些起色，國民收入有了一定提高，古巴的外部環境也得到改善。2016 年，美古關係走向正常化，奧巴馬對古巴進行了歷史性訪問。古巴的前景似乎一片光明。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;但是，2016 年特朗普上台之後，廢除了奧巴馬時期關於美古關係的幾乎所有政策和協定，重新恢復對古巴的制裁。這對古巴是沉重的打擊，不僅導致外交處境惡化、經濟嚴重受損，還打擊了黨內改革派，導致保守派得勢。古巴再次趨於封閉，至少停止了進行更大程度開放的步伐。這次古巴拒絕加入西方國家主導的國際疫苗分配，就體現了對外閉鎖的一面。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;除了特朗普上台後外部環境的陡然惡化，古巴改革的停滯自然還有內因。相對於中國和越南等國，古巴的開放程度本來就要小的多，尤其經濟方面市場化程度很有限。古巴經濟落後但社會保障程度不低，導致從上到下沒有特別強烈的變革意願。古巴的政治專制雖然並不嚴酷，但是同時也很封閉和因循。這種「溫和的專制」下社會矛盾不劇烈，反而容易令政權和民眾安於現狀，缺乏破釜沉舟的勇氣。於是古巴的改革走走停停，長期沒有個鮮明的結果。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;而本次抗議的爆發，是新冠疫情導致的民生危機刺激了反對勢力的滋長。當疫病下健康和基本衣食住行供給受到威脅，人民終於不再忍耐和遷就，發生了這場遲來的抗議。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;面對抗議，古巴執政者軟硬兼施。一方面，古巴最高領導人即古共第一書記卡內爾承認政府需要改進，採取瞭如取消商品進口限制彌補物資短缺、提高工資待遇等措施；另一方面，派遣軍警使用暴力手段驅散示威、抓捕示威者，逮捕社會活動人士，並且一度切斷了互聯網。官方還將經濟和公共衞生危機歸咎於美國的封鎖和制裁。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;古巴的抗議在與其恩怨糾葛緊密的美國引發劇烈反應。美國拜登政府表達了對古巴示威民眾的支持，但不像之前處心積慮想摧毀古共統治的特朗普政權，作為民主黨人的拜登及其左傾的政府無意趁機推翻古共政權。而流亡美國的古巴人團體則強烈支持和協助古國內的抗議，呼籲國際社會關注和阻止古共對示威民眾的鎮壓。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;古巴局勢還牽連着左右之爭激烈的整個拉丁美洲。古共自詡拉美左翼革命和左翼政權的模範，大力支持拉美其他左翼勢力。因此拉美諸國左翼力量也投桃報李支持古共政權。而右翼力量則對古共視若寇仇，積極支持古反政府勢力。本次古巴抗議爆發後，不出意料的，如委內瑞拉、尼加拉瓜等左翼執政的國家選擇支持古共，巴西、烏拉圭、厄瓜多爾等右翼執政的國家則站在示威者一邊。還有的左翼領導人如墨西哥總統奧夫拉多爾，則在同情示威者同時，表達了反對外國干涉古巴內政的態度。當然，值得説明的是，拉美大多數左翼力量並不贊同古巴的專制主義模式，而是出於傾向社會主義的共同情感、反美反帝的道義和現實需要支持古巴。而支持民主示威的拉美各右翼勢力，也不乏與以前專制的右翼軍人政權有千絲萬縷的聯繫。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;古巴這次抗議應不會導致古共政權垮台。但是它開啓了古巴歷史新的一頁。古巴國內的反對力量已經組織化規模化，並且反抗的聲音由私人領域走向公共場合。古共也必須正視越來越有權利意識和反抗精神的民眾，不再推遲改革得過且過。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;（本文已發表於《上報》，封面圖片取自 BBC）&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>論語漫讀（36）：使民敬，忠以勸 — 讓老百姓既畏懼又愛戴</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.red-publish.com/book/2990&quot;&gt;電子書：《論語漫讀》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;季康子問：「使民敬，忠以勸，如之何？」子曰：「臨之以莊則敬，孝慈則忠，舉善而教不能則勸」&lt;/strong&gt;（為政第二）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/fdb1a7a5-d2f0-41c9-85d0-85574b09fdb6.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;季康子是魯國的貴族，魯哀公當政時，實際掌握魯國大權，把國君給架空了。子是他的爵位，貴族有公、侯、伯、子和男五等爵位，子是第四等。康是他的諡號。康的含義很廣，諡法中康的註解有二十餘條，&lt;strong&gt;「淵源流通曰康；溫柔好樂曰康；安樂撫民曰康；合民安樂曰康」&lt;/strong&gt;等等，意思都很好。看來這人有些能耐，魯國人對他的評價不低。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;他就問孔子，「要使老百姓敬重自己，忠於自己而且還肯幹活，怎麼辦？」孔子回答到：「在老百姓面前顯得很莊嚴，他們就會尊敬你；提倡孝順父母慈愛子女，百姓就會忠於你；重用善幹活的人，教導能力差的人，百姓就會自我勉勵，加倍努力了。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;此問當發生在孔子結束流亡回到魯國後，這時他當政後才可能與孔子相見。季康子起用了孔子的弟子冉求，子路等，委以重任。可能看孔子年紀太大了，七十左右的人了，沒有任用孔子。按現在的高級幹部退休年齡規定，也應該退休了。但他很重視孔子的意見，相當於請孔子當顧問，可能還給予較高的地位和待遇。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;「以」，而的意思。「勸」，自我勉勵，自我激勵。季康子是貴族，孔子這裏就不用像回答哀公那樣「對曰」了。「舉善」的「善」，我看到的註解都解釋為「善良」。但聯繫到自我勉勵肯幹活，理解為善於和熟練做某事更合理些。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;與魯哀公問的「何為則民服」相比，季康子關心的問題則是得到老百姓的敬重，忠心和賣力。他權勢很大，不怎麼擔心老百姓不服從。而他不止想得到老百姓的服從，還想得到老百姓的敬重，忠心和賣力，希望老百姓態度上要恭敬，內心要忠誠，幹活要積極。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;針對季康子的問題，孔子的辦法是，要想得到老百姓的敬重，就得要嚴肅，要有架子有排場有威風，要與老百姓保持距離，保持神祕，讓老百姓仰望。如果與老百姓太親密太隨和，就得不到老百姓的敬重。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而想得到老百姓發自內心的忠誠，就得提倡子孝父慈。自己孝順父母，慈愛子女，臣下和百姓就會跟着效仿。季康子父親不再了，可能母親還在。百姓如能將孝移情到統治者身上，視統治者為父母，就能得到老百姓的忠心了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而重用獎勵能幹的，教導技能差的，這也是現代管理的重要激勵手段。孔子早在兩千多年前就知道應用，還是很了不起。他可能是從馴導牲畜中體會出來的。牲畜幹活好，就給獎勵，幹得不好，就接着教或者給予懲罰。當然，懲罰是法家重要手段，但儒家也不排斥。儒家的統治手段以道德感化為主，以刑罰為輔。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;孔子特別重視統治者要莊重。在另外場合也強調過。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子曰：「知及之，仁不能守之，雖得之，必失之。知及之，仁能守之，不莊以蒞之，則民不敬。知及之，仁能守之，莊以蒞之，動之不以禮，未善也」&lt;/strong&gt;（衞靈公第十五）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這段話顯然是講統治者應當如何治理國家。孔子説，「統治邦國，才智夠了，但仁德不夠守住。雖然得到了君位，也必然會失去」。仁德不夠，臣屬和老百姓的支持度低，長此以往，必然會下台。「才智和仁德都夠了，但在臣民面前不莊重，那就得不到臣民的敬重」。孔子不贊同「齊之以刑」，靠恐懼來讓臣民服從，但還是想讓臣民對統治者有一絲絲畏懼之心，所以統治者必須在臣民面前顯得威嚴和崇高。「才智、仁德和莊重都夠了，但不以禮節差遣臣子，也不夠盡善盡美。」君主一般不會直接差遣老百姓。孔子主張&lt;strong&gt;「君使臣以禮」&lt;/strong&gt;（八佾第三），就是在言語和態度上要尊重臣下，不要隨意喝罵，支使來支使去。但按他這句話的意思，「不以禮」也基本合格了，只是不完美而已。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;馬基雅維利在他的《君主論》中認為，臣民對君主的感情分為愛戴、畏懼、憎恨三類。君主應當避免受臣民憎恨，然後在愛戴與畏懼之間尋求平衡，而讓畏懼多於愛戴是最佳狀態。如果非要在兩者之間選擇，那寧肯讓臣民畏懼。孔子則主張統治者優先得到臣民的忠心和愛戴，其次再讓臣民敬服。兩人對愛戴和畏懼的重要性認識不同。季康子將「敬」放在「忠」的前面，説明他更希望讓臣民畏懼他。&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;新的一年，行動可以柔軟也堅韌地發生，願你照料好身心和彼此。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;「關懷匯流」計劃萌芽於 2023 年倫敦設計雙年展的 CARE 主題館 (Care Pavilion)，該項目從多學科視野出發，通過展覽、委任創作、儀式表演、論壇、宣言、出版等方式，探討「care」在當前時代的狀況與形貌，以及其多重實踐的倫理與潛能。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在執行該項目的過程中，我們需要反覆處理的問題和挑戰之一是：哪裏是「care」的現場？從物理空間的角度來説，展覽項目發生在英國倫敦；從思想上來説，聚焦這一議題的關心與具身行動當然可以在任何地方、與任何人關聯。與此同時，既然希望&lt;a

林子皓&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;01.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;陳彬華&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;想象自我關懷的解放意涵&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;首先要從我自己的背景説起，目前我的身份是「青年行動者」和心理諮詢師。我的本科專業是社會工作，它有一個很獨特的視角，專業老師經常給我們講一句話叫做「人在情境中」，即每一個人都是在具體的情境裏，在整體的生態系統中。因此，&lt;strong&gt;當我們去處理一個人所謂的「問題」時，不能只是去處理他個體心理的部分，而是面對着整個實際情境。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但是，實際工作中，實踐者常常是利用不同系統的力量把一個人擺到所謂「正確」的位置上，而不是把個體的行為放在社會歷史的脈絡去理解。我覺得這是有矛盾存在的。一方面社會工作將把社會正義作為很重要的專業的使命。但是另一方面，社工又經常被視作一種軟性的社會控制工具。那麼，如果社會照護（social care）都是一種控制的話，那我們去關心彼此的空間到底在哪裏？或者説，難道我們只能依靠個體之間的那一種支持，或是家庭當中的支持？所以，在這種探索脈絡下，我進入到了社區學習與發展的領域。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;當時在全球範圍內，以弗萊雷為代表的批判教育學廣為流傳，這些內容對當時的一些社區工作者產生了非常大的影響。他們發現除了去做一些很基本的文教活動之外，還可以去做一些比較「徹底」的一些事情，例如帶大家一起去做自我教育、公眾教育，指向共同的目標，一起去行動。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;由此，激進的議程不斷凸顯。但是在這個過程中，我們會看到很多問題。比如上野千鶴子在書裏舉到一個例子：日本早期的學生運動號稱打倒天皇，內部的女性卻在被或顯性、或隱性地壓迫。女權主義當中的一些思考給到了我很多啓發。但當時直接影響到我的是解放心理學。解放心理學產生於全球戰爭動盪的時期。在那時，人們發現——&lt;strong&gt;如果我們沒有解決招致我們精神健康的一些社會問題，那麼我們永遠不可能真正的達成所謂的療愈。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;西方的個體心理學決定了他在面對社會問題時會傾向於考慮個體，即被壓迫者。而我們應該去看到個體之上的社會層面，一併考慮個體與社會的痛苦，最終落腳點在於創傷本身——創傷必定來自傷害，傷害則源自外界環境，環境中便包含了壓迫者或施暴者。這時，創傷就成為我理解個體心理，困擾我們內心的創痛和社會議題之間的切面。當我們個體和社會產生交叉並造成傷害的時候，創傷就出現了。在這個視角下，創傷成為了社會後果。&lt;strong&gt;因此，我們真正地去處理創傷就意味着我們要去關懷社會，以及我們在關懷社會問題時，也要考慮到個體的創傷。&lt;/strong&gt;怎樣避免二元對立？這需要很多的摸索，我想跟大家分享我的其中一項思考——關於創傷和內在壓迫的話題。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;波瓦（Augusto Boal）是巴西重要的戲劇家，他受到解放神學和當時整體社會環境的影響，提出了一套戲劇方法，號召被壓迫者抗爭。他的劇場實踐在早期傾向於政治宣傳，而後在被壓迫者教育學和實踐經歷的影響下轉向了更為民主、參與的方法，並將其稱之為「被壓迫者劇場」。當波瓦的工作得到國際上的認可後，他試圖在其他的國家推廣被壓迫者劇場，希望也能給大家帶來解放。當他在巴西的時候，巴西的軍政府裏存在明確的反派——警察，然而在法國，他卻找不到非常明確的壓迫者——但人們確實感到抑鬱、焦慮、無力乃至絕望。這時，壓迫更像是一個整體的社會氛圍，變成一種規訓，它內化成我們內心的一部分了，所以波瓦將其稱之為「頭腦內的警察」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;進一步，我想説明我們是如何在心理和劇場的領域工作的。諮詢常常會把一些東西外化出來，有時我們也會帶一些戲謔的成分將對方的話重複，來幫助他們把抽象的心理具體化。在諮詢或是一些劇場形式中，會有治療師或其他參與者替你將內心扮演出來。例如，參與者們會扮演「主角」心中無數壓迫的聲音。不過，這時「主角」其實很難直接站出來去反駁這些聲音，於是，治療師或其他參與者就會站出來，去見證事件的發生，去反駁這些聲音，去連接個體與社會結構。這個連接意味着將批評的聲音標識為一個外部進來的東西，並進一步分析內心聲音的來源——來自父母？來自家鄉？還是來自某個團體？特別是當參與者發現大家都擁有同樣的經歷，那我們會發現，&lt;strong&gt;我們不僅僅面對的是原生家庭或是人際關係上的問題，而是社會的癥結，是我們社會浸透內心的聲音。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這是我非常想分享的一個切入點，它只是其中的連接點之一。還有很多連接的可能需要我們去探索，從個體或者一個治療性的環境裏，演變為與團體和社羣共同工作的方法。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;02.&amp;nbsp;殷艾雯&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「療愈社會」在療愈什麼？&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;我是一個設計教育者，我所教學的專業叫做在地設計。「在地設計」是一種特殊的設計方法和理念，強調設計師應當將自己置身於情境（situation）之中，認為自己是情境、局勢中的一員，以個體肉身去感受現實，而非以一種局外人的姿態去縱觀全局，從而得出一種離地的設計方案。在教學實踐當中，我經常向學生強調個體感受、個體故事在在地設計中的重要性。在我看來，只有設計師從自身做起，認為（自身的）生命經驗是值得珍惜，值得理解的，並且堅信這樣真誠的生命經驗必然能夠與更廣泛的羣體和更廣闊的世界產生共鳴，這位設計師才真正擁有在地設計的基礎。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在教學的過程中，時常會有學生誤會我們只是在貪求學生的個人故事，甚至認為我們教的不是設計。但實際上我們是鼓勵&lt;strong&gt;個體先充分感受身在其中的痛楚與不適——我們今天把它叫做「私憤」——在充分接納自身的私憤以後，利用自身私憤的動能去聯結更多的人，從而看到私憤當中的公憤成分——即社會中存在的結構性問題和不公正&lt;/strong&gt;——最後我們希望學生可以學會超越自身的私憤，去完成公憤中應有的義務和責任。從而實現對個體和社會的療愈和改變。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;私憤和公憤之間的差異在於，私憤通常是個體成長過程中未解決的創傷所導致的，而公憤則涉及更廣泛的結構性問題。然而，私憤和公憤並不是完全對立的，它們通常同時存在於個體之中。在實踐中，很多人往往難以正視自己的私憤和內在創傷，尤其在面對社會公義問題時。有些行動者會產生過度反應，這往往是因為他們個人的創傷被觸發。然而，他們往往不願意正視自己的私憤，並將所有的憤怒歸結為結構性問題，這樣的有意無意地用公憤包裹私憤的做法，往往會在表達公憤訴求的行動中將問題的進一步複雜化。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我們在荷蘭舉辦過一期讓人印象深刻的「浮萍定海」。那一場來了很多現實中的行動者，ta 們在遊戲中展現出了很多行動者公憤裹挾私憤的各種形態，這映照了很多種社會行動失敗的路徑，比如為了公共目標完全不顧自身狀況，反而導致社羣不得不犧牲大量資源去挽救 ta，比如不斷地提倡大家參與行動，卻在人們前來參與時以各種理由拒絕，令自已永遠孤身一人；比如熱衷描繪藍圖卻沒有實際的聯結行動，乃至以情緒勒索的方式來指責羣眾冷漠，等等。&lt;strong&gt;當我們無法分辨內心追求當中私憤與公憤的邊界與纏繞時，很容易將公憤的內容工具化，為自身不可言説的需求來服務。&lt;/strong&gt;很多行動的時候我們對一些人事的失望，往往也來源於此。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;很多時候我們受傷了，往外看是容易的，但向內去看到自己私憤的內容，或看到自己貌似正義的公憤表達中其實隱含着修復個體創傷的需求，接納整合兩者是困難的。彬華之前的反思，我們可以理解為擔憂心理學會通過療愈私憤而消解公憤，這也是我們不願意看到的。更理想的狀況是大家能夠辨析兩者並且將兩者的療愈從一種互相排斥轉換成互相滋養的關係。也就是説，能夠在療愈自己的時候也不放棄這個公憤當中應有的責任和義務。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;回到設計上來講， 在社會設計裏常常出現因為視角過高而看不到底層的真實，即容易無視個體乃至社羣的日常生活以及心理動能。這種設計思路假設社會正義是應然之舉，因此私憤在此沒有任何容身之處。這種設計思路應用到現實當中，無論成功與否都會讓人羞於面對自己的內在需求，覺得我的公憤當中竟敢有私憤。但個體的需求是不會消失的，所以造成的結果往往是要麼公憤包裝私憤，要麼私憤消解公憤，要麼公憤壓抑私憤，這對個體和社會都是難以形成有效的療愈和發展。這也是為什麼我要提倡這種在地設計，不僅僅是將自己置身於現實當中，和現實中的人站在同一個視角產生聯結，我們自己也要和自己的內在世界產生聯結，這樣我們才能以自己的具體肉身，與具體的人在一起。這樣的設計者才能夠和人們在一起創造一個真正的共同體。&lt;strong&gt;能夠療愈自我的設計者才能夠療愈大眾。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;03.&amp;nbsp;陳怡寧&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;從身體打開別樣連結與關懷&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;我前陣子去貴州做了一個和洞穴有關的活動。其中有個洞穴用於苗族洞葬，我們在兩位苗族鬼師的帶領下進洞。鬼師主持葬禮，為亡者開路。在烏漆墨黑的洞中行走的時候，我發現鬼師們好像並不需要光照，而且走路時幾乎沒有聲音。他們就像洞穴的一部分，即使身處洞穴之外，仍然和洞穴存在某種聯繫。這讓我感覺很神奇。我們或多或少也許可以從身體結構和物理規律找到些如何讓腳步聲變輕的方法，但這種像是融為一體的腳步聲和連結到底從哪裏來？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;洞穴後來用它的方式給了我一些答案。幾天之後在另一個洞穴深處，領頭的三哥帶我們七彎八拐進入一個洞中之洞，並讓我們關掉頭燈。最後一盞頭燈熄滅，我瞬間丟失了眼睛。突然失明讓我緊張地睜大眼睛舉起雙手，卻驚恐地發現是真的伸手不見五指，睜眼閉眼沒有差別。三哥讓我們靜止，專注呼吸。我放鬆下來，周遭的一切流進我的身體，巖壁的凹凸水痕、空氣的流向濕度，都以 ta 們獨有的方式和我的身體共振、連結，洞穴因此勾勒出形態，而我的存在本身也以一種最為根本而純粹的方式被感知，被確認和承託。「I am because we (/you) are.」 這種連結給予的自我確認無關任何社會身份、屬性或價值，像是一個無時無刻無處不在的擁抱，蒸騰出廣袤的安定感，無條件的溫柔和慈悲。彼此的主體性在這樣的相互關係中得到「體」認。這是一種什麼感覺呢？現在，如果你方便的話可以站起來，試着去感受：不是自己站在地面上，而是地板、大地在觸摸自己，周遭的空氣在呼吸自己，將自己呼進呼出。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;這種對存在本身關係性的感知可以在不同情境中被召喚和習慣，然而在工具化和便利性需要不斷升級的社會環境中，人與人、人與物之間的關係趨向單一，這種最為自然基本的身體感受，就像重力一樣，經常被忽視，被悄悄地剝奪。&lt;/strong&gt;對存在本身關係性的領悟和覺察，我認為是在關懷實踐中很重要的一環。照護和關懷需要在這樣的關係性中自然落成。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;洞穴活動結束之後，我隨一位朋友繼續在貴州停留。某天深夜，我們去貴州縣城一處「易地扶貧搬遷」住宅區。規劃齊整的居民樓寂寂，走到某處，我們打算穿過草坪去樓裏看看。抬腳正要跨進草坪，我感覺身後揹包的提手被向後拉了一下，轉身回看，發現朋友在兩米開外，背後沒有鈎狀物也沒有人。之後的幾天裏我感覺腳步沉重，內臟懸浮，像套上了玻璃罩子。直到上了一處海拔三千米的山脊。開闊處的風力發動機和背風處的墳冢交錯出兩種截然不同的人地關係。我們從一處墳冢去往另一處墳冢，走向某個折了機翼的發動機。途中，我突然腳底打滑，差點從坡上滾下來，照平常肯定是嚇壞了，玄妙的是，那瞬間身心平穩，我感到什麼東西落地了，連帶着我的玻璃罩子也沒了，我也落地了——我們共同促成了某件事情的發生。這個認知來得如此順理成章，別無選擇，也無需別的解釋。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在貴州的這些奇妙經歷和感受總是會讓我想到接觸即興，這是一種探索身體結構、重量和重力之間關係的舞動。它強調在不斷變化的動能關係中自然生髮身體運動。墜落、翻滾、承重、傾倒，對關係性的覺察刻進意識之前的身體反應，呼應古老樸素的生存智慧。它同時也揭示所有看似單人的舞動都是某種共同促成的自然流動。有關照護和關懷的具身認知隨之而來。墜落不再是墜落，而是來自另一片空間的承託，我翻滾你旋轉我，我揹負你，而你也在擁抱我。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;在對關係性的覺察和維繫中自然生髮關懷和照護，就是行動本身。&lt;/strong&gt;這不是某個社會議題的附屬品或創傷藥膏。它需要持續不斷地身體力行，成為日常。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;04.&amp;nbsp;趙伊人&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;內化淤泥的清理&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;今天的討論讓我有相互傾聽和共鳴的感覺，我感覺我作為個體匯流在一個巨大的河流裏面的感覺，好像自己只是一個小小的水滴，和大家融合的同時也能清晰的感受自己的邊界和價值，我覺得這種場域非常珍貴。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;今天這個主題沒有要用公憤包裹私憤，很多策劃人通常會以一種某個議題多麼重要多那麼緊急，大家一定要來聽，或者「再不關懷就不行了」——這種危機創造式的話語會很容易讓個體或者觀眾進入一種「Fight, Flight or Freeze Response」（3F 反應，逃避反應），也就是要麼戰鬥、要麼逃跑或僵住的狀況。我覺得乃一和書韻在開場奠定了很好的基調，也就是&lt;strong&gt;「從自己的需要出發」&lt;/strong&gt;，雖然只是輕輕的、短短的，好像很謙虛地講了一句「策劃這個活動是我們自己的需要」，但奠定了一種非常 self care 的底色。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;結合自己的實踐經歷，我將這個過程概括為&lt;strong&gt;「清理自己身體或者日常生活中各種外在的沼澤內化於我的淤泥」&lt;/strong&gt;——它不是你在做一個多麼重要的什麼革命性的東西（當然如果你重新定義革命的話也可以是），但是很重要的是你承認將清理內化淤泥作為起點；而不是那種我們在社羣裏也常見的外來拜訪或者話語的道德譴責或者綁架：比如，你為什麼不去投入更重要的 political agenda 裏？你為什麼不這樣做，不那樣做？一開始會特別容易被那種東西綁架，但只要堅定地基於自我關懷、尊重自己，你會發現和慢慢體會到行動可以是非常柔軟的，就像剛才怡寧那段非常詩意的講述那種柔軟的感覺。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我所工作的基金會最近在開一個關於「積極老齡化」的新公益業務線，今天上午我們還在組讀書會讀老年後如何進行個人第二次成長的書，書名叫《生命的對話》。從書裏我引申出的三個非常重要的點也和今天的討論有關：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;第一，臣服於自己的身體，其中很多用到戲劇、接觸即興等方法；第二，重新發現或者重新詮釋自己的記憶，就是你怎麼講述你的生命故事；第三點，感受到自己的靈魂連接着比我更大的東西。這三點是在個人成長中是非常重要的東西，這樣你才能真的接納自己，也更能同理別人，你能更能柔軟地行動，也同時為社會做出一點貢獻。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;05.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;張煒侖&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;關懷如微小蘑菇&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;大家的分享也讓我很有感觸，我們在線上交流，好像圍坐成一圈，這展示着不僅屬於人的圈子的纏繞，而是像怡寧所説的，不同世界和不同關係之間在一起聚合。現在「多物種（multi-species）」的話題非常熱，我在想，與其去糾結「不以人為中心」的概念，其實看一看我們身邊的這些遭遇本身就是由不斷的、不同的關係、不同的能量、不同的偶然而耦合起來的過程。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我想講一個故事。我的性格是比較外向型的，常常會不由自主地表達自己的觀點和情緒，但我的缺點是偶爾會不善於抓住別人的想法，但我身邊許多要好的朋友都是內向的。我有一個非常好朋友某天在微信羣裏很驚喜地分享，説他的洗臉池下水道里長了幾個蘑菇。我當時第一反應就是，好惡心啊，怎麼長了蘑菇還這麼開心呢？他就跟我説：像我們平時在外跟其他人的關係中不太善於表露自己的人，會注意到小的植物不斷生長的過程，讓我覺得特別療愈。這位朋友的話讓我覺得特別有意思，我也開始學着觀察類似蘑菇之類的小生命，因為我想知道我這位朋友的體驗是怎麼樣的。雖然我不能説我現在能完全理解這種體驗，但我想説的是，&lt;strong&gt;關懷本身是一個學習的過程，是一個能 get 到他人的體驗、是看見他人的過程。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;另外一方面，諷刺的是，我們所經歷的過去這幾年對於我和我身邊熟悉的一些夥伴來説從多個層面上都充滿了「祛魅感」，是一個對諸多話語深感破產（disenfranchised）的時期。當我得知要分享「關懷 care」這個話題的時候，我笑了，因為似乎大家這一兩年説的最多的話反而是「我不 care」！我相信很多朋友也有同感——關係破裂我不 care，面臨各種或公共或私人的危機我也不 care，儘管我們面對憤怒和沮喪，我只能關照好我自己，大不了去泡個澡吃吃喝喝就好了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我們遭遇着信仰的崩塌和同溫層的破裂……一方面我們面臨的是一個越發不穩定的社會，危機變成常態的日常生活，關係和信任不斷在被表演和策略給商品化的狀況當中，一方面又需要重新去思考超越不斷被個體化的關切與關懷問題。我們面對的似乎不是「我們要或者不要關懷」的問題，而是「我們怎麼去關懷」的問題，從一個是或不是的對立答案回到「關懷」到底意味着什麼的再思考中。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在我們經歷了過去危機感不穩定感達到高潮的懸置狀況後，大家可能慢慢地意識到這種所謂的反思，所謂的批判的表演對於當下的我們來説愈發不具有生產性。我想到十幾年前，知名社會理論家拉圖爾（Bruno Latour）曾在一篇文章中拷問：批判是不是已經到了彈盡糧絕的時候？（Has Critique Run Out of Steam?）他指出，我們作為社會批評家或者希求讓社會變好的思考者，能否設計出另一種更強有力的描述性工具來闡述關切，且這種工具的意義不再是揭穿真相，而是像女性主義學者唐納·哈拉維（Donna haraway）所説的，回到保護和關心他人的本質；有沒有可能在事實的描述中增加現實感，而不是減少現實感，儘管後者來自我們內心深處的批判精神和衝動？拉圖爾想表達的道理其實很簡單——&lt;strong&gt;我們需要停下來環繞四周，感受大地，而不是俯瞰眾生。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我自己的觀察和實踐都集中在城市社區中。「俯瞰眾生」在我的研究中其實非常常見。城市和社區的層面，每當涉及某些與基礎設施或土地密切關聯的資源時，「關懷」會作為一種謀取這些資源的工具被不斷地提及。然而，往往這種展現方式是通過某些機構化的機制將「關懷」規模化（scaled up）——比如成立一個組織，向政府拿錢，為了關懷的名義不斷向上擴張向上撐起一個符號化的閉環。還有一種「關懷」通過社羣的機構化呈現，比如志同道合的青年人組成社羣，往往會為了獲得社會的認可去複製一系列既有的機構模式並內化到社羣的架構當中，需要制定一系列象徵性的規章制度來框限原本「一起玩」而產生的實踐。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我覺得&lt;strong&gt;這兩種是我們應該反思的關懷路徑——通過規模（scaled）和機構（institutionalized）的模式來實現或滿足某種關切的使命。&lt;/strong&gt;小到團體，大到國家的維度，用條框的定勢思維去審視關懷本身。這種關懷成為維持某種形式性結構的符號，我們已經在日常生活中意識到相關問題，卻持續反覆框限於這種模式——簡單來説，這種口號的「關懷」，是「我們需要去 care」，「我們為了 care，一定要找到某種解決方式」類似的迷戀，為了不斷向上層力量拿錢拿資源而進行的自我營銷，等等……不管是通過什麼方式，這種「關懷」思路很容易再生產出另一種包袱。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;彬華和艾雯分享的設計理念和新的思路可以提供新的啓發。關懷一方面可能會無形或有意地變成另外一種社會控制，但另外一方面也能在不斷看似混亂的拉扯和互惠的過程當中，讓這些關懷的陷阱變得可見。通過試驗性的探索去不斷地試錯，而不是一蹴而就地搭建條條框框的形式來處理關懷。也就是説，關懷變成了一種很流動的，像怡寧所説的，能夠被抓取的，柔軟的實踐。這也很符合女性主義的關懷態度。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;彬華和艾雯所分享的觀點，突顯關懷需要維護和修補（maintenance）。如果不把關懷變成一種自我剝削的工具的話，它怎麼成為一種有益的勞動來實現拉扯和互惠？以上幾位夥伴的討論展現了這個面向。&lt;strong&gt;另一種關懷的面向將關懷想象成一種纏繞着的、具有關係性的力，這樣的「care」既以人作為一個參照點，但又不把人作為絕對的中心，像是我前面提到的「蘑菇式」的關懷，慢慢學會看到微小的事物以及其中所潛藏的可能性。&lt;/strong&gt;這是我剛剛在大家的分享中看到的最有啓發的兩種關懷的風格。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;觀眾討論&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;曹書韻：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;謝謝各位夥伴美妙的分享。我補充一些自己在準備這場關於「關懷」的圓桌論壇時內心的張力。最近工作非常忙，很想慢慢地、紮實地準備今天的討論，但又感到心力還不夠，我隱隱約約想着，首先應該從自我關懷做起，「知行合一」地策劃這場交流。如果用一種自我耗竭的方式去「表演」一場關懷的話語，好像完全違背了初衷。我很慶幸從自身的需要出發，發出了邀請，即使是在線上都能感受到大家如此強的能量場。在策劃時我有在想是否要從一個冥想開始，但又感覺自己還沒有準備好，特別謝謝怡寧用一種美妙的引導帶我們一起回到身體的當下。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;殷艾雯：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;怡寧的分享講述了非常的美妙的體驗！她提到先試着感受單腳站在地上那種獨立難支撐的感覺，再到後面感受大地的托起，這種視角的不斷轉換給了我很大啓發，包括後面描述如何背起一個人的情景，&lt;strong&gt;實際上並不是單純要背起一個人，而是互相擁抱。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在前面的分享中我花了很長時間討論公憤和私憤。在怡寧的講述中，我突然意識到，&lt;strong&gt;公憤和私憤之間只差一個轉身&lt;/strong&gt;。當你把頭轉向私憤時，你的身後就是公憤。這只是一個轉身的問題。我覺得她提示了一個非常關鍵的點，那就是&lt;strong&gt;你能夠擁有這個轉身的可能&lt;/strong&gt;。首先，你要意識到自己的存在，意識到自己是宇宙的一部分——只有當你明白自己並不是獨立的存在，也不僅是在背起他人，你才可能實現這個轉身。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我有一個學生，她有非常傳統的設計教育背景，在過去的兩年裏，她一直在做關懷系統的設計，調研了很多養老院。她一直非常困惑痛苦，無法認同自己的設計，我告訴她，「你的眼界太高太遠了。如果你的關懷只停留在空中，將那些你想關懷的人視作抽象的用戶，那麼你真正的關懷在哪裏呢？」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這兩個月，她突然做出了「轉身」。她説，我想和我的外婆一起設計。她之所以想做這一設計，是因為她認為她的外婆在養老院裏受到了不公平的對待，她覺得外婆無法獲得她所定義的「良好的老年生活」，但她一直不願意承認這一事實。甚至有段時間，她完全不提及這個原因，因為覺得這會讓她的設計失去正當性。在終於承認這個事實後，她仍然質疑，「你逼我説出這個原因了，那又怎樣呢？這會讓我的設計更能夠為大眾負責嗎？不可能，我要做的是系統性的變革！」然後她「轉身」了。她説，「好，我願意接受你的批評，我去和我的外婆談這件事情，我想要和她一起去做。」昨天在評估會上，她第一次講述了這兩個月內的所做所思，她和外婆長時間討論，還沒有做出具體的東西，突然間外婆對她説，「你知道嗎？你這樣和我説，讓我第一次覺得我還是有用的人，我不僅僅是一個被關心的人，我可以通過你的關懷來關心這個社會。」她哭了，「做那麼多設計，只有這個我覺得‘有用’。真正的有用就在身邊。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我覺得這個故事有些迴應到怡寧説的「我揹負你，而你也在擁抱我。」&lt;strong&gt;我們再看看關懷者與被關懷者的關係，被關懷者的存在不應為了迎合你去證明自己是那種有能力去托起別人的那個人，Ta 在被關懷的同時也在關懷你。&lt;/strong&gt;我們可以察覺到 ta 們給予我們的關懷嗎？（如果可以，如果我們明白 ta 們在關懷的關係中的主動給予）我們可以把 ta 們從被動的位置中放出來嗎？這隻差我們自己的一個轉身。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;觀眾 1：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;如果很多結構性問題出於地域不平等的發展，很多的行動可能只能在一線城市成立，那麼地方城市呢，類似於四線城市或者縣城，鄉鎮？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;殷艾雯：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;行動不能被視為固定的配方，而是需要根據不同的環境來進行調整。如果你在設計一項行動時，意識到它在一線城市的環境中非常有效，那麼當你回到或前往四線城市、鄉村或縣城時，是否可以找到不同的方法來激勵人們？是否可以以類似的在地關懷的方式重新設想與當地人聯繫的方式，並逐步建立起與大城市及周邊城市的聯繫？這是一個更廣闊的視角，也就是説，我們不應該將行動想象成一個單一的產品，用一種固定的配方在不同地方推廣。實際上，關懷並沒有一種適用於所有情況的配方，每個人、每段關係和每個世界都是獨特的。我們能否懷着這樣的關懷走進彼此的聯繫中呢？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;張煒侖：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我們剛才討論的關懷是一種情境化的實踐，它深深嵌入在特定的框架或語境中。然而，這並不意味着我們可以或多或少地忽視那些存在於大型結構性問題中、以不同形式呈現的壓迫。因此，我們既要意識到這些大型形式上的壓迫，又要環顧自身周圍，無論是在縣城還是一線城市，看看周圍存在哪些小型關懷。這並不是採用口號式的運動方式來尋找解決方案，而是要深入這些解決方案的源頭，並汲取其養分的地方往往是一些被忽視或被很少人察覺的情境。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;趙伊人：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我來讀一段話，這是我寫的一個關於「邊界」的詞條，來自我們做過的一個展覽項目《辭海遊戲》（書韻發起、黃奕編輯）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在與一些因政治立場和社會關懷而互動的個人和社羣交往過程中，我深刻體會到個人與他人能夠改變社會的殷切希望之間存在巨大的張力。曾經為了填補這種張力而犧牲了自己的興趣和精力，但我個人感受到了極大的不適，比如被利用、被誇大其詞地吹捧、被耗盡精力以及被貼上反動的標籤，還有被僵化地看待和寄予過高的期望。我深刻認識到個人的渺小和社會持續糟糕的現狀。後來，我慢慢學會適應這種張力，甚至偶爾「play with it」。我提醒自己不能變得悲觀，也不能不顧一切，而是要仔細權衡每個值得考慮的具體交往情境。同時，我也深刻認識到&lt;strong&gt;每個人都需要被視為獨特的個體，所以我只能做一些微小的事情，與少數人交往，這樣才能讓我作為一個人真正被看見、被理解和被尊重。這種生活實踐一定有其界限，不能因為懷有普世的關懷而無法劃定邊界，試圖惠及所有人。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;觀眾 2：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;感覺一些社區營造好像也是一種關懷錶演的高潮，但年輕人又在動盪的社會急需尋找下值支點，於是可以有利於快速進行關懷生產的實踐項目組織成了大家的首選。然而，這種快捷的路徑會讓人在回過神來時感到新的無力。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;殷艾雯：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一個更加成就導向的社會常常會混淆世俗的成就感和歸屬感，我們會認為一旦獲得了被世俗價值所認可，我們就有了歸屬感，就能夠被接納。然而，實際上在研究的時候會發現，這是有問題的。一種所謂的「附近歸屬感」是如何與身邊的人建立聯繫，如何找到自己的社羣。當你感受到被具體的人托起後，再去尋找成就感，就可以逐漸剝離私憤和公憤之間微妙的邊界。因為當你的私人憤怒得到具體的支持後得到一定的療愈，當你尋找成就感時，你就會意識到自己追求的是與社會的連接，而不是一些難以言説的個人療愈。&lt;strong&gt;在這個成就感和歸屬感不斷相互滋養的過程中，我們作為個體獲得了更廣闊的成長空間&lt;/strong&gt;，我們就可以進入所謂的「廣泛歸屬感」，即願意無私地接納自己是宇宙的一部分，我們可以托起地球，地球也可以托起我們。因此，社區裏的年輕人非常需要這種價值觀念，以便進入社羣建設中的「關懷錶演」。然而，我們不一定能找不到附近可以支撐我們的人，無法進入個人療愈的狀態，因此不得不通過追求成就感來尋找歸屬感。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我們當然可以批判社區營造在某種程度上把關懷變成了一種表演或產品，成了不斷強化資本主義的過程。但是，如果我們想在其中尋找突破點，根據我們的研究，建議大家&lt;strong&gt;首先在周圍建立自己的關懷網絡，讓自己可以被支持，同時也托起別人。&lt;/strong&gt;在這個過程中，你將不再混淆成就感和你所需要的歸屬感，擺脫這種不斷重複生產的無力感。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;陳怡寧：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;曾經讓我非常困擾的問題是，我們與批判理論和左翼思想之間的關係是怎樣的。當我們瞭解宏大理論分析的結構性問題，以及有可能的新出路時，它們對我們來説意味着什麼。很多時候，左翼行動一再陷入一個陷阱，即理論支持往往會被轉化為一種新的行動綱領和藍圖，理論和理論者居於不必要的高位。如何區分信仰和信任，是我們需要在實踐中需要時時關注的。也許可以把理論或者某種關懷模式當成自己身邊的同伴，在具體的實踐中，通過身體的體驗和感受去與 ta 交流，尋找和 ta 的映射與連接，沒有也不必太在意。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;關於「關懷匯流」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在第四屆倫敦設計雙年展 (London Design Biennale) 「Remapping Collaboration」的主題框架下，CARE 主題館 (Care Pavilion) 通過一系列全新委任項目對關懷議題展開探索：思辨關懷由人類和非人類表達和承載的多種形態，體認其中錯綜複雜的意涵。15 位享譽國際亦深耕在地的傑出創作者共同對這個一直存在但又愈加緊迫的議題做出迴應，由此生髮的實踐旨在超越隔離與停滯，重新編織與彼此、與世界、與萬物原本被掩蓋的關係。項目以冥想、儀式、表演、出版、圓桌等形式進行，並以《Care Manifesto》匯聚全球設計師、建築師、思想家和行動者的關懷宣言。2023 年倫敦設計雙年展 CARE 主題館由宋濤擔任總策劃，由王乃一擔任策展人，雅娜·舒爾茨 (Jana Scholze) 擔任學術顧問，李思蔚擔任展覽總監，並得到了信言設計大使專題資助計劃 (Design Trust Feature Grant) 支持。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在倫敦設計雙年展閉幕當天，&amp;nbsp;「關懷匯流」計劃正式啓動，希冀創造多個共同在場的時刻，通過多學科視野與個體經驗的共振，重新構想關懷的政治、倫理與潛能。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;最新文章（持續更新）&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol

            <title>微故事: 她她時光機 (東加豆)</title>
            <description>&lt;h2&gt;微故事: 她她時光機 (東加豆)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9db6bd0a-f0de-45b5-9049-b8aa8660e2ac.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;在香港 1980 年代有一齣動畫片集叫｛叮噹｝。那時，沒有人認識誰｛多拉 A 夢｝。｛叮噹｝最能夠得到孩子歡心的，就是他百寶袋裡的東西。不不，不僅是孩子，他也得到大人的歡心。尤其他的｛隨意門｝和｛時光機｝這兩件東西，幾乎時刻都入前五名人們最渴望百寶袋裡的東西。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛隨意門｝曾經是｛阿冰｝最想要的，也許是她的性格問題，｛逃避｝事情永遠是她最快選擇的做法，所以，｛隨意門｝是最適合她的，只要心中想著要去的地方，打開隨意門馬上就去了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;比如：阿冰看見父親和丈夫的火藥味正在發酵中，阿冰打開隨意門就可能離開這個火境之地。又或者阿冰給老闆罵得頭昏腦脹，只要隨意門打開，馬上又可以逃離壓力之區。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，數十年輕輕就過去了，逃避往往不是她的想象，逃避和拖延是互相緊扣，糟糕的事情並沒有消失，還是要面對的，不然，可能變得更慘。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;現在的阿冰，她最想要的是一部｛時光機｝。因為阿冰和她的母親｛秀婆婆｝之間的關係漸漸變得陌生和疏遠。阿冰要兼顧自己的家庭、工作以及她的健康，在種種的生活壓力下，漸漸忽略了和媽媽之間的溝通，甚至開始對她產生了一些抱怨。秀婆婆則因為年老體衰，對阿冰的態度變得苛刻和冷漠。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;眼見媽媽日漸衰老，阿冰心情哀嘆，而且兩人的代溝好像越來越重，阿冰心更無奈。沒分對或錯，阿冰知道自己變了， 母親從來沒變過，也許，問題就是她從來沒有變過，沒有變過也許都是錯。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;吵鬧經已是常態，衝突時常有，表達不該有的態度，説出不該説的話，總之，關係破裂，情況嚴重得無法收拾的地步，阿冰陷入了一種混亂和矛盾的情緒中。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一天，家族傳來了一個震撼的消息，秀婆婆突然宣佈要斷絕和阿冰的母女關係。這樣的舉動讓所有親友都感到震驚和難以置信，因為阿冰向來是一個孝順的女兒，大家也覺得她們的關係很親密。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這件事，只有秀婆婆和阿冰兩個人知道。因為，阿冰發現了｛時光機）！她不僅是知道，她親身經歷過。就在二人這樣緊張的關係時刻，阿冰突然想到了一個解決的辦法...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;時光機！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;她把一切告訴了秀婆婆，關於時光機的一切，時光機可以帶她們時光倒流，回到 1955 年，那時秀婆婆還是十五歲，阿冰要和秀婆婆交個朋友，而不是母女。因為，如果有血緣關係，時光機牽涉的事情會變得相當複雜，可能會造成大錯特錯。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;秀婆婆看過一齣電影叫｛難兄難弟｝，是一對父子的故事，兒子回到了父親的年代，最終他成為了他父親的朋友，故事很感人，想不到夢幻是可以實現，而且會發生在自己身上。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;最終，她們決定一同使用時光機。秀婆婆決定回到十五歲。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;秀婆婆看到眼前的時光機，它長達 2.2 公尺、寬 1.6 公尺、高 1.28 公尺，重達 538 公斤。秀婆婆喃喃自語，她不會後悔的，因為，她已經老得這樣，除了七十歲以上的人，沒有人再會明白她的心情和需要！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在時光機｛卡｝一聲的啟動聲中，阿冰和秀婆婆一瞬間就返回去 1955 年的世界。這一次，她們不再是母女，而是彼此平等的女孩，兩個十五歲的人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，奇怪的事發生了。阿冰清楚知道自己是誰，清楚事情的發生，清楚看到面前的秀婆婆，不不，是｛阿秀｝，自己的媽媽！。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而｛阿秀｝卻什麼也不知道，她只覺得阿冰很面善，而且很友善，這個女孩似曾相識，可能曾經是同學，也許是鄰居，或者幫過她，總之，一下子她們就成了一對好朋友，從頭開始，沒有束縛，沒有期待。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在這段時間裡，阿冰終於看到了一個年輕、充滿活力的母親，這個情景她想象過數百次。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;她們一起逛街、看電影、聊心事。阿冰發現，阿秀的個性和她想像中完全不同。她聰明、善良、勇敢，對生活充滿熱情。在阿秀身上根本不會看到嘮叨或抱怨什麼，她們手挽手穿過大街小巷，一起笑、一起玩、一起哭，一起度過了那些被遺忘的時光。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿冰要做一個聆聽者，她很想聆聽阿秀每一句話。而阿秀彷彿對阿冰有無限的信任，她向阿冰説了很多童年的往事，以後想做的事，十八歲要做什麼，廿八歲要做什麼，三十八歲要做什麼，四十八歲要做什麼，噢！四十八歲似乎太老了！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;她不想生孩子，因為阿秀的媽媽説，孩子將來一定會嫌棄她的！意思是，阿秀一定會嫌棄她的媽媽又老又醜。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿秀只是剛剛出來工作，想不了那麼多，總之，阿秀的媽媽就是這樣説。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿冰喃喃自語：啊！原來外婆説過這些話。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，隨著時間的推移，阿冰開始意識到，即使沒有血緣的枷鎖，人與人之間的關係依然複雜。阿冰和阿秀開始有了分歧，有了衝突。阿冰終於明白，問題並不在於是否為母女，而在於人與人之間的理解與包容。阿冰一直認為秀婆婆不理解她，不包容她，但是，她自己呢？她對秀婆婆呢？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿冰意識到，衰老不過是生命旅途中的一站，無奈也是時間無情的烙印。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;當時光機一再啟動，將她們帶回現實的時候，奇怪的事情又發生了。秀婆婆完全記得時光機以後的事情，面前的阿冰彷彿有了雙重關係。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;兩人的情感得到了重新建立，彼此更加理解和尊重對方，珍惜彼此的存在。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;時光機不僅讓她們經歷了一次時空的奇遇，更是一次心靈的旅程和革命。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;完!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;寫作日期：2024 年 3 月 19 日&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;開始時間 : 13:16pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;完成時間 : 16:34pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;圖.文. 東加豆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我除了寫微故事，還製作有聲書，希望我們能互相認識。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;喜歡我的文章嗎？盼得到您的支持、點讚，或分享我的文章，讓我知道創作的路上有你陪伴。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;關於我：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://tonkabean.me/&quot;&gt;https://tonkabean.me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>與何清漣女士商榷：特朗普與拜登政治底色的辨誤</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;《聯合早報》3 月 12 日刊登了何清漣女士的文章《誰希望拜登連任美國總統》。在文中，何女士認為，拜登得到了美國「社會主義者」等左翼人士的強力支持，民主黨人及拜登政府的政策還撕裂了美國社會。而同時，何女士對特朗普及共和黨人的政策主張多有同情和理解，對其爭議言行頗多辯護之詞。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;筆者與何女士的觀點甚為不同。一方面是因為筆者是中左翼立場人士，與何女士右翼價值觀存在差異。更重要的是，筆者認為，何女士文章中的事實判斷即存在頗多訛誤，邏輯上也有矛盾。筆者希望在本文中加以釐清和商榷。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;首先，何女士提到，普京聲稱拜登當選總統更利於俄羅斯。而如今俄羅斯入侵烏克蘭，普京政權名聲大壞。何女士提及此事，似是要表明拜登和壞人普京是同一方的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這並非事實。恰恰相反，是特朗普和部分共和黨人與普京政權親近，並受其支持，而非拜登等民主黨人。美國聯邦調查局（FBI）等官方機構、諸多知名媒體，均證實了 2016 年俄羅斯干預了美國大選。普京政權通過製造假新聞等方式，助力了特朗普擊敗民主黨人希拉里。而普京和特朗普之間，也多次相互稱讚。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;俄烏戰爭爆發後，特朗普在公開場合多次宣稱，他反對對烏克蘭的援助，並暗示要烏克蘭割讓土地換取和平。許多共和黨人也激烈反對援助烏克蘭，還在國會阻擊援烏法案的通過。而相反，自俄烏戰爭爆發以來，拜登明確支持烏克蘭抵抗俄羅斯，力推援烏法案。拜登政府聯合盟國對烏克蘭的堅定支持，是烏克蘭迄今沒有被俄羅斯擊敗的最重要原因。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;根據這些信息，普京實際上青睞的是特朗普及共和黨人，而非拜登與民主黨。至於普京在最近採訪時希望拜登當選，自然是一種迷惑輿論的謊言。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;第二，何女士關於美國的西方盟國厭惡特朗普、冀望拜登獲勝的敍述，是正確的事實。但對此評析時，何女士卻認為這是北約盟國自私，把特朗普試圖叛賣盟友的行為輕描淡寫為「小氣」，以及以美國國內經濟民生問題，為特朗普拒絕承擔同盟義務辯護。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這樣的説辭，弱化了北約（及類似的基於普世人權的同盟）互助合作的重要性，淡化了特朗普政策主張對維繫同盟的破壞力。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;北約雖然有着種種問題，但在如今國際形勢日益緊張的狀態下，仍然扮演着非常重要且正面的角色。無論對於打擊恐怖主義、遏制俄羅斯侵略、保護成員國安全，都不可或缺。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;作為世界最強國、北約領頭羊、國際秩序主導者，美國自然應當承擔最大責任。這不僅是美國須為的義務，也是利於美國長遠利益的應為之事。美國之所以繁榮強大，並非依靠孤立主義和閉關自守，而是深深參與並主導國際秩序，並促成國家利益與國際共同利益的一致，所造就的結果。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;無論二戰中美國領導反法西斯陣營勝利，還是戰後至今推動全球化，美國自身都是最大受益者。如果美國放棄對國際事務的積極參與，只會導致美國的沒落。沒落的美國，在國債、國民養老、國家安全等方面只會比現在更差，而非更好。「皮之不存，毛將焉附」，缺乏盟友支持甚至退出北約的美國，也將更加遭遇威權和極端勢力的挑戰。美國如果放棄維護國際秩序，讓世界陷入叢林，美國自身想做「與世無爭」的「世外桃源」也是不得的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;顯然，特朗普及部分共和黨人為了短期經濟利益和節省一些援外經費，而放棄全局和整體的巨大利益，是狹隘和短視的。或許這利於其個人和黨派的利益，但對美國國家和人民是得不償失的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;第三，何女士説，拜登支持者主要是「社會主義者」。這是以偏概全的。而何女士對於拜登和民主黨「撕裂美國」的批判，也是以誇大的態度和選擇性的方式敍述分析，是混淆了美國複雜政治現實的謬誤言論。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;美國青年一代確實有不少人對「社會主義」頗有好感，但第一，這僅限於佔美國人少數的青年人；第二，對社會主義有好感，並非就是社會主義者。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;相較於歐洲和加拿大等國，美國政治光譜整體上更加右傾，即便大多數民主黨人也更多是自由主義者。左翼政治家、參議員桑德斯，也只是社會民主主義者，而非社會主義者。只有眾議院議員亞歷山德莉婭·科爾特斯（AOC）這樣極少數政治人物算是社會主義者。民主黨成員絕大多數都是非社會主義者，只是相對共和黨，他們較傾向於大政府、更重視國家幹預和社會保障。但根本上當然還是支持自由主義的，而非支持高度集體主義式的蘇式社會主義。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而拜登更不屬於社會主義者，而是較為中道理性的政治家。一些美國極左人士，包括社會主義者，還因為拜登不夠左傾，在勞工、女權、加沙問題上沒有足夠支持弱勢，而抵制拜登，呼籲不要在 2024 年大選中投票給他。這些人在 2016 年大選中也抵制投給希拉里，這些「關鍵少數」放棄投票，間接造成希拉里的敗選。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;何女士還認為，美國民主黨正在發動「顏色革命」，改變美國青年人政治立場，讓他們成為社會主義者，並演變美國為社會主義國家。這並非事實。美國是一個自由開放的國家，並沒有極權專制國家的洗腦和強制，每個人都可以自由選擇信仰、自我篩選信息，民主黨沒有能力決定國民的政治取向。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而美國大學及媒體之所以普遍左傾，是因為他們更為的瞭解歷史、現實，有更豐富的人文知識和廣闊的視野、更強的社科分析能力和判斷力，也更傾向扶助弱勢。他們的價值判斷和主張，是基於事實和良知做出的選擇，並非是出於私利或捏造事實而刻意塑造的特定立場。就像「1+1＝2」被絕大多數人認可，是因為 1+1＝2 確實是對的，而非是洗腦後的判斷。何況，美國主流媒體中，也有華爾街日報等中間派媒體、福克斯等保守派媒體，而並非由左傾者壟斷。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而就何女士所説的「無、知、少、女」羣體，她們大多數是社會的相對受害者、邊緣羣體，支持傾向變革、平權、社會公正的民主黨，是無可厚非的。雖然過激的變革和平權、過分的「政治正確」是不合適的、不顧現實條件的、應節制和漸進的；但扶助弱勢、促進平等、建設多元和包容社會的基本訴求和方向，是正確的、應理解與支持的。不能因為少數激進分子的偏激行為，而對她們一概否定。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;更重要的是，真正促使美國撕裂的，正是特朗普和許多共和黨人。特朗普及共和黨人鼓吹或實際奉行的白人至上/白人優先主義、基督教原教旨主義、種族主義和極端民族主義立場和政策，以及對女性、LGBT、少數族裔、外來移民等羣體的強烈排斥，對這些弱勢羣體權利運動的攻擊，加劇了社會矛盾與仇恨、破壞了美國的包容與多樣性，促使美國政治的極化與對立。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;特朗普與共和黨人還不顧慣例，強行推舉和任命卡瓦諾、巴雷特等保守派大法官，破壞政治平衡。特朗普還長期發表對奧巴馬、希拉里、拜登等人的侮辱、謠言、陰謀論等誹謗言論。而 2020 年大選結果揭曉後，特朗普和一些共和黨人還拒絕承認選舉結果、製造「1.6」騷亂。而特朗普做出這些言行，許多共和黨人仍然支持他，才是「不惜代價（也要將特朗普）選成總統」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這些顯而易見的事實都證明，特朗普與部分共和黨人，才是造成美國社會撕裂的主要責任人。即便民主黨激進分子也有責任，也是次要的，且並不能代表民主黨主流。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;另外，何女士在文中，還有若干邏輯不自洽的矛盾之處、對引用內容的曲解，以及無的放矢的批評。例如，何女士因《紐約時報》對特朗普的態度，而認為《紐約時報》破壞規則，不可信任；卻又在本文中多次引用《紐約時報》的若干民調來反映拜登支持率低、「不得人心」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;何女士借用左派主持人克里斯·華萊士的話「很多媒體機構認為對特朗普報道不用再遵循新聞頁一般規則和客觀性」，來「證明」媒體對特朗普報道不客觀。而事實是，因為特朗普撒謊太多、有大量超出常規的言行，所以無法按照對待正常的守信的政治家方式，對其言行加以評論和檢驗，而只能針對其獨特性格和言論「特事特辦」，包括不再對其荒誕不經言論當做正經話一一反駁。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這並非是主流媒體不再遵循規則和客觀。就像媒體評價普京政權對入侵烏克蘭的各種辯護之詞，如「烏克蘭國家並不存在」、「俄羅斯從不侵略別國」、「澤連斯基才是戰犯」等讕言，難道還有必要每次都假定這些話可信而再去分析、而不直接否定嗎？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;何女士一邊渲染美國社會主義者的增長和威脅，認為是「社會主義者」推選拜登上位，一邊又説許多選民正在離拜登而去。那麼究竟美國「社會主義者」是強大還是虛弱呢？美國也確實有少數社會主義者或其他極左人士，而如前所述，這些人反而因拜登不夠左傾而抵制拜登，這些「關鍵少數」拒絕支持拜登，正是拜登民調落後特朗普的重要原因。而何女士卻暗示，拜登是因為左傾而失去支持、特朗普更得民心。這又是不符事實的。美國社會主義者不是多數（但是關鍵少數），拜登並非左傾（而是相對中道），特朗普也並非更得民心（只是相對於民主黨人內部的撕裂，特朗普支持者比較團結和堅定）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;何女士指責拜登「若干內政外交舉措」導致美國撕裂，卻並沒有指出舉措內容和具體影響。而據筆者所知，拜登政策較為平和，是儘可能彌合社會裂痕的。無論在女權和 LGBT 權利等弱勢羣體權利問題、邊境難民入境問題、巴以問題，都儘可能以較平衡和模糊策略處置，不偏幫一方。雖然這也會導致「兩邊不討好（最近拜登民調下滑正是與此有關）」，但也反映了拜登希望儘可能以折中策略解決問題、兼顧各方關切的中庸態度。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;拜登這些政策，與特朗普「一邊倒」反難民、反女權、支持以色列的偏激保守政策迥然不同，也比奧巴馬、希拉里等進步派激烈推進女權、LGBT 權利、移民融入、支持巴勒斯坦較快建國等進步政策更為和緩。所以説拜登加劇分裂，是對事實的認知錯誤。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;總之，筆者認為，何女士對於美國政局及總統競選的看法，是偏頗的、不盡真實的、存在種種謬誤的。何女士還選擇性的闡述事實，放大拜登和民主黨的不足，而為特朗普和共和黨的不良行徑辯護緩頰。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;筆者難以認同何女士的説辭，才特地寫出本文以駁。誠然，筆者是中左翼，不贊同何女士確實有價值觀因素。但除了立場差別，筆者也認為何女士所説有不少事實上的訛誤。無論立場如何，對於一些基本事實不應否認或修改。而且，既然有何女士這樣基於右翼立場、特朗普支持者的文章，筆者也就以中左翼的民主黨支持者作文以應，亦是合情合理之義。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;（本文刪減版已發表於《聯合早報》，封面圖片取自半島電視台）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>論語漫讀（35）：何為則民服？ — 孔子主要就是教如何維護統治</title>

            <title>馬克·費舍：一無是處</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;一無是處&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;馬克·費舍/文&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;王立秋/譯&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;本文最初發表於費舍的博客&lt;strong&gt;k-punk&lt;/strong&gt;,也刊載於&lt;strong&gt;The Occupied Times&lt;/strong&gt;, March 19, 2014。按 CC-NC-SA 協議譯介。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;自青少年時期起，我就斷斷續續地苦於抑鬱。有時，抑鬱的發作會讓人極度虛弱——它會讓人自殘、退縮（我會躲在自己房間裏一待就是幾個月，只有在需要簽到或購買維持生命所必需的食物時才會冒險出去），會讓人不得不在精神科病房蹉跎一段時光。我不敢説自己已經從那種情況中恢復過來了，但我樂意説，近年來，我抑鬱發作的頻率和嚴重程度都大大降低了。這部分是因為我的生活處境發生了變化，但也和我對自己的抑鬱及其原因有了不同的認識有關。我把自己精神痛苦的經歷拿出來説，不是因為我認為它們有什麼特別或獨一無二的地方，而是為了支撐這樣一個主張，即我們最好通過非個人的、「政治的」而不是個體的、「心理的」框架來理解多種形式的抑鬱並與之鬥爭。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;寫自己的抑鬱是一件困難的事。抑鬱在一定程度上是由一個「內在的」譏諷聲音構成的，這個聲音會指責你自我放縱——你才沒有抑鬱呢，你只是在自悲自憐，快振作起來——而公開這一狀況本身就可能觸發這個聲音。當然，這個聲音根本就不是「內在的」——它是實際社會力量的內化表達，而否認抑鬱與政治相關，是符合其中一些社會力量的既得利益的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一直以來，我的抑鬱都和這樣一個信念分不開，那就是，我相信自己真的一無是處。在三十歲以前的大部分時間裏，我都相信自己永遠不會工作了。在二十幾歲的時候，我在讀研、間歇性的失業和臨時性的工作之間徘徊。在承擔這些角色中的每一個的時候，我都覺得自己不屬於那個身份——在讀研的時候，我覺得自己是一路靠裝矇混過關的半吊子，而不是真正的學者；在失業的時候，我覺得自己並不是真的失業，和那些誠實求職的人不一樣，我只是在偷懶罷了；在短暫就業的時候，我覺得自己不稱職，並且無論如何我都不是真的屬於這些辦公室或工廠的工作崗位，不是因為我對這些崗位來説「太優秀了」，而是——恰恰相反——因為我學歷過高、百無一用，搶了比我更需要、更應該得到這份工作的人的飯碗。甚至當我在精神病房的時候，我也覺得自己不是真的抑鬱——我只是在為了逃避工作而裝抑鬱，或者按抑鬱極其矛盾的邏輯來説，我只是在為了隱瞞我沒有能力工作、社會中根本就沒有我的位置這個事實而裝抑鬱而已。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;當我最終在延續教育學院找到一份講師工作的時候，我一度欣喜不已——但就其本質而言，這個欣喜恰恰表明，我還沒有擺脫一無是處的感覺，而不久之後，這種感覺又使我陷入了更長時間的抑鬱。我缺乏那種「天生我材」的冷靜自信。在某個並不潛藏的層面上，我顯然依然相信自己不是那種能夠勝任教學工作的人。可這種信念從何而來？主流的精神病學認為，這樣的「信念」源於大腦化學機制的功能失調，可以通過藥物來加以糾正；眾所周知，精神分析和受其影響的各種療法到家庭背景中去尋找精神痛苦的根源，而認知行為療法則不那麼對定位消極信念的來源感興趣，它只想用一套積極的故事來取代它們。倒不是説這些模型全錯了，而是説，它們沒有把握到也必然把握不到這種自卑感最可能的原因：社會力量。對我影響最大的社會力量是階級的力量，不過當然了，性別、種族和其他形式的壓迫也會通過生產同樣的自卑感——即認為自己「在本體上」、自己的「存在」本身低人一等——起作用。這種自卑感最好的表達，就是我在上面説明的那種想法，即認為自己不是那種能夠勝任被指定給主流羣體的角色的人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在我的書《資本主義現實主義》的一位讀者的敦促下，我開始研究大衞·斯梅爾 (David Smail) 的作品。斯梅爾是一名治療師，但他把權力問題放到了治療的中心。他證實了我摸索到的那些關於抑鬱的假設。在他的重要著作《苦惱的起源》(&lt;strong&gt;The Origins of Unhappiness&lt;/strong&gt;)，斯梅爾描述了階級的印記怎樣被設計為不可磨滅的。對於那些從一出生就在接受這樣的教育——「你就是低人一等」——的人來説，獲得資歷或財富並不足以消除他們自己心中或他人心中的那種在生命初期就已經烙在他們身上的原始的無價值感。一個走出自己「本應」佔據的社會領域的人總是面臨着被眩暈、恐慌和恐懼感壓倒的危險：「……被孤立，被斷聯，被充滿敵意的空間包圍，你突然就沒了聯繫，沒了穩定，沒了支撐；一種令人眩暈、讓你厭惡的不確定佔據了你；一種徹底失去身份（的感覺）、一種徹底徹尾的欺詐感威脅着你；你沒有權利在此時、此刻住在這個身體裏，穿這樣的衣服；你什麼也不是，而確切來説，‘什麼也不是’正是你覺得自己正在變成的那個東西。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一段時間以來，統治階級最成功的策略之一就是「責任化」(responsibilisation)。這種策略鼓勵底層階級的每個個體成員認為他們自己的貧困、缺乏計劃或失業是他們自己的錯並且只是他們自己的錯。個體會怪自己而不怪社會結構，無論如何，統治階級都會誘導他們相信實際上並不存在社會結構這種東西（它們只是弱者才需要的藉口）。斯梅爾所説的「魔幻唯意志論 (magical voluntarism)」——即相信每一個個體都有能力使自己成為自己想要成為的一切——是當代資本主義社會的主流意識形態和非官方宗教，真人秀「專家」、商業大亨和政客都在推行這套。魔幻唯意志論既是當前階級意識處於歷史地位的結果，也是其原因。它是抑鬱的反面——它的底層信念是，我們都要為自己的痛苦承擔獨一無二的責任，因此我們活該受苦。如今，英國的長期失業者身上被強加了一種特別惡毒的雙重束縛：這些一生都在接受「你一無是處」的信息的人同時又被告知，他們能做他們想做的一切。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我們必須認識到，英國民眾對緊縮政策的聽天由命的順從，是一種蓄意培養的抑鬱的後果。這種抑鬱表現為接受（對除少數精英外的所有人來説）情況會變得更糟糕，接受有工作就不錯了（所以我們不應該工資能跟上通脹的步伐），接受我們無力承擔福利國家的集體準備金。集體的抑鬱是統治階級再壓服計劃的結果。一段時間以來，我們越來越接受這樣的想法，即認為我們不是那種能夠採取行動的人。就像抑鬱的個體不可能通過「振作」就「一下子擺脫抑鬱」那樣，這並不是意志的失敗。階級意識的重建確實是一個艱鉅的任務，一個沒法通過現成的方案來完成的任務。可哪怕我們集體的抑鬱告訴我們不行，這個任務也還是可以完成的。發明新形式的政治參與、重振已顯頹勢的制度、把私人化的不滿轉化為政治化的憤怒：這一切都可能發生，而一旦發生，誰知道它會帶來怎樣的可能性呢？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>微故事: 小豬的美食 (東加豆)</title>
            <description>&lt;h2&gt;微故事: 小豬的美食 (東加豆)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;很久很久以前，在一個偏僻的山村，有一隻小豬名叫｛小豬｝。不知道牠是幸運還是不幸，牠一出生，父母就把牠賣到了農場，然而，農場主人後來又嫌棄牠，這豬生得又瘦又醜，沒有幾両肉，把牠拿去豬肉檔也沒人要，煮牠也不夠一餐吃，又浪費油、鹽、糖、火，就一手把｛小豬｝扔出門外。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;正當小豬快要餓死的時候，有一個婦人拾起牠。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;婦人沒有殺牠，也沒有賣掉牠，她收留小豬，而且搭建了一個豬籠屋給牠，是淺啡色的。從此，小豬的生活發生了翻天覆地的變化。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;婦人叫做｛麻英｝。其實小豬並不知道婦人的名字，牠只知道有小孩叫她｛嫲嫲｝，有朋友叫她｛阿英｝，所以小豬就叫她｛麻英｝。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在小豬記憶中，牠一生第一餐的食物是｛豉油雞翼｝。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛麻英｝笑咪咪捧住一大碟的豉油雞翼，從廚房行出飯廳，而且懷著一種期待的心情。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;他閉上眼睛，微笑著豉油雞翼的味道。他感受到鹹中帶甜的豉油味、薑味、蔥花，與鮮嫩多汁的雞肉完美融合，讓他心滿意足。他從心底感激這道美食，｛小兄｝的臉上寫盡了無限的幸福，這種情況麻英最開心，｛小兄｝是麻英兒子。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/21c40be8-9524-4e3b-9799-26c8de5c3152.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;再無知的小豬，牠也知道自己是一隻豬，而牠是被人收養。雖然小兄對牠不錯，麻英也很寵愛牠，至少，小兄吃什麼，小豬也吃什麼，然而，豬和人始終是不同的。小豬接過豉油雞翼，咬下去，吃！吃完一隻又一隻，卻沒有所謂好吃不好吃，吃豉油雞翼對牠來説，彷彿是在完成一個任務。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;傳聞中的豬潲和豬雜，小豬從未嚐過的，甚至未見過，因為牠根本沒有這個機會。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;今天，麻英煮了三味撚手小菜。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;梅菜蒸肉餅、絲瓜魚肉、雪梨豬展湯。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ad98ce9d-c030-4048-a78e-f4d207cb22da.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛梅菜蒸肉餅｝，麻英是不會用碎肉機弄出來的，因為它無法達到人手剁肉的效果，人手剁肉的肉粒大小和結構也不同，它能夠保留部分肉筋與纖維，使肉餅有豐富的層次感和咀嚼感，吃起來更有韌性，還有肉粒間有空隙，更容易釋放肉質的香氣，使肉餅香氣更濃。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;｛小兄｝一口咬下去，梅菜和肉混合而成的醬汁隨即爆出來，他愛死這種味道，愛死這種感覺，｛湯水｝也是人間美食，那清甜的雪梨配上鮮嫩的豬展，簡直天衣無縫！同時，這也是｛家｝的味道。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0025465c-48fa-408d-a76e-fbaab7201167.jpeg/public&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，小豬也在吃，吃是牠的例行公事，吃是牠的本能，餓了就吃，飽了就上廁所，累了就睡，天天如是。至於那味｛梅菜蒸肉餅｝牠並不瞭解什麼層次感，牠只知道它是甜和鹹的味道。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這條山村真不好，這裡竟然沒有牛、羊、雞、海鮮吃，能吃的也昂貴，大家一年到晚都是吃豬肉。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;日子一天天過去，小豬從一個瘦弱的小傢伙，長成了一個健壯的大豬，可是，牠並不瞭解這家人，也不瞭解什麼是｛家人｝，牠甚至乎不瞭解自己。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;牠問過｛麻英｝和｛小兄｝，為什麼會收養牠？可是他們並沒有回答牠。小豬已經是大豬，牠認為牠可以自由了，所以，牠決定在這裡吃最後的晚餐。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;小豬偷偷溜進廚房，牠看著麻英忙碌的背影，心裡湧上了一股説不出的感動。這種感覺，牠從來未有過。當然，麻英並不知道小豬會離開她的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;今晚的菜式是，煎石班、豉汁蒸排骨、素炒，還有大菜糕作為甜點。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9b814af3-33ab-4d1a-b174-aa370bd875d0.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;香煎石班魚，金黃酥脆的魚皮、鮮嫩多汁的魚肉，滿口生香，令人回味無窮。應該説是令｛小兄｝回味無窮，｛小兄｝也成長了，他也長成了大兄。他從小到大都一樣，每樣食物都是美，生活中的都是美，這個家，一切都是美，讓他深深體會到何謂人生之樂！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9ec338c8-5c0f-4ecf-aead-2a727ab68f9f.jpeg/public&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，小豬吃這幾道菜如同過去時光，這次卻添加了苦澀味，因為牠知道這是最後的晚餐，是作最後告別。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b4d0800b-b29c-4de6-ae7f-e413f8990218.jpeg/public&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;圖片為同時具有抱石矮牆（左下區域）和頂繩高牆（右上區域）的上海攀巖工廠。一般來説，「抱石」攀爬高度不高，但線路涉及範圍和設計思路靈活多變，不設保護繩索，牆體周圍覆蓋軟墊防止意外墜落。&amp;nbsp;圖源：知乎&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;包括在芝加哥，如今所有的攀巖館都有抱石牆，其中一半以上是純抱石館。芝加哥的攀巖館沒有一個在設計上有過專門考慮，讓殘障者和非殘障者一樣能夠暢通使用館內設施。&lt;strong&gt;對殘障者的排斥幾乎體現在巖館建築環境的每一個方面&lt;/strong&gt;：前台經常高過輪椅使用者的頭頂；用於攀巖的地板上的墊子需要人用腳踩上去；工作人員或社區成員中幾乎沒有殘障者代表；默認抱石不用繩索支撐，這些例子都只是這些巖館不夠包容的幾個小側面。因此，芝加哥的殘障攀巖者的選擇是非常有限的。旨在為殘障人士創造攀巖機會的特定項目，只允許在每週或每月的特定時段（3-4 小時）內，在有繩索攀巖的攀巖館中開展。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;為了努力實現無障礙的抱石體驗，我們需要重新斟酌如何定義抱石和攀巖。蒂奇科斯基（Titchkosky，2011，第 6 頁）曾提出「將看似‘自然’的排他性去自然化」，與之呼應，&lt;strong&gt;本篇無障礙巖館倡議對攀巖的基本組成——運動、巖館空間、攀巖者，以及定義它們的分類系統提出了質疑&lt;/strong&gt;。通過觀察對當前攀巖空間中存在的障礙，與殘障攀巖者一起攀巖、交流，我總結出了一些建議。儘管遭遇到排斥，殘障攀巖者們依然從這一運動中找到樂趣，並形成了緊密的社羣。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在一個典型的芝加哥攀巖館裏，我們可以看到一個狹隘的、卻在文化上很有影響力的攀巖定義——在這項運動中，大多數白人、身體健康的攀巖者在他們的攀巖鞋、鎂粉，有時還有一根安全繩的幫助下，登上或穿越專門為「正常人（normate）」設計的攀巖牆（Hamraie，2013）。這個定義的幾個方面一開始就有明顯的侷限性。美國攀巖界最近已經醒悟到自己缺乏種族、性別和性的多樣性，正在推動對攀巖的新理解，試圖改變這種情況（「攀巖現狀」，2019）。然而，在攀巖行業和社羣內，幾乎沒有人歡迎或考慮到當前和潛在攀巖者的豐富多樣的身心狀況。反過來，今天典型的室內攀巖者——白人、千禧年世代和非殘障羣體——可能很難想到無障礙問題與 ta 們的運動有什麼關係（「攀巖現狀」，2019）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在現代室內攀巖館中，身體健全的攀巖者可以通過他們在人造巖牆上的運動來獲得身體上的挑戰、信任和創造力。然而，攀巖的遊戲化以及攀巖館、牆體和路線的設計背後都帶有健全中心主義思維，使這些體驗對殘障攀巖者來説遙不可及。奧地利登山家弗裏茨·本內施（Fritz Benesch）在 1894 年初步創立了登山難度等級系統，經過多次迭代，這些準則基於健全者的規範，在 20 世紀末成為了對攀登運動進行分類的複雜系統（《登山指南》，2021）。&lt;strong&gt;這個系統以及後來的登山、傳統、運動和抱石分級系統，不僅將路線的難度與一些想象中的健全攀登者的能力相對應，而且還伴隨着對「強」與「弱」、「好」與「壞」、「正確」與「不正確」運動的判斷。&lt;/strong&gt;在現代攀巖館裏，有一隊身體健康的「定線員」確定的路線，每條路線都有一個明確的等級，這是基於對誰將會攀登以及 ta 們能力水平的假設。不足為奇的是，為健全人制定的路線會迫使殘疾人做一些不一定能做到或不自然的動作。因此，潛在的殘障攀巖者無法在巖館裏進行攀巖運動，並被認為不適合這項運動。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;由身體健全者確立的等級制度，也將藉助人工輔助工具的攀巖和其他攀巖區別開來。例如，利用機械裝置向上移動的輔助攀巖與自由攀巖有着不同的等級制度，自由攀巖強調不受阻礙的身體攀爬（儘管有繩子保護）。雖然具體的攀巖方法並沒有正式的等級區分，但自由攀巖因為強調獨立攀登的身體而被讚譽為「純粹」和「無阻礙」。像艾利克斯·霍諾德（Alex Honnold）這樣的自由攀巖者（在沒有繩子的情況下自由攀爬）被譽為自由和個人主義的代表，ta 們與依賴人工設備的輔助攀巖者形成鮮明對比，而後者經常出現在攀巖笑話裏。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/668f0a63-cc23-4633-a280-9b053b432e39.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;輔助攀巖的梗圖。圖中，一位標記着「輔助攀巖」的年輕女性憤怒地説「你們總是裝作比我更厲害」，而另一邊，三位穿着燕尾服晚禮服的中年男女正襟危坐、盛氣凌人，ta 們分別被標為「自由攀巖」「自由攀爬」與「抱石」。圖源：Reddit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;殘障攀巖者穿上人造支架、複雜的安全帶、多條繩索，並由旁邊的協攀者（side-climber）或報路人（caller）協助，因此自動被扔到了攀巖社會階級的底層（如果 ta 們沒有被完全無視的話）。Ta 們的攀爬因無法被置於傳統的分級模式中而顯得毫無價值，ta 們無法攀登看似「容易」的線路，而被視為弱者。很多時候，ta 們非傳統的、非個人的攀登方式甚至一開始就不被視為攀巖。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;02. &lt;strong&gt;無障礙攀巖：什麼是攀巖&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，一些殘障攀巖者已經建立了殘障友好的運動空間。可莉瑪·巴茨（Kareemah Batts）就是這樣一位攀巖者。她是一位截肢者，在紐約市與布魯克林抱石館（Brooklyn Boulders）的合作下，她創建了第一個適應性攀巖培訓班，這最終促成了適應性攀巖小組（ACG）的成立（「我們的使命」，2021）。此後，適應性攀巖小組與大紐約地區、馬薩諸塞州和芝加哥的巖館建立了夥伴關係。我參加芝加哥適應性攀巖小組的攀巖活動已經快一年了，我以志願者的身份參加 ta 們每週三晚上的課程，而我自己也是一名適應性攀巖者。參加這些攀巖課程的攀巖者有各種各樣的身心障礙，小組試圖用專門的設備來幫助 ta 們登上為「正常人」設計的攀登牆。我自己使用一個小腿支架，幫助我在牆上定位並保持對右腳的控制。&lt;strong&gt;我自己和其他殘障攀巖者的攀巖經歷，讓我不僅看到了攀巖的健全中心主義定義的更多缺陷，也感受到了一些參與者具備重新定義攀巖風格和運動的潛力。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/2e7f4139-5aa4-4d13-90cc-ef30caf1577d.webp/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;適應性攀巖小組與芝加哥、紐約州、馬薩諸塞州當地巖館合作，組織日常的室內攀巖活動，為不同需求、年齡、性別和障別的朋友提供支持服務。圖源：Adaptive Climbing Group&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;在適應性攀巖小組，我們喜歡讓攀巖者和志願者輪換結對的分組，而我則藉助這個機會來觀察不同殘障攀巖者的動作，並與 ta 們進行一些關於攀巖意義的對話。我最初的打算是與小組的適應性攀巖者進行一些半正式的採訪。這種採訪方式可以讓我記錄下 ta 們的想法，並幫助我得出更多基於經驗證據的結論。但後來我放棄了這條道路，因為我不習慣以一個訪談者的角色去和巖友們開啓會話。我轉向試着觀察 ta 們的攀巖情況，並將更多與攀巖有關的抽象問題嵌入我們平時的聊天中。這使我避免了提及更多知識化的問題，如 「你如何定義或描述攀巖」，而轉用更日常的措辭，如 「你喜歡/不喜歡攀巖嗎？」或「你最喜歡攀巖的部分是什麼？」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這些攀巖者的回答頗具啓發性，涉及到了諸多與攀爬動作和實踐有關的基本元素。正如一位攀巖者所描述的（我曾輔助這位女性攀爬過幾次），她最喜歡攀巖的地方在於它對身體所激發的挑戰。她描述了攀爬怎樣使她能夠動用全身、讓肌肉和身體的其他部分發力，而這些是針對性的治療性鍛鍊通常容易忽略的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;説到&lt;strong&gt;「全身的肌肉參與」&lt;/strong&gt;，我自己在攀巖中也經常注意到，因為新的動作能促使我收緊某些平時不太覺察的身體部位。當我輔助攀巖時，一些新的肌肉參與也非常明顯。協攀者的主要任務在於與主攀者協調動作，置放手和腳，或提供背部借力以及抬升支持。這需要特定的心智敏鋭度、身體協調性、有效的溝通以及推動動作，而個人攀登則涉及不到這些。我曾與其他殘障攀巖者交流相關經驗，大家的反應是一致的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/85a96b45-6a48-4dbb-ac2c-beac28484486.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;一位適應性攀巖者正在調試假肢，為上牆做準備。他身邊散落着單隻攀巖鞋與下肢假肢。圖源：Adaptive Climbing Group Chicago@BKB West Loop&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;我與另一位攀巖者在攀巖間隙中聊天進一步展開了這類體驗的微妙之處。他告訴我，事實上，他在攀巖上的進步關乎「學習如何信任和使用他的假肢」的問題。他描述了某些動作如何迫使他使用假肢，而他最初對假肢的不信任導致他用其他肌肉過度補償，從而很快導致力竭。這些攀巖者將攀巖描述為&lt;strong&gt;對其殘障身體的使用（engagement）和信賴&lt;/strong&gt;，這顛覆了健全中心主義的規範中所謂的「有用」或「有效」。在此，過度依賴於健全身體反而是侷限的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;作為一名協攀者、以及為坐式攀巖者（seated climbers）提供保護的團隊成員，我自身的經驗同樣進一步挑戰了「攀巖純粹靠個人努力」的傳統成見。正如我在前文提到的，作為協攀者與人一同攀爬需要精準的溝通、相互的協調，這體現了這種攀巖方式的&lt;strong&gt;集體性特徵&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ee051903-7677-45a5-ac27-8aabcb671952.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;為了平衡挑戰難度與對攀巖者的幫助程度，其中所需要的身體關注意味着攀巖者和保護團隊就像一個攀巖的集體單元，大家一起努力完成攀爬。圖源：Adaptive Climbing Group Chicago@BKB West Loop&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;當然，頂繩保護員的工作也有類似的特點，儘管由於其位處地面而相對不那麼明顯。然而，對於一組地面保護員，尤其是當與需要幫助升高、拉下手柄上升器等支持的坐式攀巖者組隊配合時，必須與對方、攀巖者彼此協調，以精準把握拉動繩索的力度。為了平衡挑戰難度與對攀巖者的幫助程度，其中所需要的身體關注意味着攀巖者和保護團隊就像一個攀巖的集體單元，大家一起努力完成攀爬。&lt;strong&gt;這些不同形式的攀爬根植於社羣，實現了社羣和攀巖之間的連續性——許多健全中心主義的商業巖館嚮往於此，但往往無法實現。&lt;/strong&gt;事實上，「社羣（community）」幾乎出現在我所遇到的幾乎每一個攀巖館的使命宣言裏，然而，我（包括許多其他跟我交談過的成員）經常感覺到這些攀巖館中強烈的個人主義與其所聲稱培養的「社羣精神」之間的脫節。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我對適應性攀巖小組成員牆上動作的觀察證實了關於挑戰和集體的探討。Ta 們也在重新定義大多數攀巖者認為的「好」或「強」的技術。這些攀巖者讓我領悟到，搖晃、顫抖、手腳摸索、呼喚支持、抽動、休息、快樂或恐懼的尖叫，以及對話，都是試圖在攀巖牆上控制身體的方式，強大、有用也有益。對於這些攀巖者來説，攀巖不應拘於狹隘的定義，那關乎挑戰、風險、信任、樂趣、社羣、創造力、新奇和變化。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;最後，小組成員反覆向我表達的一個觀點是，抱石對 ta 們遙不可及，因為不願意接受自己的身體可能無法控制或承受的跌落。由於缺乏繩索支持，許多適應性攀巖者自動被抱石攀巖排除在外了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;03. &lt;strong&gt;打造一個無障礙的抱石館&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;抱石是我第一次接觸到的攀巖項目，也是我最主要練習、最喜歡的項目。而且，正如我在上文所提及的，抱石是在巖館裏排除殘障者最嚴重的攀巖形式之一。根據我關於攀巖等級、攀巖定線的健全中心主義性質的分析，以及與殘障攀巖者的對話，我試圖重構目前以健全者為中心的巖館，通過工具輔助或者人際支持，讓攀巖牆和攀巖變得更加觸手可及。我試圖關注巖館的建成環境來展現殘障攀巖者眼中攀巖最重要的部分。&lt;strong&gt;這樣的攀巖館將承認並慶祝集體形式的攀巖，並消除賦予非殘障攀巖者特權的等級系統。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;儘管如此，我的提議只是一個起點——它根植於與殘障者的真實對話和經驗，探討對攀巖本身的基本理解。我的設計方法最接近於通用設計的理念，試圖為儘可能多的身體和心智提供途徑（Hamraie, 2013）。當然，我不可避免地抱有「偏見」——我赤誠相信，只要有適當的機會，每個人都可以擁有暢快的攀爬體驗，無論是高牆還是矮牆。（事實上，這裏提出的許多想法也可以適用於頂繩巖館。）在實現這一個人夢想漫長反覆迭代的過程裏，這個設計方案是一個開端。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;儘管其實攀巖體驗在攀巖者進入巖館的大門之前就已經開始了，不過，我將把我的設計方案的範圍聚焦於對攀巖行為本身最具體的運動環境。因此，本文將不會討論無障礙通道、桌子、照明、音樂、座位、停車場、浴室/衞生間設施以及其他設施，如舉重室或瑜伽室。當為殘障人士設計時，巖館環境中的這些元素是創造舒適和「棲居（dwelling）」感受的重要落點，並且，已經在關注無障礙的殘障研究文本中得到了充分的討論（Bauman, 2014, p. 390）。而攀巖牆這一相對小眾的主題在目前關於無障礙的文本中還未被涉及，因此，我嘗試對此加以探討。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我倡議的無障礙攀巖館，&lt;strong&gt;最顯著特徵在於以多角度的自由攀爬牆（spray wall）取代確定或「設定好」的路線；同時取消所謂的「定線員」，而建立一個由殘障與非殘障攀巖者組成的「攀巖工友（Climbing Staff）」，負責為攀巖者提供互動支持，協助其使用設施；以及在所有攀巖牆上安裝可選的繩索支撐。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在我的想象中，巖館的「攀巖工友」與攀巖者一起攀爬，提供幫助，並確保館內所有攀巖者的安全。攀巖工作人員分散於館內，身着易於辨認的制服，ta 們將協助設置繩索保護系統，並協助攀巖者根據我在下文概述的機制設計自己的攀爬。關鍵在於，工作人員將由各種外形、身材、膚色、能力和性格的經驗豐富的攀巖個體組成。Ta 們還將觀察、記錄場館裏任何對攀巖者來説不可及之處，並有權啓動再設計。與攀巖者在地面與牆壁上共處的經驗將使工作人員與攀爬空間親近而熟悉，充分理解改善的入口。我希望這將使設計持續發生，不斷完善巖館的環境。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/a78aab47-d954-4f8c-a645-ca4173a8a97c.jpeg/public&quot;

referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;自由攀爬牆上面佈滿了根據變化而策劃的巖點，而非預先設定的路線。圖源：Stōkt&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;自由攀爬牆讓攀爬者變成為自己設計路線的人，並根據自己的優勢和侷限來確定難度。&lt;/strong&gt;因此，這消除了對定線團隊的需求，並不再強加與之相關的對規範性身體運動和分級系統的假設。在我看來，只要這些牆可以體驗和攀爬（我將在接下來討論該問題），殘障攀巖者就一定可以設定並分享 ta 們認為適當挑戰 ta 們身體的攀爬。創造攀爬的過程是一種樂趣，與此同時，也為攀爬行為增添了心智上的挑戰。攀巖者可以在「Stōkt」、「Eat Spray Love」或「Retro Flash」等專門的手機應用程序上公開發布 ta 的攀爬過程，供其他人嘗試，通過分享想法和身體鍛鍊，社羣意識得以培養（「Retro Flash」，2022；」Stōkt For Gyms」，2021）。另一種更符合傳統巖館設定的路徑是組建一個擁有多樣類型身體的定線團隊，但這必然無法囊括所有潛在攀巖者的身體。為什麼不直接讓殘障攀巖者設計自己的攀爬路線呢？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;讓殘障攀巖者自主設計攀爬路線，這意味着 ta 們需要從地面或墊子能夠看到、摸到或聽到巖壁本身，而且設計路線需要能夠被記錄下來，以便之後可以攀爬。對於視覺攀爬者來説，這可以通過觀察牆壁、想象、測試和在筆記本或 Stōkt 等應用程序上記錄路線來實現（「Stōkt For Gyms」，2021）。而盲人攀巖者馬修·希弗林（Matthew Shifrin）則提出了一種在攀爬前先用樂高積木策劃路線的觸覺法（「樂高系統 Lego System」，2020）。正如他所描述的，「觸摸是有順序的。當你用樂高積木搭建時，尺度如此之小，如此便捷，以至於你能輕鬆把整棟建築、整個城市景觀都掌控在手中。」（「一個新的系統 A new system」，2020, 00:02:41）。樂高積木繪圖是由馬修的報路人完成的——報路即指當馬修在牆上時，與馬修溝通，並將馬修的手引導到適當的位置——攀巖工友可以通過訓練來承擔這個角色。儘管馬修是用隨機選擇的樂高積木來預先制定路線的，不過，不妨借鑑這種方法，通過策劃一套樂高積木以達到設計目的，這套樂高積木可以對應所有主要的巖點類型（包括：crimps 小扣點，pinches 長條捏點, pockets 指洞/口袋點, jugs 抓握點/大把手）及尺寸。&lt;strong&gt;我建議巖館攀巖工友與視障攀巖者合作，使用樂高積木設計路線，隨後將其記錄在 Stōkt 等應用上，以便後期回顧。&lt;/strong&gt;在我的想象中，巖館裏所有的自由攀爬牆都配有大箱的樂高積木碎片和木板，供視障攀巖者自主設計路線。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;當沒有攀巖工友擔當報路人時，自由攀爬牆也可以使用聽覺提示來幫助視障攀巖者在攀巖過程中確定巖點的位置。其中一種可能的路徑，是設計一個鏈接到應用程序的攀巖牆，在攀巖序列中引發特定的巖點發出聲響提示。當攀巖者抓到某個巖點，將促使該序列中的後續巖點放出聲音，使攀爬者得以確定自己與下一個巖點的關係，併為連接動作做好相應的準備。儘管據我所知，目前尚未有任何攀巖牆有這種功能，但我相信這種技術是可實現的——已經有許多攀巖牆通過應用程序讓與用戶自設路線對應的巖點發亮，比如非常流行的月亮板、「K 板（Kilter Board）」和「T 板（tension board）」等等。&lt;strong&gt;聽覺和觸覺引導的配置將使非視覺攀巖者在上牆之前就能構思、繪製、設計攀巖路線。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/6499cb0c-bb6f-458d-8fc5-aa3484bd200e.png/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;自由攀爬牆的所有巖點都可以被電子化，在應用程序上拖拉、移動，進行設計。聽覺和觸覺引導的配置將使非視覺攀巖者在上牆之前就能構思、繪製、設計攀巖路線。圖源：Stōkt&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;不過，一旦攀巖者設計了某種攀爬線路，ta 們必須能夠親自嘗試，而巖館應當提供安全協助，不管是藉由物質還是人員支持。首先，抱石牆的底部通常有厚厚的墊子，它們之間需要有配備輪椅通行的坡道，且不妨礙移動。其次，牆體必須足夠高（最好有 15 英尺高，這是室內抱石的最大允許高度），這樣，喜歡只用手臂的攀巖者就可以從巖壁中間開始，在到達牆頂之前仍有足夠的空間進行 5-10 個動作。最後，每面牆都需要配備多條繩索，固定於攀巖牆的頂部，以便在需要的情況下允許多人繫繩保護。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在抱石館中引入繩索可能徹底重新定義了抱石體驗，也帶來了相當多的後勤難題。創造性的抱石序列通常同時涉及垂直與橫向運動，與其他攀爬線路重疊，延展穿過不同角度的牆壁。例如，在一個有繩索系統的無障礙抱石館裏，不可能出現牆壁平行於地面的陡峭洞穴。然而，俯角壁（slab walls，與地面形成鈍角的牆壁）、直壁（與地面垂直）和陡至 70 度的仰角壁（與地面形成 90 度以下的角度）可以讓攀巖者以坐姿開始攀爬，同時在墜落時仍能被繩索保護到。70 度仰角的設計基於這樣一個事實：攀爬者的起始位置需要在牆的長度上有足夠的距離（即斜邊），這樣一來，ta 到牆頂的距離才可能會小於牆的高度——想象一堵牆，它與地面形成一個直角三角形，牆是三角形的斜邊，牆的高度即為從牆頂到地面的垂直距離。在一堵 4.5 米高的 70 度仰角牆上，攀爬者只需要把自己拉到離地面 30 釐米以上的起始位置，繩子就能在空間裏接住 ta。對於垂直壁和俯角壁來説，這並不是問題：攀爬者到牆頂的距離和繩子長度總是相等的，這意味着任何高於零米的起始位置都可以實現空中接力。當然，從仰角壁上墜落會使攀爬者前後擺動，但保護員會在那裏協助減緩衝力，使其隨後不會以很大的幅度蕩回牆上。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0868baf8-136c-45d5-831b-49f5a31549b3.jpeg/public&quot;

            <title>823 父親養成指南：從只出一張嘴的豬隊友，進化成參與育兒教養的新時代神隊友</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;野獸按：今天看到一本《父親養成指南》，被該書的副標題逗笑了。於是谷歌了一下看看這本書的介紹和節選，覺得蠻有意思，還看到還有王浩威兄的推薦，於是下單購買了一本。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img

class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;父性是天生內建，還是後天習得？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;從「我」到「我們」，男人如何調適成為父親的過程？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;爸爸也可能罹患「產後憂鬱症」？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;如果你對「父親」身分感到好奇，&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;或面臨以下情境，&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;一定不能錯過這本書！&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;◆&lt;strong&gt;「什麼都我在做！」&lt;/strong&gt;──哀嘆自家沒有神隊友的媽媽&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;◆&lt;strong&gt;「我顧不來，孩子也只要媽媽……」&lt;/strong&gt;──也想晉升老婆心目中神隊友的爸爸&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;◆&lt;strong&gt;「我們的生活不再只是兩個人了！」&lt;/strong&gt;──即將展開育兒旅程的家庭&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;◆&lt;strong&gt;「到底該如何理解『父親』角色？」&lt;/strong&gt;──想了解最新「父職」研究者&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;「為人父母」是許多人經歷最深刻改變生命的經驗之一。然而，相較於母親，父親在這段過程中遭遇的衝擊和困境，卻往往遭到低估，甚至被忽略。事實上，父性與母性的概念同樣深刻，對孩子的成長、家庭運作與社會穩定皆影響深遠。媽媽懷孕時，爸爸會藉由想像孩子的模樣、未來與孩子的互動關係，進而思考自己希望成為什麼樣的父親。這段過程中，爸爸的賀爾蒙也會因此發生類似媽媽的變化，令男人逐漸進入「父親」這個新角色。&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;現代雙親共同擔任教養者的現象逐漸成為主流，雙薪家庭、小家庭的比例提升，加上更認知到父親角色對孩童發展的關鍵影響，促使男性對親職參與展現出前所未有的積極態度。但這批新時代的爸爸不免面臨各種疑問：&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;‧怎樣才算得上是稱職的好父親？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;‧初為人父的焦慮該如何排解？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;‧父職會帶來何種心理與生理上的改變？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;而這些爸爸的另一半，也可能會受這些煩惱所苦：&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;‧為什麼伴侶沒辦法立刻進入父親的身分，擔負起顧家及育兒義務？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;‧我該如何理解並支持他走過扛起父職的過渡期？&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;作者安娜．麥菁博士是牛津大學實驗心理學系的演化人類學家，專注父職研究將近十年。在本書中，她從五十萬年前的父親如何確保人類種族的存續，又與今日父職經驗有何種關聯説起，探討家庭中的「父親角色」與「父職經驗」。《父親養成指南》不是一本教人成為完美父親的教戰手冊，而是讓爸爸們暢所欲言，從全新觀點來帶領讀者思考父親本質，檢視「身為父親」的科學、社會、文化意義，協助新手爸爸能以輕鬆愉快的心情踏上「為人父」這趟富有挑戰性的旅程！&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;【國內外好評推薦】&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;王浩威／精神科醫師&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;丘美珍／媽媽悅讀基地創辦人&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;邦妮＆蓋瑞小夫妻／醫師作家&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;吳鳳／金鐘獎主持人、作家&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;林仁廷／諮商心理師&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;陳其正（醜爸）／親職教育顧問&lt;br

class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;魏瑋志（澤爸）／親職教育講師&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;（依姓名筆劃排列）&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;很喜歡這本探討父性的書，從生物學、人類演化和文化環境……等等，多面向的探討了爸爸的角色，也幫助我瞭解自己那些內心的矛盾與困惑，相信讀者們看完後，也能在擔綱父親身分上更加遊刃有餘！&lt;strong&gt;──邦妮＆蓋瑞小夫妻／醫師作家&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;「父親是什麼？」父親是帶領孩子進入社會，開始冒險與探索的前導示範，與母親相異卻同等重要。本書闡述了父職在親職面不是僅為協助者，而有其獨特意義，值得一讀。&lt;strong&gt;──林仁廷／諮商心理師&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;多年來，我嘗試透過人類、心理學等理論，幫助母親們看見父親在育兒的困境與挑戰。終於有了這本書，就讓更專業的來！&lt;strong&gt;──陳其正（醜爸）／親職教育顧問&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;對於母職，我們累積豐富的描述、討論和頌讚，面向父職，卻幾近一無所知。一直以來，父親多半等同養家者形象，安娜•麥菁從科學的角度，揭露父職滋養、照顧與愛的多元面貌，獻給思考如何作父親的每一個你。&lt;strong&gt;──梁莉芳／東華大學社會學系助理教授&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;這是英國著作啊！世界排名佔前的男性育嬰大國，從家電廣告到流行電視劇都有不少愛家男人全職父親的橋段，週六早晨的公園裡只有爸爸與孩子，亞洲無法相信的奇景處處上演。別再笑英國研究領先全球數十年，有媽媽看不下去，幫天下老公出書解套，你，看是不看？&lt;strong&gt;──隱藏角色／別人的老公&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;安娜．麥菁集結了最新的父職研究與新手爸爸的真實故事。這是一本發人深省、鼓舞人心與感動你我的著作。&lt;strong&gt;——尼克．威爾基（Nick Wilkie）／英國慈善團體國家生育信託執行長&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;是時候開始將科學應用在實際的父職領域了。真實的父職經驗與社會對父職的認知依然差距甚大。《父親的新角色》所敍述的科學發現，帶給我們突破困境的信心。&lt;strong&gt;——鄧肯．費雪（Duncan Fisher）／家庭推廣組織（Family Initiative）創辦人，曾獲頒大英帝國官佐勳章（OBE）&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;探討家長身分被遺忘的父親，精彩至極。準爸爸與媽媽的必讀之作。&lt;strong&gt;——羅賓．鄧巴（Robin Dunbar）／牛津大學教授&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br class=&quot;smart&quot;&gt;這本書以最新研究為基礎，感動人心、資訊豐富，而且通俗易讀。值得每一位家長與（外）祖父母、以及所有健康、教育和社會照護領域的專業人士拜讀。&lt;strong&gt;——艾德里安娜．伯吉斯（Adrienne Burgess）／父職研究所（Fatherhood

Raeburn）在《父親重不重要？讓科學告訴你！》（Do Fathers Matter?: What Science Is Telling Us About the Parent We’ve Overlooked），從演化生物學、神經科學、社會學、發展心理學的角度深入探討「父親」這個家長，在孩子各個成長階段所扮演的角色。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，保羅．雷伯恩畢竟是位父親，有視角偏頗之嫌，這本《&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;

Life of Dad : the making of a modern father），卻是一位女性人類學家，在研究了大量父親和準父親後撰寫出來的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;過去十年，牛津大學實驗心理學系的演化人類學家安娜．麥菁（Anna Machin），勾勒出從受孕、蹣跚學步到以後的旅程中，小孩如何需要父親，其中包括異性戀和同性戀的父親。 這本書不是假設父親應該是什麼，不是本談「應然」的書，而是本談父親本來面目的書，探討的是「實然」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;《父親養成指南》詳細解釋了生物上和生活經歷如何把男人變成父親。父親對孩子的塑造也對孩子及其未來產生積極影響。麥菁也鼓勵父親要有發言權，可以彼此分享經歷和感受。雖然她舉的許多案例來自她土生土長的英國，但是對其他社會仍很有參考價值。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;《父親養成指南》指出，在過去的五十年裡，英國父親的角色發生了翻天覆地的變化，台灣也有異曲同工之妙。父親不再希望被限制在養家餬口和管教者的角色上，而是想成為真正的共同父母，為孩子提供一樣的養育和照顧。產生這種變化的部分原因，兩地也差不多，有雙薪家庭的增加、以醫院為基礎的產後護理的減少以及大家庭的消失，讓照料新生兒沒父親介入下滯礙難行。我有不少已婚女性朋友甚至都要老公承諾一些養育子女才懷孕生育。這個轉變也讓愈來愈多父親們感到他們其實有能力參與其中，並且清楚他們對孩子和家庭跟媽媽一樣重要。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;從上世紀七十年代開始的英國，父親成為分娩室的常客，如今，有超過九成的男性參加了孩子的出生。在台灣，老公陪同老婆一起分娩也愈來愈常見。儘管有研究證據顯示，準爸媽把分娩視為一種團隊經歷。但是許多父親仍然覺得自己有點像備用品，而不是平等的參與者。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;因為媽媽在分娩過程中經歷重大的身體體驗，讓人忘了爸爸也在經歷著重大的心理和生理變化。分娩時刻的參與，對父親與孩子建立情感紐帶，以及在心理上承擔「爸爸」的職責都很重要。在科技的幫助下，男人還可以稍微體驗一下分娩之痛哦！近年就有不少台灣網紅爭先恐後地嘗試：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;法規對父親參與新生兒的出生與照顧非常關鍵。台灣目前《性別工作平等法》的陪產檢及陪產假規定是：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;「受僱者陪伴其配偶妊娠產檢或其配偶分娩時，僱主應給予『陪產檢及陪產假』七日；『陪產檢及陪產假』期間薪資照給；僱主依規定給付『陪產檢及陪產假』薪資後，就其中逾五日之部分得向中央主管機關申請補助。但依其他法令規定，應給予『陪產檢及陪產假』逾五日且薪資照給者，不適用之。補助業務，由勞動部勞工保險局辦理；『陪產檢及陪產假』七日，除陪產檢於配偶妊娠期間請假外，受僱者陪產之請假，應於配偶分娩之當日及其前後合計十五日期間內為之」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;其中「陪產檢及陪產假」是 2022 年初從五日修訂成七日的，雖然是進步，但和 OECD 國家（經濟合作暨發展組織）的陪產假中位數為 2.1 週相比，顯得超扣門，對解決少子化問題幾乎沒有幫助吧？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;傳統上，大家都認為母性是本能的，但父性是後天學習到的。事實上，爸爸和媽媽一樣在生理基礎上為當父母做了準備。所有新進父親在出生前後，都會經歷睾固酮的永久性下降，甚至在某些情況下高達三分之一。 這一下降至關重要，因為它不僅讓男人成為一個善解人意和親力親為的父親，而且還消除了高睾固酮對形成情感紐帶的激素之抑制作用，確保父親與新寶寶的互動中自我感覺良好。再加上這種大腦變化，增加了養育、注意力、同理心和解決問題的能力。麥菁主張，別把父親降級為次要育兒角色，他們當得上一個真正的共同父母。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;《父親養成指南》指出，除了挑戰性別化的育兒角色外，同性戀父親還告訴我們很多關於父親大腦巨大彈性的資訊。從對異性戀父母的研究中得知，媽媽和爸爸在與孩子互動時表現出不同大腦活動，這反映了他們演化上不同的角色。但對主要照顧者同性戀父親的研究顯示，在沒有母親的情況下，這些父親在「媽媽」和「爸爸」的大腦區域都表現出相似的活動。顯然同性戀父親可以扮演好照顧孩子所需要的一切。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;《父親養成指南》指出，父親也會與他們的孩子建立深刻而強大的紐帶，這種紐帶與母子之間的紐帶一樣牢固，但卻又截然不同。媽媽和爸爸都有建立在教養基礎上的紐帶，但爸爸有額外的挑戰，這反映在他們幫助孩子進入家庭以外的世界方面所扮演的角色。無論在哪個文化之中，父親都會突破舒適圈，讓孩子接受風險和挑戰，這有助於他們建立在快速變化和充滿挑戰的世界中生存所需的身心適應力。他們做到這一點的最有效方法之一就是透過和孩子玩那些最好別讓媽媽看到的遊戲。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;父親和孩子玩的是較粗暴的遊戲，在快速而激烈的活動中，孩子們被拋到空中，在房間裡飛來飛去，被瘋狂撓癢而尖叫和咯咯笑。這是一種幾乎完全由父親進行的遊戲形式，除了充滿樂趣之外，它在情感紐帶和兒童發展方面也起著至關重要的作用。由於具有挑戰性和風險性，這樣的遊戲能夠培養所有孩子都需要的互惠、同理心、風險評估和克服挑戰的技能。這樣的父子玩耍，是與媽媽一起玩耍無法取代的。這是演化而來的天性吧，難怪我只要看到小小阿宅，都有把他們捉來用力捏一捏、扭一扭、摔一摔再拋到空中的衝動⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;身為人類學家，麥菁也在《父親養成指南》指出，父親的形式是多元的，男人以多種方式履行他們的職責。雖然在西方現代社會，爸爸就是親生父親，但是其他地方的情況並非一定如此。「爸爸」就是站出來做這項工作的人，可以是祖父、叔叔、朋友或老師。有些孩子甚至有一整個爸爸團隊。決定父親是誰的因素通常是環境因素的混合，包括經濟風險以及文化規則，因為父親不像母親那樣受到生物學上的限制。隨著現代社會中主要是以小家庭的模式在經營，因此她建議我們可以向世界上的爸爸們學習，並打開眼界，擴寬我們對成為爸爸意味著什麼的看法。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我老婆和朋友看到我的書櫃有這本《父親養成指南》，都露出詭異的表情⋯⋯但我還是得説，這是本值得所有想當好爸爸的朋友一讀的好書，而且媽媽或想當媽媽的朋友更應該好好一讀，瞭解一下老公能夠如何成為神隊友哦！&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;《父親養成指南》：與孩子出生前的關係，大部分來自爸爸的想像力與努力&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;我們想讓你知道的是&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我們知道象徵懷孕與分娩所形成的神經化學物質——催產素與多巴胺——也存在爸爸體內，但作用的強度遠比媽媽弱，所需的時間和努力也比媽媽多。然而，進化機制並沒有讓爸爸只能靠想像參與懷孕的過程，還有一招可以幫助爸爸進入父親身分：睪固酮是讓男孩蛻變成男人的荷爾蒙。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;文：安娜・麥菁（Anna Machin）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;對大多數的爸爸而言，越到伴侶懷孕後期，他們與胎兒的依附關係就越深厚。然而，一些爸爸在培養這種關係的過程並不順利。部分男性（如以下提到的吉姆）可能欠缺適當的父職角色模範，部分則需要克服心理障礙，還有一些則會與孩子的媽媽產生衝突。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;兒子出生之前，我花很多時間在思考，我應該做什麼？扮演什麼角色？父母在我很小的時候就離婚了，當爸爸對我來説是非常困難的事情，因為我沒有一個真正的父親典範可以學習……。我的父親與我感情疏遠，他只在週末來探望我、和我説笑，但我想成為關心兒子與花時間陪伴他的爸爸，而不是像我父親那樣沒有機會和自己的孩子相處。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——尚恩（六個月大）的爸爸吉姆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;在此情況下，評估爸爸在孩子出生前與胎兒的依附關係，有助於判斷親子關係未來會遇到的問題，進而對整個社會產生廣泛的影響。如在第十章所見，身為父親，與孩子的關係有可能對他們的行為、情緒與心理發展造成深刻影響，這些與母親對孩子的任何影響不大相同。在緊密的親子依附關係中，父親能促使孩子擁有良好的心理健康、鼓勵他們獨立自主，並支持他們的行為和語言發展。但是，如果親子依附關係不健全，便有可能對孩子、家庭及社會造成負面影響。與父母關係不穩定的孩子，比一般人更有可能出現反社會行為、成癮與心理問題。康頓在胎兒依附關係的研究中發現，爸爸與胎兒的依附連結——連同父母之間的感情——最能預測寶寶出生後與他的感情會有多深厚。這是一項極為有力的研究，因為可以藉此辨別需要鞏固的依附關係，甚至在孩子出生前就能提早發現。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;爸爸與孩子在產前的關係，大部分都歸功於爸爸的想像力與努力，這些包含想像孩子的模樣與未來和他／她的感情、盡可能與肚子裡的寶寶互動、花時間思考希望成為哪一種父親。以提姆為例：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;我希望我有與寶寶培養出感情……這很困難，感覺就像你對肚子裡的寶寶説話，而他根本不知道你是什麼人或是你在幹嘛。雖然如此，我跟他説很多話，也經常撫摸妻子的肚子。我希望得到參與感。幾天前，我們玩了擊掌遊戲，我輕拍妻子的肚子，而肚子裡的寶寶也回應我……。他有可能只是在打嗝，但這種感覺真的很棒、很酷。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——即將成為父親的提姆&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;我們知道象徵懷孕與分娩所形成的神經化學物質——催產素與多巴胺——也存在爸爸體內，但作用的強度遠比媽媽弱，所需的時間和努力（撇開分娩不談）也比媽媽多。然而，進化機制並沒有讓爸爸只能靠想像參與懷孕的過程，還有一招可以幫助爸爸進入父親身分。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;很多人説睪固酮（testosterone，又稱睪丸素）是讓男孩蛻變成男人的荷爾蒙。在胎兒長到六至十二週大時於子宮內分泌，使男嬰長出陰莖與睪丸，並促成腦部的發展。多數人認為男嬰出生後，有賴於睪固酮及其對大腦發育和行為的影響，他們才會偏好男生的玩具，還有將棒狀的物體都當成刀劍或手槍玩耍。在青春期，睪固酮控制脂肪與肌肉的分佈以及骨骼的發育，使青少年的下巴、肩膀與胸部變寬，也促進胸部、臉部與生殖器毛髮的生長。這種荷爾蒙決定了你將會是多稱職的伴侶與父親。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;長期以來，人們認為血液裡睪固酮含量較多的男性比較容易吸引伴侶。可能的原因有二：男性受到睪固酮的影響有更多動力追求女性，以及女性偏好下巴寬大、胸部肌肉發達的男性（這樣比較能保護她們、給予更多的安全感）。然而，當男人決定與一個女人長相廝守、組成家庭，之前帶來助益的大量睪固酮突然間變成了阻礙。雖然他試著專心扮演忠誠伴侶與父親的新角色，但荷爾蒙會驅使他繼續尋找其他伴侶，因而危害到任何需要他照顧的後代。這個現象稱為「挑戰假説」（challenge hypothesis），而其本身無疑也是種挑戰。這個假説由英國動物學家約翰・溫菲爾德（John Wingfield）率先提出，試圖解決男性如何在有小孩之前對伴侶忠誠，在生兒育女之後又能成為盡職父親的難題。辦法是，睪固酮必須犧牲。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;現實的確如此。在來自不同文化的父親，從實行一夫多妻制的塞內加爾農民、重視子女教育的以色列中產階級、四處播種的菲律賓男性、努力賺錢養家的加拿大白領階級、不與妻子同住的牙買加男性，再到我自己英國父親族羣，這些爸爸體內的睪固酮含量遠比非人父者低，無論他們是否與小孩同住。我們知道睪固酮含量較低的男性比較會安撫小孩，會更希望與伴侶共同養育孩子，對孩子的同理心與感情也勝過睪固酮較多的男性。睪固酮是父性行為各有不同的主要因素。我們將在第六章深入探討這個部分。問題來了，為人父者體內的睪固酮含量普遍比沒有小孩的人夫少，是否純粹因為睪固酮含量較少的男性生了小孩？還是當了爸爸之後，睪固酮的分泌量就會減少？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;美國伊利諾州（Illinois）西北大學（Northwestern University）的學者李・格特勒（Lee Gettler）提供瞭解答。在其開創性的五年研究中，格特勒與同事追蹤一羣菲律賓男性展開伴侶關係與當了爸爸之後的變化。研究人員在這些菲律賓男性還是單身時，測量其睪固酮基礎值。五年後，再度拜訪這羣男性。在研究初期接受測試的六百二十四名男性中，其中有一百六十二人在這段期間第一次當了爸爸。這些人在研究初期睪固酮含量位居羣體之冠，但是五年後的睪固酮數值是受試者當中最低的一羣。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;那些依然單身與已有伴侶但沒有小孩的男性，其睪固酮的含量則沒有明顯變化。格特勒找到答案。體內睪固酮含量高的男性比較容易找到伴侶，當爸爸之後睪固酮含量減少的程度也最大。睪固酮含量會受到父親的身分所抑制，雖然分泌量在孩子出生的前幾週略微增加，但再也沒有回復到當爸爸之前的程度。生物的進化選擇了一種機制，讓男人成功兼顧單身男子與盡責父親互相衝突的需求。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;《父親養成指南》：父親對於青少年子女的發展，如同對學步幼兒一樣重要&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;我們想讓你知道的是&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;當母親還在處於懷孕與哺乳的無限循環中，父親在孩子的青春期發揮十分重要的作用，負責管教孩子逾矩和負面的行為，並扮演教師與嚮導的角色。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;文：安娜・麥菁（Anna Machin）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;父親在兒童發展中的角色&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在人類史絕大部分的時間裡，父親據信對子女的發展毫無貢獻。一般認為，孩子的口語能力、運動神經與音樂或創作天賦，全是從與母親之間緊密且獨有的連結而來；關鍵在於母親一個人的影響力。親生父親無疑貢獻了一些基因，但人們認為，成長環境是最重要的因素，而這個環境由持續照顧與養育孩子的母親所維護。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;身為演化人類學家，我實在無法接受這種看法。這否定了進化的基本規則：效率。進化機制是自然世界中一板一眼的會計師。它會盡力透過最有效與最具成本效益的可行路徑來達成目標——物種的生存。但是，人類似乎希望藉由極其複雜的方式來解決生存危機，方法就是創造相對罕見的父職角色。如此一來，人類的合作、生理構造、交配行為與生命史會經歷重大變化。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一直以來大多避免互相接觸的男性與女性，突然間必須合力進行性行為以外的事情，男性的大腦必須進化才能教導與照顧孩子，成人必須與連續單一配偶制所主導的生命歷程妥協，還有青少年這種生物也出現了。有了這些演變，我們難道不開心？這是巨大的變遷，而且極具風險。如果人類要能經歷生物機制與行為的重大變化、進化要推動這些改變，為人父者就必須賦予孩子某種獨特且關乎生存的事物。他必須對子女的發展發揮影響力。這一章我想探討，孩子人生初期與通往青春期的崎嶇道路上，父親具有什麼樣的影響力。在開始討論之前，需要先認識人類組織生活的獨特方式，還有為何只有人類物種的父母，必須面對愛耍脾氣的學步兒童與愛理不理的青少年。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;精力是人生的貨幣，而「生命史」意指人在一生中投入精力的方式。所有動物的精力都是有限的，大致分為三種投入方式：發育、生命的維持與繁殖。一個人選擇如何將精力分散在這三個領域中，將深刻影響自己的一生，包括何時喝奶、何時第一次交配、一次生下多少後代、長得多大及活得多久。就拿背部毛髮為銀灰色的黑猩猩與田鼠，兩種體型差異甚大的動物來説好了。我們知道，妻妾成羣的銀背黑猩猩必須發展與維持壯碩的體格，才能控制羣體、擊退有意競爭的成年雄性並保護家人。這會消耗牠大部分的精力，但因為牠除了偶爾心不在焉地陪孩子玩耍與容許他們偷吃食物之外，並不會照顧兒女，所以幸好牠實際上在繁殖方面付出很少，只有一些精子而已。因此，牠一生的大部分精力都投入在發育與生命的維持上。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;對比之下，天平的另一端是雌性的田鼠。這種小型生物在出生僅十天後便能進行繁殖，壽命最多隻有一年。牠在發育和維生方面消耗的精力極少，但極度早熟的性徵與每三十五天可生下多達十四胎的能力，代表牠在繁殖投入大量精力。不同於可在圈養條件下活到五十五歲的黑猩猩，這種小老鼠體現了「活在當下，不求長壽」而這句諺語。相較之下，儘管一些人認為自己擁有及時行樂的靈魂，但人類肯定屬於銀背黑猩猩的這一邊；因為我們從為期不短的童年開始發育，再緩慢進入老年階段。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;而生命史另一個面向是發育階段的數量、發育階段出現的時間點及持續的長度，同樣會受人類分配一生精力的獨特方式所影響。按一般規則，奉行「活在當下，不求長壽」信念的人，傾向迅速度過發育時期來到成人及生育的階段，速度越快越好。相反地，如從第一章所知，擁有巨大腦部的人類需要慢慢發展成熟，而且在發育階段耗費多年的時間。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;包含人類近親靈長類動物在內的大多數哺乳類動物，會經歷三個階段：嬰兒、少年與成人。他們從無法離開奶水的小毛頭，變成令人頭痛又精力旺盛的青少年，再成為發育成熟的大人。然而，正如人類通常會有的情況，我們已經脫離這個傳統的模式了。如今，人類的生命史分為五個階段：嬰兒、兒童、未成年、青少年、成人。這使我們成為獨特族羣的一員，而且可能是唯一的成員。一般認為，只有鯨魚和海豚有資格加入我們。這些物種的共通之處是腦部的體積異常龐大，因此，後代在發育成熟之前，需要更多時間成長與學習善用大腦以確保生存。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;童年時期是摸索的階段，讓我們結交朋友、克服困難、探索外在世界，還有但願能發展出對知識的熱愛。然而，在生命史的世界裡，這個階段被無趣地定義為嗷嗷待哺與獨立飲食的時期。蹣跚學步的幼兒在發育初期需要餵奶，再來需要大人餵養固體食物，相信那些曾被蘋果切片與食物攪拌機整得半死的家長們非常清楚，這就是童年階段。一開始，幫忙媽媽照顧小孩的人是女性親屬，但從五十萬年開始，如第一章提及，孩子的爸爸接下了這個角色。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;另一個獨一無二的階段是青春期。今日，在這個成長階段，孩子情緒起伏劇烈，熱中探索性吸引力、社交生活與創造力，也偏愛奇裝異服的打扮。對喬瑟夫等爸爸而言，這個機會可以讓他們深切思考，如何幫助孩子度過這段充滿挑戰的時期，好讓他們成為具有自主能力的大人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;我和父親關係很好，但其實我不太喜歡這樣，我希望他能質疑我在青春期的一些想法，但他或許有一些考量所以沒有這麼做。我希望跟孩子發展與培養一段關係，隨著他們進入青春期與開始發展個人特色，應該會產生越來越多如何面對生活中的問題、挑戰與機會的疑惑，而我希望與他們建立親近的關係，這樣才能在他們嘗試解決困難的同時展開對話。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——喬瑟夫（四歲）與裏歐（兩歲）的爸爸約翰&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;正式説來，青春期的定義是骨骼停止生長與性徵開始發育的階段。關於為什麼會出現這個階段，眾説紛紜，但最有可能的原因是，它讓人類巨大的腦部完成發展，並讓個體能夠習取重要的生存知識，不會因為求偶的強烈慾望分心。關於青少年大腦的研究顯示，其實是腦部發展飛快的時期，尤其是前額葉皮質（掌管理性思考）仍處於建構階段，表示青少年傾向在杏仁核的驅使下衝動或情緒化地回應情況，未能仔細思考最合理的行動。聽來耳熟？當母親還在處於懷孕與哺乳的無限循環中，父親在這個時期發揮十分重要的作用，負責管教孩子逾矩和負面的行為，並扮演教師與嚮導的角色。研究指出，父親對於青少年子女的發展，如同對於學步幼兒與孩童的影響一樣重要；他們的角色與行為會隨著兒女逐漸長大而有細微變化。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;青少年階段先講到這邊，我們暫時回顧一下幼年時期。從前面的章節中我們知道，父親與子女的緊密連結對健康的發展至關重要，這種關係在生命最初的一千天尤其關鍵，因為這段期間大腦正在快速發展。二○一五年，萊頓大學（Leiden University）的黎安・考克（Rianne Kok）率領一羣荷蘭科學家展開關於一百九十一名兒童的前瞻性研究，探究家長的照顧行為對孩童腦部發展有何影響。這項研究的前瞻性表示，研究人員即時追蹤孩童的發展，在受試者年僅六週大時展開研究，而不是調查過去的發展以找出關聯（即回溯性研究）。他們首先募集一羣剛出生的嬰兒，然後進行腦部超音波掃描與量測頭圍，作為研究的基準數據。之後的八年期間，除了在孩子滿一歲時評估家長與孩子玩耍時的敏感度，還有在孩子三、四歲時觀察問題解決遊戲中的親子互動之外，都沒有打擾這些家庭。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;親子互動的實驗階段過了四年，也就是這些家庭的孩子滿八歲時，再度登門拜訪，並對兒童腦部進行核磁共振掃描。藉此瞭解大腦的詳細構造，包含灰質與白質的比例。之前提過，灰質是神經元，白質則是連接神經元的軸突，使大腦的不同區域可以互相溝通。理論上，灰質越多與白質密度越高，大腦就會越「聰明」，因為它擁有越多的神經元，而神經元隨著連結增加，越能互相溝通。這樣錯縱交織的神經結構，讓我們得以展現人類物種在認知方面的彈性與複雜性。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;他們發現，父母在玩耍與問題解決活動中敏感度較高的孩子，腦部總容量大於其他兒童，因為他們大腦中的白質與灰質比較多。如同感情融洽的父母與孩子會呈現一致的催產素分泌量，寶寶從父母身上看到的正面行為，也會反映在其大腦結構。大腦中的黑質（或灰質）與白質，證明瞭家長的行為會深刻影響子女的發展。實在不可思議。在這項研究中，對孩子需求敏感的家長，實際上提供了孩子結構性的生活基礎，並且賦予他們神經架構，讓他們得以成長茁壯。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure

            <title>論語漫讀（34）：多見闕殆，慎行其餘 — 孔子是「打太極」的老祖宗</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.red-publish.com/book/2990&quot;&gt;電子書：《論語漫讀》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子張學幹祿。子曰：「多聞闕疑，慎言其餘，則寡尤；多見闕殆，慎行其餘，則寡悔。言寡尤，行寡悔，祿在其中矣」&lt;/strong&gt;（為政第二）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/96e59a8d-b10e-45af-93e8-d27e333a4851.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子張&lt;/strong&gt;，複姓顓孫、名師。子張是他的字；陳國人。他比孔子小四十八歲，與曾參年紀相仿，或者在孔子流亡陳國時入門，或者是在孔子結束流亡回到魯國後來投奔孔子的。他性情比較急躁，愛出風頭，有些像子路。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;他向孔子請教如何做官。「祿」指俸祿，「幹」是謀求，「幹祿」就是謀求俸祿，引伸開來就是如何保住官職。因為保住官職才能掙取俸祿。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;孔子針對他的毛病，回答他説，「要多聽別人的意見，不要説自己拿不準的。拿得準的意見，也要謹慎地説，這樣才能少犯錯誤；要多觀察，拿不準的先擱下，拿得準的，也要謹慎地去做，這樣才能少後悔。説話少過失，做事少後悔，就能保住官職俸祿」。 「闕」是擱置的意思，「尤」是過失，「殆」是困惑。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;孔子這段話，總的意思就是做官要少言少行，慎言慎行，明哲保身。孔子考慮到了為官的兩種情形，一種是建言建策，比如説君主或主管問事情怎麼辦？臣僚、參謀或下屬需要回答，提出自己的建議。另一種是自己是管事的，獨擋一面，需要做決斷，怎麼辦？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;中國歷史上會説話的典故比較多。例如，唐高宗李治繼位後，欲廢王皇后而改立武則天，褚遂良等元老重臣則極力反對，甚至以死相諫。但李績卻説：「此陛下家事，何必更問外人」。既不反對也不贊成。怕説錯了話事後遭來忌恨，甚至掉腦袋。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;又比如曹操捉拿到呂布後，呂布表示自己願意投降，輔佐曹操定天下。曹操卻問劉備：「何如？」劉備則回答，「公不見丁建陽、董卓之事乎？」意思是建議曹操殺掉呂布。雖然先前呂布向劉備請過情，讓他幫自己説好話，劉備也答應了。但曹操這一問，劉備領會到曹操決意要殺呂布，不管自己怎麼説，都會殺呂布。但又想借自己的口説出來，好維護自己渴求人才的名聲。劉備這時倚靠着曹操，不敢惹曹操不高興，只得順着曹操的意圖説。而劉備也沒説得很直白，而是拿呂布反叛丁原和董卓來説事。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;官場上，職責不清是常事。這也給了「多見闕殆，慎行其餘」的機會。遇着可能擔責的事，不同衙門、部門就相互推諉，俗稱「打太極」。或者實在推不開，就拖着壓着不辦，希望靠時間能拖過去。反正是「多一事不如少一事，少一事不如沒得事」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;可以説，孔子是中國官場打「太極拳」的老祖宗，講究説話含蓄，滴水不漏，辦事推諉。原因還是在於人治之下，説真話的風險太大。缺乏信任，勾心鬥角、相互傾扎，內耗嚴重。&lt;/p&gt;

rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://matters.news/@MIAzh/%E4%B8%8E%E5%BC%97%E9%87%8C%E8%BE%BE-%E9%98%BF%E6%B3%95%E9%87%8C%E4%B8%80%E8%B5%B7%E8%A7%A3%E5%BC%80%E4%BC%8A%E6%9C%97%E5%8E%86%E5%8F%B2%E7%9A%84%E7%9F%9B%E7%9B%BE-%E5%A5%B3%E6%9D%83-%E9%98%B6%E7%BA%A7%E7%9F%9B%E7%9B%BE-%E4%BC%8A%E6%96%AF%E5%85%B0%E5%8E%9F%E6%95%99%E6%97%A8%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89-%E5%B7%A6%E6%B4%BE%E9%94%99%E8%AF%AF-bafybeid5dv4rn7aqjvowgzkkvkuirmhmkopdqqkczjx4he5xe2lhmk5cla#_ftn4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;。他們明白，這些戴頭巾的命令是更多更加糟糕的事情發生的前兆。起初，一部分伊朗左翼支持這些婦女，甚至還有一些左翼男子前來示威，來保護婦女免受伊斯蘭原教旨主義者的攻擊。但即使是支持婦女示威的一部分左翼人士，也在幾天後告訴她們：「你知道的，你們應該停下來，因為這真的讓人們分心，忘了我們鬥爭的主要目標，那就是反對美帝國主義。」當這些婦女被告知應該回家的時候，這無疑是一個巨大的挫折，他們沒有得到她們所需要的支持。最近興起的「婦女、生命、自由」運動確實認為自己是那些早期婦女努力的繼承者。他們對當時站出來反對強制戴頭巾的女性感到自豪。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/be7c7099-149b-45cc-b13b-31422e5301d6.jpeg/public&quot;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;保羅·馬夏爾（PAUL MARTIAL）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 年 8 月 3 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一台腳踏車&amp;nbsp; 譯&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/88788f59-4017-4f32-9203-7b702bb85170.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;跨國公司不僅掠奪在非洲對計算機硬件的製造至關重要的自然資源，而且還在極端條件下剝削非洲大陸的工人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;人工智能（AI）的出現需要對大量數據進行下游識別，以提高其算法效率。為了執行這些任務，幾乎 90% 的高科技公司求助於外包公司。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;內容識別&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;在法語國家，摩洛哥、突尼斯或毛里求斯的公司估計可節省 30% 以上的成本，馬達加斯加可節省 50% 以上的成本。馬達加斯加擁有近 250 家 BPO（業務流程外包）機構。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;那裏的工作條件非常糟糕。法國廣播電台 RFI 報道了員工的經歷：「培訓師出現在我們身後。如果他們認為您處理簡單圖像的時間太長，他們會向您發出警告。如果第二次發生，他們會直接把你送回去。例如，如果你沒有完成一天應該做的 200 項任務，你必須繼續工作。並且這不算加班費。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;至於工資，他們的底薪約為每月 90 歐元，對於高素質的員工，最高可達 500 歐元。除了識別數據的繁瑣工作外，其他 BPO（業務流程外包）還提供審核服務。它們被 Facebook（臉書）、TikTok（抖音）、Instagram、Twitter（推特） 等主要社交網絡公司使用。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;對心理健康的危險&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sama 就是這樣一家位於肯尼亞的 BPO 公司。其員工整天都在處理極端暴力的內容，包括謀殺、酷刑和對婦女和兒童的性暴力。他們給它貼上標籤，把它輸入到社交網絡過濾器和人工智能的算法中。對他們的心理健康的後果是嚴重的，相當於創傷後應激障礙。這家肯尼亞公司從未為其員工建立過心理支持結構。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;更糟糕的是，為了用當地語言進行節制，Sama 從東非和南部非洲各國招募了年輕的畢業生，而這些畢業生往往是貧窮的。它把他們帶到了肯尼亞，卻沒有警告他們這份工作的真正性質。該公司只談到了行政工作，忽略了他們必須忍受的日常與網絡仇恨對抗的問題。一到肯尼亞，這些年輕工人就被困住了。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;抵制和組織&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;2022 年 5 月，前員工丹尼爾·莫塔恩 （Daniel Motaung） 對 Facebook 母公司 Meta 及其分包商 Sama 發起了初步投訴。投訴的重點是工作條件、薪酬問題和缺乏心理支持。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;當 Sama 停止其審核並解僱員工時，其他投訴接踵而至。肯尼亞法院已暫停解僱，等待裁決。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;與此同時，儘管僱主採取了恐嚇政策，150 名員工還是成立了第一個非洲內容審核員工會。其他員工，例如接管 TikTok 審核活動的公司 Majorel 的員工，已經宣佈他們決定加入工會。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;儘管受到主要社交網絡團體的鄙視，但版主在打擊網絡仇恨方面發揮着至關重要的作用。失敗可能會產生嚴重的後果。另一場針對 Meta 的審判正在埃塞俄比亞進行。在提格雷戰爭期間，要求謀殺居住在首都亞的斯亞貝巴的提格雷大學教授的呼籲在 Facebook 上流傳了幾天。儘管他向社交網絡進行了陳述，但消息仍在繼續流傳。他被兇手槍殺了。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;原文鏈接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article8194&quot;&gt;https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article8194&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h2&gt;取消第三世界債務委員會（CADTM）的聲明&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 年 6 月 26 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;一台腳踏車&amp;nbsp; 譯&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;摩洛哥金融交易稅收協會-取消第三世界債務委員會（ATTAC-CADTM MOROCCO）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/04349577-b694-4bc4-a421-c1614fedda04.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;賈瓦德·穆斯塔克巴爾（Jawad Mustaqbal）&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;賈瓦德·穆斯塔克巴爾（Jawad Mustaqbal）的手機被黑客入侵，他接到不明身份的人打來的威脅電話，這些人打算玷污他的聲譽，威脅他的家人，並試圖在經濟上勒索他。他們還發布了一段顯示他獨自一人赤身裸體的視頻。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這次卑鄙的襲擊是破壞我們的賈瓦德同志和摩洛哥交易稅收協會信譽的失敗企圖，他是該協會現任國家祕書處的成員。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;賈瓦德一直積極參與各種形式的聲援我國的政治犯，包括摩洛哥摩洛哥金融交易稅收協會成員奧馬爾·拉迪，他本人也面臨證明對他的政治拘留和對他判處六年徒刑是正當的誹謗和捏造骯髒指控的企圖。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;賈瓦德從小就從事反對壓迫和帝國主義的鬥爭。他是第一代加入摩洛哥金融交易稅收協會並在摩洛哥戰鬥了 20 多年的人之一。他在大眾教育方面做出了許多貢獻，並分析了帝國主義中心經濟和壓制了被壓迫者和正義的捍衞者的政治制度的征服本質。他還為摩洛哥的尊嚴和自由提出了大膽的替代方案。他參加了 2 月 20 日運動和摩洛哥所有主要的民眾運動，捍衞了他們的解放內容和基層組織形式。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我們可以理解這次卑鄙襲擊的確切目的，正是在我們看到賈瓦德積極參與組織 10 月份在馬拉喀什舉行的反對世界銀行和國際貨幣基金組織的社會運動反峯會的籌備工作的時候，針對他的聲譽。除了在摩洛哥金融交易稅收協會（Attac Morocco）中發揮作用，建立國家協調機制，作為摩洛哥反峯會的熱門基地外，他還通過在取消第三世界債務委員會（CADTM）聯合國際祕書處的成員身份，在國際、區域和大陸層面動員了眾多工作組。他所做的一切都是為了讓反峯會成為真正的國際盛會。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;賈瓦德遭受的這次襲擊反映了對他所從事的活力和動員的恐懼。肇事者的目標是停止這一活動，以便壓迫者可以在馬拉喀什慶祝他們自己的婚禮，馬拉喀什已成為世界富人的宴會廳，接待了世界上最重要的貧困和不公正的創造者，正如賈瓦德所寫的那樣。作為反峯會籌備工作的一部分，來自北非和中東的激進組織協會組織的網絡研討會也遭到了類似的卑鄙攻擊，但被成功挫敗。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這種針對活動家和戰士的骯髒攻擊和卑鄙手段破壞了他們的聲譽，這是專制政權的特徵，他們害怕任何暴露其暴政的動員。我們的同志賈瓦德·穆斯塔克巴爾（Jawad Mustaqbal）作為取消第三世界債務委員會（CADTM）和摩洛哥遭到了收協會成員遭到了的國家的攻擊。國家繼續騷擾我們的協會，並剝奪了我們續簽註冊的權利。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我們摩洛哥遭到了收協會強烈譴責針對我們的同志賈瓦德·穆斯塔克巴爾的卑鄙襲擊，以破壞他的鬥爭和信譽。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我們在此申明：&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;對他和他的家人表示絕對的聲援。&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;呼籲所有國家、地區、大陸和國際鬥爭組織擴大對賈瓦德·穆斯塔克巴爾的聲援運動，並譴責這種對活動人士的卑鄙攻擊。&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;宣佈我們決心參與在馬拉喀什舉行的反對世界銀行和國際貨幣基金組織的反峯會的籌備工作，並動員全球、大陸、區域和國家層面的廣泛參與。&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;我們表示決心繼續為另一個摩洛哥而鬥爭，一個有尊嚴、自由和社會正義的摩洛哥。&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 年 6 月 24 日&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;原文鏈接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article8142&quot;&gt;https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article8142&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>希臘婚姻平權：迴歸傳統還是時代創新</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;第四分隊長　投稿&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/a940872e-52ba-4b8d-8c52-36e19ff9cae4.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;圖、法案通過後歡慶的人羣，路透社&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;公元前 371 年，古希臘城邦底比斯和斯巴達之間爆發了一場衝突。斯巴達軍人的勇武之名，在 300 勇士誓死抵抗波斯大軍的溫泉關一戰中名留青史，而這次，底比斯組織了 300 人的聖軍從戰陣側翼包抄並徹擊退了斯巴達人，改變了古希臘歷史的走向。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;時間來到兩千多年後的 2024 年 2 月 15 日，希臘議會通過了同性婚姻法案，讓希臘迴歸了人文傳統。時任希臘總理基裏亞科斯·米佐塔基斯 (Kyriakos Mitsotakis) 在法案表決後即刻發佈公告，難掩其心中的激動，他寫道：「這是巨大的一個里程碑，反映了今天的希臘——一個進步、民主的國家。」&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;從上古神話開始，奧林匹亞諸神在選擇伴侶方面也同樣自由。宙斯、阿波羅、厄洛斯、狄俄尼索斯、赫耳墨斯、阿爾忒彌斯、雅典娜等等，故事中不不缺少同性愛情的橋段。西方哲學的奠基人之一，柏拉圖在《會飲篇》中記載他的七位門徒分別對愛神厄洛斯的頌辭；「少年是愛的最高體現。」保薩尼亞認為：「屬於天上的愛，是高尚的、值得追求的。」阿伽松認為愛是宇宙的創造者，是萬物和諧的源泉，他讚美了少年的美貌和純真，認為愛少年是愛美的體現。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;少年愛（paiderastia）正是古希臘所特有的一種同性伴侶關係，通常是一個年長的愛者（erastes）與教育、保護、愛，併為他年少的被愛者（eromenos ）提供榜樣、傳授知識和技藝，直到後者長出完整的鬍鬚，這段關係便會中止。作為底比斯執政官，伊巴密濃達想到利用這一點，便祕密集結起 150 對少年愛伴侶，讓他們接受特種軍事訓練，以擊敗斯巴達人的軍隊。《伊利亞特》裏寫下了伊巴密濃達對這些伴侶的讚頌：「愛，只有愛情的力量是無堅不摧的！再兇悍的咆哮野獸在愛的面前也只會悄悄地溜走。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/caac02bc-bc74-4807-bf27-efdf25a7b07b.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;圖、公元前 480 年記載少年愛的陶器 Wikipedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;幾乎同時期，古希臘女詩人薩福在她的詩歌《致阿那克托里亞》中寫道：「我曾以為我已經不再受愛情的折磨，但當我看到你，我的心又開始劇烈地跳動。」這首詩歌正是描寫薩福與一位女性情人的情愫，而她所居住的萊斯波島也成為了後世對女同性戀的稱謂（lesbian）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;文學、戲劇、雕塑、繪畫這些流傳千年的遺存，無不説明同性戀深入到了古希臘社會的每一處毛孔之中。此後古希臘成為羅馬帝國的一部分，文化被羅馬帝國全方位的吸收。羅馬帝國五賢帝之一的哈德良與希臘青年安提諾烏斯擁有一段同性戀情。安提諾烏斯意外身故後，哈德良終身未婚，他用各種方式紀念愛人安提諾烏斯，城市以他的名字命名，為他設立雕像至今依稀可見。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;變革發生在羅馬皇帝君士坦丁一世後，他先是頒佈了《米蘭敕令》，宣佈基督教在羅馬帝國境內合法化，並給予基督徒與其他宗教信仰者同等的權利。君士坦丁一世本人也皈依了基督教，並在臨終前接受了洗禮，這一系列事件標誌着基督教在羅馬帝國的正式確立統治地位，&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;出於平民信仰的價值觀，基督教教義中對社會中上層普遍出現的婚外情、未婚先孕、同性戀等行為視作負面。此後在希臘民間，同性戀者的身份和同性關係逐漸轉入地下，大體上相安無事。但因 1054 年東西教會分裂，帝國東部教會改稱東正教，不同於西方基督教經過了加爾文、馬丁·路得等進步學者的改革，東正教依然承襲了自中世紀以來形成的價值觀。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;東正教的宗教儀式莊嚴隆重，充滿了神祕感，同時東正教認為，聖經應該按照傳統進行解釋。教會的權威人士應該負責解釋聖經，信徒應該服從教會的權威。東正教對傳統的極端重視，到今天東正教的神職人員全部留長鬍須，頗有身體髮膚受之父母不可毀傷的意味。同時東正教會對信徒的離婚進行審查，確立了非必要不離婚的標準，以此儘量減少離婚的發生。而同性戀則被斥為徹底的異端，完全隱匿在歷史當中，至今東正教會仍是希臘內部反對同性婚姻最大的推手。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1832 年，在愛琴海岸鬥爭近 400 年後，現代希臘終於從奧斯曼土耳其的壓迫中獨立。希臘社會選擇走向現代化，同時希臘興起了啓蒙運動，推動了文化的世俗化。到 1929 年，希臘政府頒佈法令，將宗教教育從公立學校課程中剔除，這標誌着希臘走向世俗化的重要一步。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;二戰勝利後，希臘全面迴歸西方傳統，在 1951 年完成同性關係合法化（受到奧斯曼土耳其的影響，在獨立後的 1834 年刑法當中同性關係屬於犯罪行為）。西方未必只有英美，傳統未必只有耶穌，在這一點的反例正是是「第三羅馬」自居的俄羅斯，出台了各種打擊 LGBT 羣體權益的規定，美其名曰捍衞家庭價值。而希臘社會經過幾十年的現代化與世俗化以後達成的共識，兩種傳統未必要爭個高下，兩種婚姻也不須讓出存分。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9ff0268b-46d8-45a9-9fba-dfcf87409354.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;圖、米科諾斯島&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;1985 年，一羣同性戀者在創立了「阿基里斯」（Achilles）組織，這是希臘第一個性少數羣體權益組織，組織的名稱正是呼應了古希臘傳統。作為上古神話中英雄傳説的一部分，孱弱男孩帕特羅克洛斯代替愛人出征，並且戰死沙場，也讓愛他的阿基里斯為他復仇，並在死後葬在一起。二者的故事既表現了同性愛情的忠貞，也提現了古希臘人民的勇武與奮進。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿基里斯組織舉辦研討會和講座，提高公眾對同性戀的認識；出版雜誌和書籍，傳播同性戀文化；還為同性戀者提供法律援助和心理諮詢。正是有了阿基里斯這樣組織對古希臘傳統的不斷再演繹，希臘社會對同性戀和同性關係的認識不斷革新，個體之間不再是是簡單的隔空批判、站隊和扣帽子。第四國際在《論同志的解放》中指出，同志羣體的解放的路徑之一，就是充分發掘本民族文化中的同性戀傳統，而不是污名化 ta 們。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;新世紀前後，希臘的性少數羣體迎來一波小的解放。先是舉辦了 pride parade，然後是反歧視法當中加入禁止性傾向歧視的條款，這些都是希臘性少數權益運動的重要里程碑。作為支柱產業的旅遊業者也張開雙臂迎接世界各地到來的遊客，雅典、米科諾斯、塞薩洛尼基等一些希臘島嶼，成為歐洲最受歡迎的 LGBT 旅遊目的地之一。每年在雅典、塞薩洛尼基、帕特雷和克里特島首府伊拉克利翁舉行四次 pride parade。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f4318082-fb30-47f5-af8d-b6aa91aaec7c.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;圖、2022 年希臘雅典 Pride Parade NBC&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;正當希臘社會上下充滿信心地走向 21 世紀的時候，2008 年的金融海嘯席捲了這個人口剛剛超過 1000 萬的愛琴海國家。伴隨着金融海嘯的餘波，希臘政府入不敷出，並在 2010 年宣佈破產後引發了一系列的債務危機。隨後歐盟援助希臘並以自由主義的方式對希臘進行改造，手段包括削減福利開支、裁撤政府機構以及市場化的改革，這些措施導致希臘經濟陷入衰退，失業率和貧困率大幅上升。女性成為了受害者，她們當中很多人被迫成為全職主婦，理由是自然是給男人們騰出工作崗位。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2011 年，一些希臘女性自發成立了「女性反危機運動」，旨在團結女性力量，共同應對危機帶來的挑戰。另一些草根組織，如「婦女反對債務和緊縮」（Women Against Debt and Austerity），「婦女為另一種世界」（Women for Another World）等，通過網絡、小組、講座等方式，提高女性的政治意識和參與度，呼籲女性團結起來，抵制性別歧視和不平等。那一年，希臘女性們在雅典舉行了一場名為「憤怒的母親」的大規模示威遊行，以復仇三女神之一的厄裏倪厄斯之名抗議政府對女性福利的削減。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;為了度過這場危機，希臘草根組織開展了「社區診所」（Community Clinics），「社區廚房」（Community Kitchens），「社區藥房」（Community Pharmacies）等，為貧困和失業的女性提供免費的醫療、食物和藥品，緩解她們的生活困境。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;根據評估歐洲國家 LGBT 權利的 ILGA-Europe 最近進行的報告，希臘在過去十年中在 LGBT 人羣的法律和政策狀況方面取得了 49 個國家中進步最大的國家之一。希臘女性的一系列自組織運動，讓性別議題成為繼文化、地域和職業之後又一大推動社會革命的利器，藉助一系列的努力，2013 年議會選舉中女性議員的比例首次突破 30%，這在代議制民主的國家中是一個很了不起的數字。希臘女性的行動反過來促進了性別平等，更為後來的婚姻平權奠定了基礎，就在同一年，希臘最高法院裁定，禁止同性婚姻違反憲法。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2012 年的選舉中，沒有任何一個政黨或聯盟能夠贏得多數席位，但是反對緊縮政策的激進左翼聯盟（Syriza）大幅提高了得票率，從 4.6% 躍升到 16.8%，成為第二大黨。到了 2015 年，希臘再次提前舉行了議會選舉，激進左翼聯盟以 34.6% 的得票率再次贏得了第一大黨，與獨立希臘人續組聯合政府。勞工權益、福利保障、性別平等乃至婚姻平權都是左翼聯盟所關心的議題，也是歐債務機時期推動希臘草根組織互助、自助的動力之一，它們提現了社會主義運動的羣眾性、自發性與進步性。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在激進左翼聯盟執政以後，民事伴侶關係得到希臘當局的首肯，同性伴侶可以通過註冊獲得認可。與婚姻不同，民事伴侶關係的法律效力相對較弱，僅限於雙方在協議中約定的內容。如無其他規定，民事伴侶關係存續期間所得的財產，默認為各自所有；民事伴侶之間不享有法定繼承權；民事伴侶一方不能單獨收養子女等等。民事伴侶制度的出現符合現代經濟和文化條件下不同類型的伴侶雙方的需求，卻不能從根本上替代婚姻，因而導向真正的問題是，婚姻關係意味着什麼。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;總理米佐塔基斯在投票前的辯論中對議會表示：「那些一直被忽視的人最終將在我們周圍出現，與他們一起，許多人最終將找到自己應有的位置。」他説：「改革讓我們一些同胞的生活變得更好，但並沒有從許多人，的生活中奪走任何東西。」因為婚姻平權要所實現的，是完全的，不帶任何附加條件的平等。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2015 年後，希臘經濟逐漸恢復，難民問題成為受到關注的議題。2019 年 7 月，激進左翼聯盟在議會選舉中敗給了中右翼的新民主黨，齊普拉斯下台，新民主黨領導人米佐塔基斯成為新的總理。後者在應對新冠疫情和與土耳其的東地中海爭端方面表現出積極的態度，與歐盟國家加強了合作和關係。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/bff43983-f5d5-4aa0-a85b-ee6a38ae660e.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;圖、議會外抗議立法的羣眾的 BBC&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;米佐塔基斯有意推動進行婚姻平權的改革，但不是所有人都支持。表決的時候許多人在首都憲法廣場打出橫幅、舉起十字架、朗誦祈禱文並唱誦《聖經》中的段落。東正教教會領袖伊羅尼莫斯大主教表示，這項措施將「破壞祖國的社會凝聚力」。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;最終 254 名議員參加了投票，176 票贊成，76 票反對，Metron Analysis 最近進行的一項民意調查顯示，儘管 62% 的受訪者表示支持同性婚姻，但 69% 的受訪者反對同性生育。激進左翼聯盟主席索克拉蒂斯·法梅洛（Sokratis Famello）的發言引起了強烈反響，他在議會發言中強調，「歷史將銘記，新民主黨沒有足夠的能力推進改革」。 「激進左翼聯盟議會集團已經證明，它長期以來一直支持婚姻平等改革，而激進左翼聯盟政府 2015-2019 年期間的立法已經鋪平了道路。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;新的法案還賦予同性伴侶收養權，這在很大程度上緩解希臘人口出生率低下的問題。40 歲的歷史學家尼科斯·尼古拉迪斯 (Nikos Nikolaidis) 表示：「這對於人權來説是非常重要的一步，對於平等來説是非常重要的一步，對於希臘社會來説也是非常重要的一步。」希臘跨性別者支持協會成員埃爾米娜·帕帕迪瑪 (Ermina Papadima) 表示：「作為一名希臘公民，我感到非常自豪，因為希臘現在實際上是最進步的國家之一。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;參考資料&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wikipedia：LGBT rights in Greece&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;路透社：Greece legalises same sex marriage in landmark change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBC：Greece legalises same-sex marriage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Athens Embraces its Queer History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Left Must Link With Progressive Forces in Middle East to Stop Regional War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;﹝伊朗﹞弗裏達·阿法裏（Frieda Afary）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2024 年 2 月 8 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;米勒，譯&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/84a6970a-f402-4737-92a4-805581d7eb75.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;在林肯紀念堂舉行的紀念瑪莎·日娜·阿米尼（Mahsa Zhina Amini）和示威者的燭光守夜活動中，透過照片中展示的被伊朗政權殺害的抗議者的照片，可以看到華盛頓紀念碑。該活動標誌着阿米尼被謀殺一週年，也是「婦女、生命、自由」運動的開始。Ali Khaligh / Middle East images / Middle East images via Afp via getty images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;伊朗和美國的進步人士必須橫向聯繫起來，抵制軍國主義，因為我們的領導人正在將他們的威脅逐步升級。&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;自 2023 年 10 月 7 日哈馬斯對以色列發動野蠻襲擊，以及以色列對加沙發動種族滅絕式的入侵以來，在美國政府不願呼籲立即停火的背景下，關於中東地區可能爆發地區戰爭的説法不絕於耳。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;作為一名與伊朗、美國、以色列和巴勒斯坦的活動家有聯繫的美籍伊朗社會主義女權主義活動家，這些事態發展讓我感到震驚，既因為純粹的暴行和無辜生命的喪失，也因為真正進步人士的聲音被扼殺。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 月 2 日，美國在伊拉克和敍利亞對伊朗軍隊和伊朗支持的民兵組織進行了軍事打擊，造成包括平民在內的 39 人死亡；2 月 7 日，美國對巴格達的襲擊導致一名伊朗支持的民兵組織高級領導人及其兩名護衞人員死亡，一場更廣泛的戰爭可能正在向我們襲來。美國最近一次襲擊是對伊朗支持的伊拉克民兵對美國駐約旦基地的無人機襲擊的迴應，該襲擊造成三名美國士兵死亡，數十人受傷。伊朗政府則警告稱將採取反報復行動。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;美國和英國還對也門的胡塞武裝發動了新一輪打擊，以迴應胡塞武裝在紅海對商船和軍用船隻的襲擊。胡塞武裝則聲稱，他們發動襲擊是為了聲援巴勒斯坦人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;伊朗及其民兵針對美國在該地區目標的無人機和導彈襲擊已持續數年，這是伊朗政府數十年來努力證明自己是一個地區大國的一部分。伊朗政府向哈馬斯、伊拉克什葉派民兵、也門胡塞武裝、黎巴嫩真主黨和敍利亞巴沙爾·阿薩德政府提供軍事、後勤和其他援助。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;與此同時，美國每年向以色列提供 38 億美元的軍事援助，向沙特阿拉伯、埃及和其他阿拉伯政權出售武器，並在該地區擁有軍事基地，包括在卡塔爾、巴林、科威特、沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯聯合酋長國的基地，以及其他地方小型的前哨基地。2001 年至 2021 年，美軍佔領了阿富汗。2003 年至 2011 年，美軍還佔領了伊拉克。俄羅斯也是該地區——包括伊朗、沙特阿拉伯和土耳其在內的——多個國家的主要武器供應國。俄羅斯在敍利亞擁有一個海軍基地以及一些地面部隊。它還支持伊朗生產導彈和無人機——俄羅斯在入侵烏克蘭時使用了其中的一些武器。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;四十多年來，伊朗伊斯蘭共和國一直利用反猶太主義及其反對美帝國主義和以色列佔領的立場，作為促進其區域帝國主義野心的手段，其中涉及經濟、意識形態和戰略目標，並導致對該地區工人階級和被壓迫人民的剝削。2018 年，魯哈尼總統在一次公開演講中明確表示，伊朗的戰略邊界是東面的印度次大陸、北面的高加索、南面的紅海和西面的地中海。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;然而，在 1979 年伊斯蘭共和國成立之前，以色列對巴勒斯坦人民的攻擊及其拒絕承認巴勒斯坦人的自決權的行為，已經製造了該地區不斷惡化的創傷之一。對巴勒斯坦土地長達 56 年的佔領反過來又為該地區的獨裁統治者提供了一個外部敵人，用來掩蓋每個國家都存在的階級剝削、父權制、種族主義以及其他形式的偏見和統治等內部矛盾。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在 2011 年「阿拉伯之春」、2011 年的敍利亞起義以及 2019 年蘇丹、阿爾及利亞、伊拉克、黎巴嫩和伊朗的抗議浪潮中，世界開始看到中東和北非的民眾開始挑戰其中的一些內部矛盾。然而，這些努力都遭到了專制政權的鎮壓。阿薩德政權——殘酷鎮壓了 2011 年的敍利亞起義，其監獄中關押着 10 多萬人，有記錄表明那裏發生了工業規模的酷刑——繼續聲稱其支持巴勒斯坦人，但事實上，它鎮壓了敍利亞境內捍衞 2011 年起義的巴勒斯坦人。同樣聲稱捍衞巴勒斯坦人自決權的阿拉伯、伊朗和土耳其統治者，卻因為庫爾德人的自決要求，殘酷鎮壓其國內的庫爾德人。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2022 年秋天在伊朗興起的「婦女、生命、自由」運動是整個地區的希望燈塔。抗議數月並被逮捕、殺害、致盲和強姦的婦女和男子不僅要求結束強制性佩戴頭巾。他們還要求婦女有權控制自己的身體，有權接受基於批判性思維的教育，結束死刑，被壓迫的少數民族的權利和勞工權利。他們反對宗教原教旨主義、性別/國家暴力、軍國主義和帝國主義，呼籲與該地區其他國家和平共處。這場運動參與者的各種聲明呼籲打破該地區獨裁政權所利用的種族、宗教和性別劃分。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在 2023 年 10 月獲得諾貝爾和平獎的伊朗女權主義人權活動家納爾吉斯·穆罕默迪（Narges Mohammadi）的不懈努力中，也可以體現「婦女、生命、自由」運動的積極內容。除了美國筆會要求釋放她的請願書之外，西方媒體對她的報道幾乎沒有，很少有英文報道提到她在獄中發表的關於巴勒斯坦和以色列的聲明，該聲明譴責「襲擊無家可歸者、屠殺兒童、婦女和平民、劫持人質、（以及）轟炸醫院、學校和居民區。」穆罕默迪呼籲「立即停火，結束戰爭……尊重人權，為各國人民的和平共處創造條件。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;面對穆罕默迪等女權主義者的持續反抗，監獄、學校和街頭青年的反抗，以及工人、教師、護士、少數民族、退休人員和殘疾人的反抗，伊朗政府加大了鎮壓力度。它實施了《頭巾和貞潔法》，嚴厲加重了對沒有佩戴「適當頭巾」的婦女的懲罰。伊朗處決了更多的庫爾德、俾路支和阿拉伯青年，包括在「婦女、生命、自由」抗議活動中被捕的青年。伊朗的死刑率僅次於中國，位居世界第二。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;伊朗監獄內外的持不同政見者輪番絕食以抗議死刑。絕食者、女權主義者和其他持不同政見者給聯合國人權事務副高級專員娜達·納西弗（Nada al-Nashif）撰寫公開信，要求她取消伊朗之行，因為她將不被允許會見政治犯和被處決者的家屬。她還將被迫戴上頭巾。給納西弗撰寫公開信的簽名者希望她等待聯合國實情調查團關於伊朗政府對「婦女、生命、自由」抗議者實施謀殺和強姦的調查結果。但她卻一意孤行，並宣佈此行不是探訪囚犯及其家屬的實情調查團，而是與伊斯蘭共和國官員會面的正式行程。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;伊朗國內的進步力量並沒有要求西方國家進行正式訪問，會見政府領導人，也沒有要求美國進行軍事幹預。他們正在橫向聯繫全球的基層進步力量，在反對軍國主義、獨裁主義和宗教原教旨主義的鬥爭中爭取道義和物質上的支持。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;鑑於當前的戰爭動向和美國與伊朗之間的對抗加劇，對於那些反對美帝國主義和以色列對加沙的戰爭，反對美國在該地區的襲擊、要求加沙停火以及並捍衞伊朗正在進行的爭取婦女權利和人權鬥爭的人來説，這一點極為重要。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;伊朗的進步活動家正在努力反對死刑和大規模監禁，捍衞婦女控制自己身體的權利，捍衞庫爾德人、俾路支人和阿拉伯少數民族以及宗教少數羣體（如伊朗的巴哈伊教徒和阿富汗移民）的權利。他們正在向——那些正在抵抗塔利班和其他宗教原教旨主義勢力的——阿富汗婦女伸出援手。他們的工作對於扭轉中東的趨勢，使其擺脫專制主義和戰爭至關重要。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;贊同這些目標的美國進步人士可以首先加入釋放納爾吉斯·穆罕默迪和所有政治犯的呼籲。但更廣泛地説，他們可以將這些鬥爭與美國反對性別和國家暴力的運動、反對大規模監禁的監獄廢奴運動、爭取生育權和墮胎權的運動以及正在進行的反對軍國主義的鬥爭橫向聯繫起來。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;原文鏈接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://truthout.org/articles/us-left-must-link-with-progressive-forces-in-middle-east-to-stop-regional-war/&quot;&gt;https://truthout.org/articles/us-left-must-link-with-progressive-forces-in-middle-east-to-stop-regional-war/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>阿列克謝·納瓦爾尼獄中被殺│Alexei Navalny killed in prison</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;俄羅斯社會主義運動（Russian Socialist Movement）的聲明&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2024 年 2 月 17 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;管同志，譯&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/5eafb251-7201-4e38-9d8b-c9a5d308f866.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;阿列克謝·納瓦爾尼在監獄中被殺。聯邦監獄部門報告了這位政治家的死亡，但明顯他並非自殺，而是被弗拉基米爾·普京殺害的。納瓦爾尼的反腐敗調查和運動動員了數百萬俄羅斯人的政治性，並激勵了數千名積極社會活動家——其中的許多人並不同意他的政治觀點，但相信變革俄羅斯的可能性。 他和他的組織——反腐敗基金會——在 2021 年前都能夠組織大規模的反普京集會。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;納瓦爾尼是俄羅斯民粹主義的創始人之一，即使有着其右翼資歷，它也傾向於質疑寡頭資本主義，引起人們對俄羅斯貧困和不平等的關注，並將普通俄羅斯民眾和富到離譜的、通過篡權、腐敗、獲取公共資金和財產、酷刑、謀殺和戰爭獲取鉅額財富的俄羅斯國家統治集團劃分開來。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;普京害怕納瓦爾尼。他的暗殺是一個明確的政治信號，表明普京主義正在進入一個新階段，已經能夠從實際生活中消滅政治對手，甚至可能消滅任何被認為對政權的生存構成威脅的人。這意味着俄羅斯所有政治犯的生命都處於危險之中。我們必然能預見到俄羅斯境內外的暴力升級以及政治活動家更多的「意外」死亡。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;普京嗜血的政權想要通過殺害納瓦爾尼來削弱俄羅斯反對派的積極性。我們必須反其期望而行之。為了結束獨裁統治，我們必須加強團結性和自我組織性。納瓦爾尼之死是一個政治殉難的例子，它應當是對我們後續的政治行動的激勵，而不是對我們的挫敗。 我們決不能放棄。殺人犯將會受到懲罰，獨裁政權將會被推翻。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;原文鏈接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/russocmovement/posts/pfbid0Xo7PaiSFvF8X6g6xmDP466USViTV6vW2uSgbuyywG9enFwVwKQ4hg1Le3s5LnEo8l&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/russocmovement/posts/pfbid0Xo7PaiSFvF8X6g6xmDP466USViTV6vW2uSgbuyywG9enFwVwKQ4hg1Le3s5LnEo8l&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>關注非洲的森林│In Africa, focus on the forests</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;﹝法國﹞保羅·馬夏爾（Paul Martial）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 年 8 月 1 日&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;馬城　譯、日土兀　校&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/77fe572d-b74a-440e-a7f6-cef4d9df6134.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;非洲和其他大陸一樣，正面臨着森林覆蓋率的減少，這是發展出口農業和伐木業擴張的結果，其中大部分活動是非法的。非洲的森林正受到非洲大陸土地加速商業化的威脅。雖然重點往往是中非赤道上的森林，但薩赫勒-撒哈拉地帶以下和南部非洲大部分地區的乾旱森林面臨着更嚴重的危機。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;非洲森林面臨危險&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;在殖民時期，森林以特許形式被開採。在這種制度下，殖民國家將其所有特權轉讓給私人公司。這些公司種植出口作物，如可可、咖啡、橡膠、棕櫚油等，對森林造成損害。當非洲國家獲得獨立後，這種農業經濟模式繼續存在。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;結果，幾十年來，森林被大量砍伐。科特迪瓦就是一個很好的例子。在 1900 年至 2021 年期間，該國 80% 的森林消失了，主要是由於可可出口。和亞馬遜一樣，非洲的森林能進行大量的碳封存。剛果森林儲存了 500 億噸碳。它們有助於調節氣候，是許多動植物物種的家園。對近 1 億人來説，它們也是食物、藥物和建築材料的直接或間接來源。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;盜採森林資源非法獲利&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;由於森林的市場化，非洲每年有近 400 萬公頃的森林消失。這採取了通過政策掠奪土地的形式，使大型跨國公司受益，同時與非洲國家領導人共謀。其目的是發展出口農業和採礦業務。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;另一個加劇森林砍伐的因素是木材貿易。由於亞洲市場的強勁需求，非法採伐呈爆炸式增長。這意味着非洲大陸損失了 170 億美元。例如，在烏幹達，非法砍伐的木材佔木材總量的 80%。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;走私的發生離不開政客與高級官員的同謀。2019 年，加蓬林業部長蓋伊-伯特蘭·馬潘古（Guy-Bertrand Mapangou）涉嫌販運珍貴木材。在贊比亞，與前總統埃德加·倫古（Edgar Lungu）關係密切的人也捲入了類似的事件。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;「對使用者友善」的保護&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;迫於國際壓力，非洲各國政府紛紛出台法律措施保護本國森林。但成效甚微，主要是因為缺乏資源，也由於腐敗。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這些政策鼓勵森林社區參與這種貿易，社區成員更願意從這筆意外之財中獲益，而不是僅僅做一個旁觀者。社區所處的不穩定的土地保有情況不鼓勵他們從事可持續的林業活動。正如一位社區領袖所説:「這些公司進來，在沒有徵求我們意見的情況下經營我們的森林，當我們抗議時，他們拿出一份官方文件，聲稱他們有權這樣做。雖然這些森林毫無疑問是屬於我們，但是我們無能為力。」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;保護森林的最好辦法是讓它們處於社區的控制之下。這意味着確保他們的土地所有權和尊重他們的生活方式。正如一位土著領袖所説:「我們在森林裏生活了幾千年，一直在可持續地利用它。」事實上，獲得執行的項目清單顯示，這些資源正在得到保護，這是科學家們所謂的「愉快保護」的結果。換句話説，人與自然和諧相處，與目前普遍存在的過度開發和掠奪森林資源相去甚遠。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;原文鏈接：&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article8191&quot;&gt;https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article8191&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.red-publish.com/book/2990&quot;&gt;電子書：《論語漫讀》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子曰：「由！誨女知之乎？知之為知之，不知為不知，是知也」&lt;/strong&gt;（為政第二）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/d0bed9ee-224a-436d-9ffb-3ef3d2d10530.jpeg/public&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;由，仲由，字子路。魯國人，孔子早年弟子，名列孔門十哲和七十二賢。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;子路年齡與孔子差得不多，只比孔子小九歲。據史記記載，「子路性鄙，好勇力，志伉直」，還曾向孔子動拳頭。但被孔子以禮折服，才拜孔子為師。孔子大約 30 歲左右開始講學，那麼子路拜孔子為師時至少 21 歲了。年紀越大，可塑性就越小。性格很難改變，學習能力可能也不如其他又年輕又聰慧的弟子。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;説來説去，子路愛出頭。有什麼事情，總是自告奮勇。孔子周遊列國的旅途中，都有賴子路當開路先鋒；學習中有什麼問題，他肯定也憋不住要提出來；或者孔子提問時，他不求甚解，不假思索地就搶先問答。但又沒有理解透，結果沒答對。不像顏回那樣沉得住氣，給孔子面子。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;所以，孔子訓斥他，「子路呀，我不是告訴過你什麼叫知道嗎？知道是知道，不知道為不知道，要分得清楚自己知道什麼，不知道什麼，這才是知道」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;蘇格拉底曾説，「我擁有的知識越多,我越覺得無知」。與孔子這句話有些類似。就是知道自己的無知才算是真正的知道。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;通常，孔子的話是學生問，他作答。但這段話，卻是孔子劈頭蓋臉朝子路一通訓斥。肯定是惹得孔子很不高興。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;《論語》中還有兩處，孔子直呼子路的名字，同是教訓的口吻。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子曰：由，知德者鮮矣！&lt;/strong&gt;（衞靈公第十五）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這句訓導與「知之為知之」契合。可能子路自以為知德，但孔子認為他其實並沒有真正瞭解，所以這麼訓斥他。「仲由呀！這世上知道仁德的人少得可憐！你其實也不知道，不要裝着知道，還是老老實實繼續跟我學習吧！」&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子曰：「由也！女聞六言六蔽矣乎？」對曰：「未也。」「居！吾語女。好仁不好學，其蔽也愚。好知不好學，其蔽也蕩。好信不好學，其蔽也賊。好直不好學，其蔽也絞。好勇不好學，其蔽也亂。好剛不好學，其蔽也狂」&lt;/strong&gt;（陽貨第十七）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;仁、知、信、直、勇和剛，看來這六者都是子路所好，但孔子卻認為子路不怎麼好學。所以孔子諄諄教導他不好好學習的話，他追求修煉的品德品質也不會有好效果。「愛好仁德而不愛學習，弊病是容易受人矇騙；愛好耍聰明而不愛學習，弊病是沒有根本；聽信他人而不愛學習，弊病是害了自己；性子直率卻不愛學習，弊病是説話輕率；喜歡爭強好勝卻不愛學習，容易目無尊長；為人倔強卻不愛學習，弊病是狂妄自大」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但子路有個優點，勇於踐行，知行合一。知道了，就立馬去做。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;子路有聞，未之能行，唯恐有聞&lt;/strong&gt;（公冶長第五）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;子路從孔子那裏聞知一個做人的道理後，還未能做到，唯恐再聞知新的道理。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;子路有聞，不言而喻，是從孔子那裏聞知做人的道理。或者直接聽孔子講，或聽同學轉述。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這説明子路對自己要求很高，聞知一個道理後，就急於去做。如果自己做不到，就會產生內心衝突和焦慮。因而惟恐再聞知一個道理，怕自己也做不到，徒增煩惱。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;這是正話反説，「&lt;strong&gt;唯恐有聞」&lt;/strong&gt;似乎批評子路不愛求問，但實際是在讚揚子路非常重視行動，自己認為對的，就一定要去踐行，併到達要求。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但&lt;strong&gt;「知之為知之，不知為不知」&lt;/strong&gt;並不意味着要慎於表達。如果什麼事情都要考慮周全萬無一失無懈可擊才説出自己和意見，也不見得可取。通過集體討論，拋磚引玉和相互啓發，集思廣益將更有利於認識問題和解決問題。&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>該怎樣教？</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;該怎樣教？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liqiu Wang 王立秋 &lt;strong&gt;2024-03-16 13:26&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;上個月，亞當·科茨科 (Adam Kotsco) 在&lt;strong&gt;Slate&lt;/strong&gt;上發表了一篇文章，討論學生讀寫能力——一個在大學課堂上被視之為當然的東西——的消失。他説一直以來，他為每節課指定的閲讀材料大概都在 30 頁左右，根據閲讀材料的難易程度有所增減。但近年來他發現的一個問題是，超過 10 頁的材料就會讓學生覺得受不了，要求學生把握一篇 20 頁左右的論文中的論證更是變成了不可能完成的任務。在確認這不只是一個個別問題、或自我感覺良好的一代人對下一代人的習慣性抱怨後，他推測，學生讀寫能力的消失可能有三方面的原因，一是數字技術尤其是手機的普及，尤其是，現在，我們在課堂上面對的是完全在智能手機陪伴下長大的一代人（當然，説的主要是歐美的情況，且暫不考慮數字鴻溝的影響）；二是疫情；三是教學方式，主要體現為以考試-指標化考覈為取向的、受某些流行教育理論（如平衡讀寫理論）影響的教學方式。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;我相信這篇文章一定會引起任何扮演過教師角色的人的共鳴和思考（由於作者與 Slate 簽了三個月內不得授權其他地方轉發的合同，我暫時無法直接譯介這篇短文，有興趣的讀者可以到 slate 上搜索「The Loss of Things I Took for Granted」）。它也提醒我注意到了自己一直以來的一個思維盲區：作為一個成天把 relexivity 和反思掛在嘴上的人，在這方面，我卻真的只是在「抱怨」和被動地「迎合」、而沒有主動地思考「為什麼學生不讀書」這個問題。然而只要稍加思索就不難發現，這個問題和很多看似與眼下現實聯繫不那麼緊密的問題是相關的。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;在引申之前，我想簡要評述亞當的論述。他提到的第一、二點，在我看來影響不全是負面的，這涉及到關於數字技術/媒介的利弊之爭、可供性、對人潛能的限制/激發等的討論（這裏適合引用丹尼爾·米勒的一個論述：「和使用像後人類或跨人類那樣的術語相反，我們可以把人定義為一個包含每一種新技術實現的潛在因素的存在」）。當然也就像他指出的那樣，這部分多少也是我們無能為力的，我們能爭取改變的，是對這個環境、氛圍、條件的反應，也就是我們的教學方式。我完全同意他的這個判斷，只是想補充指出，看似完全取決於我們的教學方式，本身也有結構的一面。它和測量、指標化、審計、考覈是相關的，甚至再進一步加以引申，和數字技術背後的「數字思維」也是相關的（關於與「模擬」相對的「數字」思維模式，參見亞歷山大·加洛韋教授為我們編選的數字與模擬專題，這組文章將刊載於《智能社會研究》即將出版的第 6 期，敬請關注）。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但在這裏先不談更哲學、更理論、更思想史的那個部分，讓我們先來思考一下「學生不讀書」的政治經濟結構因素。我首先想到的是自讀到起就一直放在心裏的，子安宣邦關於「學」之復權的討論。對此，戶倉恆信在為《思想史家重讀的論語：「學」的復權》（簡中版本譯作《孔子的學問——日本人如何讀〈論語〉》）撰寫的書評中做出了很好的引申：「現代教育的偏執是，始終不讓學子們積極思考，所謂不參加、不出席、不發表，這些消極行為上才需要其自主性的抉擇。很奇妙的是，從幼稚園到研究所，這些機構的主宰者只對於‘能為而為’盲目地加以評分，而不去思考‘能為而不為’裏含有的積極意涵。……這種‘學制’的存在已經證明瞭，學子們對於這活動感受不到‘學’的存在」(p. 287)。當「教」被固化、吸納為體制架構的一部分，旨在灌輸均一化的「正確」的時候，「學」就變成了名義上正確但事實上不被鼓勵的抵抗。事實上，真正對系統內教育有所體會的人也清楚，這個名義上被鼓勵的行動，也被鼓勵只停留在表面上——你最好表演學，而不要真的去學。（相應的，你最好表演教，而不是真去教似乎早就是文化的一部分了，參見徐浩峯的各種電影。）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但是什麼刺破了相互配合的泡沫，使學生不通過學的抵抗去擺脫學的表象，而是轉向懶惰/擺爛/冷漠/不配合/不理會/不迴應/不在乎的態度呢？事實上，這種不配合背後有一種寂靜的絕望。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;馬克·費舍《資本主義現實主義》中的《反身性無能與止動》一章，對這個現象做出了敏鋭的診斷。「這種聽天由命既不是冷漠也不是犬儒，而是反身性無能。他們知道情況不妙，但更重要的是，他們知道自己對此無能為力。」這在某種程度上是一種對無比強大的現實、結構採取了一種怠惰的態度，就費舍觀察到的英國學生而言，這種態度促使學生們轉向了一種「抑鬱的快樂」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;但我們這裏不一樣，畢竟，與在實際教學互動中遭遇的「消極」相反，事實上，我們的學生似乎更加「積極」的「卷」起來了。説到底，規訓結構的轉變彷彿更多地激發了學生們的新自由主義主體性。「學」被拋棄了看起來僅僅是因為它「無用」。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;的確，如果要學習怎樣混學界，拋棄課堂直接去接受大缸式的學術公務員培訓不好嗎？如果要滿足考覈指標，以比課堂高效的方式速成不好嗎？如果要佔有知識，直接購買不好嗎？如果一定要接受灌輸，B 站不好麼？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;於是這似乎又回到了課堂上應該提供什麼的問題，在明面上的功能失效並已經可以徹底被各種「黑市」取代的情況下，課堂還能提供什麼其他地方沒有的東西？&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;也許是某種無法被指標化、被顯性化、被捕捉的東西。在我看來，那就是學，而如果學不能被以主動的、積極的方式教授的話，那麼，課堂能提供的，至少是「學」的示範——教育者不能只表演教，也必須展示學——至多則是對「學」的親歷，在一定程度上讓學生去親歷學習，親歷閲讀、理解、思考、分析的過程。&lt;/p&gt;
