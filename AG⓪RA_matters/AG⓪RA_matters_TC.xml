                <![CDATA[<p>用這句話當標題啊，實在是覺得有點兒不雅，加上，刻薄。但又很難抵擋得了誘惑你説咋辦？最後只好把萬千寵愛給了自己，管它後來洪水滔天。</p><p>這話也不是我的原創，是我從一篇微博的評論區抄來的。就是那篇關於班宇、陳春成、淡豹等著名作家考編的微博。一大早醒來看到消息，不知道為什麼硬是從一干人名裏看到了個不存在的雙雪濤。大概是我前兩天才讀了他的長篇處女作《翅鬼》的緣故，讀完感慨，稚嫩是當然的了，然而自由之精神那時候就有了。而班宇和陳春成，不自覺被我歸類和雙雪濤同一種類型，雖然我都沒讀過班宇的任何作品。可能因為我聽説過的班宇也是東北人，也愛寫下崗潮。而陳春成，也得過寶珀理想國文學獎。我對淡豹的瞭解很有限，我只記得她當過《隨機波動》的嘉賓，至於講了什麼，沒留下印象。但那也是隨機波動啊！</p><p>一個，一批，字裏行間閃爍自由之光的作家，竟然主動委身體制，你説還有比「歸來還是喜歡爸爸的大編制」這話更能表達讀者的失望之情的嗎？</p><p>還好最後證明我眼花，那裏頭沒有雙雪濤。我大概只看到個「雪」字就發了狂，那其實是淡豹的真名，她叫劉雪婷。她很慘，沒考上，卻不得不和金榜題名的另兩位一起承受嘲笑。除了家人親戚，也不知道有沒有人同情她。</p><p>班宇的《冬泳》，我甚至有次在書店差點買下來。但班宇離我最近時，是今年熱播的國產劇《漫長的季節》，他是這部劇的文學策劃。我不知道文學策劃是幹啥的，原來以為是編劇，後來看報道，這劇的編劇另有其人。但《漫長的季節》這個名字，來自於班宇的同名短篇小説。劇集裏王陽在鐵軌上給沈默讀的那首詩，《漫長的》，也是班宇寫的。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/5b2bf3e1-c9e0-4de5-90b9-735d52e027cb.webp/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>這詩的感覺真好，在劇裏它是王陽寫的，雖然有我有點不信，就像現在我也有點難以相信他是班宇寫的一樣。</p><p>最讓我失望的，其實還是陳春成。我讀過他的《夜晚的潛水艇》，驚為天人，還寫過讀後感。在那本書裏，陳春成寫的很多故事都讓我誤以為他和雙雪濤一樣，對於現實，牢騷滿腹，卻只能和着血吞。不信你看看，他在《裁雲記》裏講説某個城市因為元首的一句玩笑話説雲彩破破爛爛，城市管理者立馬成立了《雲彩管理局》，隨時修剪雲彩。他在《音樂家》裏，講了個蘇聯故事，一位克格勃的音樂審查員，本身擁有天才的創作能力，但一直被恐懼壓制，直到有一天，他「感到靈魂中激起一圈圈波紋，應和着樂聲，漩動成渦流，不知要往哪傾瀉……」，他決定放飛自我，成為一隻椋鳥。</p><blockquote><p>説是上帝每造出一隻椋鳥，就造出一段旋律，和它靈魂的形狀完全一致，藏在世間某處，讓這鳥去尋找。也許在泉流中，也許在樹梢的搖盪中，也許正盤旋在某個人的腦子裏。椋鳥終日亂叫，探索着新的調子，也學它聽來的任何聲音，就是為找它的旋律。一旦被它偶然唱出，椋鳥的形體就會立時化作灰燼，而它的靈魂就鑽進那旋律裏，再也不出來了……</p></blockquote><p>陳春成是 90 年生人，《夜晚的潛水艇》是他迄今為止唯一出版物。讀完之後，我一直期待他的新作，直到昨天。</p><p>我猜，一個需要整天打卡「學習強國」掙學分的人，是很難寫出飄逸文字，也很難再成為椋鳥了。就算有天他寫出同樣的故事來，也好像沒辦法説服我了。</p><p>有個詞想送給陳春成：英年早事。</p><p></p><pre><code>陳春成作品彈幕：</code></pre><blockquote><p>上頭希望藉助你的力量，復原《紅樓夢》，當然要在儘量保持作品原貌的同時加以修正，去其糟粕，注入新時代的正能量。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>我斷斷續續唸了出來：揭示了腐朽的封建社會必然滅亡的命運……</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>「《紅樓夢》沒有中心思想，因為它就是一切的中心；也無法從中提取出意義，因為它本身就是宇宙的意義。」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>紅學會將二者的理論與對《紅樓夢》的崇拜融合起來，形成了他們的教義：他們相信宇宙的意義就是《紅樓夢》。教義宣稱，冥冥中有一條引線，由所有人的命運共同編織而成，它從天地開闢前的混沌中發端，隱祕地盤繞在萬事萬物之間，千秋萬載地延伸。創世之初它就被點燃，火星不斷向前推進，穿過歷朝歷代，一直燒到《紅樓夢》完成的那一刻（他們稱之為紅點），然後，轟隆，宇宙達到最輝煌燦爛的頂點。此後就是漫長的下坡、緩慢的衰亡：《紅樓夢》一完成便開始流逝，到它徹底消失時，宇宙亦將隨之泯滅。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>襲春寒告訴過我，全球的天空上逡巡着萬千青鳥，它們監控一切，也是極具殺傷力的武器；在城市上空還作為移動廣播，時刻宣傳焦大同的豐功偉績。</p></blockquote>

However, he was limited by the two-dimensional realm, and many concepts couldn't be fully translated onto paper.</p><p>(§ 22 How I then tried to diffuse the Theory of Three Dimensions by other means, and of the result)</p><blockquote><p>So I devoted several months in privacy to the composition of a treatise on the mysteries of Three Dimensions. Only, with the view of evading the Law, if possible, I spoke not of a physical Dimension, but of a Thoughtland whence, in theory, a Figure could look down upon Flatland and see simultaneously the insides of all things, and where it was possible that there might be supposed to exist a Figure environed, as it were, with six Squares, and containing eight terminal Points. But in writing this book I found myself sadly hampered by the impossibility of drawing such diagrams as were necessary for my purpose: for of course, in our country of Flatland, there are no tablets but Lines, and no diagrams but Lines, all in one straight Line and only distinguishable by difference of size and brightness; so that, when I had finished my treatise (which I entitled, 「Through Flatland to Thoughtland」) I could not feel certain that many would understand my meaning.</p></blockquote><p>A-Square repackaged certain three-dimensional concepts using two-dimensional language, presenting them in a way that seemed less risky and easily understandable, yet not completely devoid of their original meaning.</p><p>However, A-Square still felt that writing constrained his expression, and he was uncertain if people would accurately grasp some of his intended meanings.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/3ddac58a-e796-428d-ab54-1a2dc2b867a4.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Zeal</strong></h3><p>Despite A-Square's intention to maintain a low profile and silently spread the gospel, he inadvertently exposed his dangerous thoughts.</p><p>(§ 22 How I then tried to diffuse the Theory of Three Dimensions by other means, and of the result)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart">And yet at times my spirit was too strong for me, and I gave vent to dangerous utterances.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Already I was considered heterodox if not treasonable, and I was keenly alive to the danger of my position; nevertheless I could not at times refrain from bursting out into suspicious or half-seditious utterances, even among the highest Polygonal or Circular society.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When, for example, the question arose about the treatment of those lunatics who said that they had received the power of seeing the insides of things, I would quote the saying of an ancient Circle, who declared that prophets and inspired people are always considered by the majority to be mad; and I could not help occasionally dropping such expressions as 「the eye that discerns the interiors of things,」 and 「the all-seeing land」; once or twice I even let fall the forbidden terms 「the Third and Fourth Dimensions.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>At last, to complete a series of minor indiscretions, at a meeting of our Local Speculative Society held at the palace of the Prefect himself,—some extremely silly person having read an elaborate paper exhibiting the precise reasons why Providence has limited the number of Dimensions to Two, and why the attribute of omnividence is assigned to the Supreme alone—I so far forgot myself as to give an exact account of the whole of my voyage with the Sphere into Space, and to the Assembly Hall in our Metropolis, and then to Space again, and of my return home, and of everything that I had seen and heard in fact or vision.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>At first, indeed, I pretended that I was describing the imaginary experiences of a fictitious person; but my enthusiasm soon forced me to throw off all disguise, and finally, in a fervent peroration, I exhorted all my hearers to divest themselves of prejudice and to become believers in the Third Dimension.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>And then, as expected, A-Square was imprisoned.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/4b4778ca-4306-4214-b167-b974dc1a6c4b.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p></p><h3>The Memoir</h3><p>In prison, A-Square encountered his own brother. Despite A-Square's brother witnessing the entire process of the sphere's "coming" and subsequently being silenced and imprisoned, he still doubted everything A-Square said. This caused great anguish for A-Square.</p><p>(§ 22 How I then tried to diffuse the Theory of Three Dimensions by other means, and of the result)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart">My brother is one of the best of Squares, just, sensible, cheerful, and not without fraternal affection; yet I confess that my weekly interviews, at least in one respect, cause me the bitterest pain.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He was present when the Sphere manifested himself in the Council Chamber; he saw the Sphere’s changing sections; he heard the explanation of the phenomena then give to the Circles. Since that time, scarcely a week has passed during seven whole years, without his hearing from me a repetition of the part I played in that manifestation, together with ample descriptions of all the phenomena in Spaceland, and the arguments for the existence of Solid things derivable from Analogy.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yet—I take shame to be forced to confess it—my brother has not yet grasped the nature of Three Dimensions, and frankly avows his disbelief in the existence of a Sphere.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>With no other activities to engage in within the confines of the prison, A-Square began writing his memoir. <strong>This memoir is what we know as "Flatland," the book we are familiar with.</strong></p><p>(§ 22 How I then tried to diffuse the Theory of Three Dimensions by other means, and of the result)</p><blockquote><p></p><p>Hence I am absolutely destitute of converts, and, for aught that I can see, the millennial Revelation has been made to me for nothing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Prometheus (Προμηθεύς = forethought) </strong>up in Spaceland was bound for bringing down fire for mortals, but I—poor Flatland Prometheus—lie here in prison for bringing down nothing to my countrymen. <strong>Yet I existing the hope that these memoirs, in some manner, I know not how, may find their way to the minds of humanity in Some Dimension, and may stir up a race of rebels who shall refuse to be confined to limited Dimensionality.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>That is the hope of my brighter moments. Alas, it is not always so. Heavily weights on me at times the burdensome reflection that I cannot honestly say I am confident as to the exact shape of the once-seen, oft-regretted Cube; and in my nightly visions the mysterious precept, 「Upward, not Northward,」 haunts me like a soul-devouring Sphinx.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is part of the martyrdom which I endure for the cause of Truth that there are seasons of mental weakness, when Cubes and Spheres flit away into the background of scarce-possible existences; when the Land of Three Dimensions seems almost as visionary as the Land of One or None; nay, when even this hard wall that bars me from my freedom, these very tablets on which I am writing, and all the substantial realities of Flatland itself, appear no better than the offspring of a diseased imagination, or the baseless fabric of a dream.</p><p></p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/63b625d6-68a6-4489-9997-717d38668163.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Thus concludes A-Square's memoir. This is the story that was published as "Flatland" in 1884.</p><p>The traveler snapped out of his reverie and refocused his attention on the elder's narration of the town's past.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/8e135eba-e1f2-4025-80cf-d1d7e7ad41a2.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Traveler's Question</strong></h3><p>Coming back to his senses, the traveler heard the old man say that the girl had grown up. While her mathematical abilities hadn't advanced significantly, her achievements in music and literature had grown increasingly refined. The townspeople adored her singing and piano performances, and the couple, along with their little daughter, experienced a truly blessed time.</p><p>Regrettably, shortly after the young girl reached adulthood, her father fell victim to an illness, evoking sympathy from the townspeople who mourned the family's loss.</p><p>As the old man carried on recounting the family's history, the traveler couldn't resist interrupting and posing a question that had piqued his curiosity.</p><p><strong>Traveler</strong>: Excuse me, I am intrigued to learn how that girl eventually pursued a path in mathematics and became a mathematician.</p><p><strong>Old man</strong>: That girl became a mathematician?</p><p><strong>Traveler</strong>: Indeed, as it is inscribed on her tombstone. I am genuinely curious about her journey of learning mathematics.</p><p><strong>Old man</strong>: I'm afraid I have to disappoint you, that girl did not become a mathematician in the end.</p><p><strong>Traveler</strong>: I'm perplexed. Why would the girl's tombstone bear the inscription "Mathematician Daughter ▲," while her parents' tombstones are marked with "Mathematician's Father ◭" and "Mathematician's Mother ◮"?</p><p><strong>Old man</strong>: That's a misconception, and it relates to the tragedy that befell the family later on.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/80303671-079f-4a78-8b0e-56a47817cb47.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Choice</strong></h3><p>The old man hesitated briefly, seemingly contemplating where to commence his memory.</p><p>The little daughter of that family was optimistic by nature. Besides her love for music and mathematics, she sometimes went to a nearby town to help at an orphanage, where she would teach the children to write, read, and of course, music.</p><p>In a certain year, rumors spread of a colossal war, unprecedented in history, which had broken out. Perplexingly, no one beyond the town could offer a clear explanation for its cause.</p><p>Some attributed it to a fierce conflict over valuable minerals, while others pointed to a contentious issue of noble inheritance. Yet, there were those who believed that the primary catalyst lay in a religious conflict, as only such a profound dispute could mobilize such a vast number of people.</p><p>It was rumored that this war, ignited by factions within the same religion, stemmed from a dispute over the translation of a single word in the scripture. One faction advocated for translating the word as "this," while the opposing faction insisted on translating it as "that." Remarkably, this seemingly innocent word carried a profound connotation of "up."</p><p>Neither side could sway the other, and the contentious debate persisted for countless years, accumulating sporadic vendettas and an array of conflicts. Interests clashed, political calculations intertwined, ultimately culminating in the outbreak of a massive war.</p><p>Countless lives were lost, fields transformed into desolate wastelands, and cities reduced to ruins.</p><p>Fortunately, owing to the town's strategic insignificance, the immediate vicinity remained relatively tranquil and unscathed by the ravages of war, allowing life to continue undisturbed.</p><p>The little daughter of that family, as usual, hummed her favorite song to the orphanage to teach the children music.</p><p>As the old man recounted this, he let out a sigh and uttered, "Disaster! What a disaster!"</p><p>It remains unknown which side's deserters, seeking to exploit the vulnerability of the poorly guarded orphanage, intended to pillage it. Their aim was to steal food, appropriate donations, and even abduct the children to sell them elsewhere. In the face of these thugs, the head of the orphanage bravely confronted them, instructing the girl from that family to lead the children and escape to the nearby town.</p><p>The head of the orphanage engaged in a fierce struggle with the deserters, inflicting injuries, but eventually succumbing and falling in a pool of blood, sacrificing his life for the children's sake.</p><p>The girl ran alongside the children, urging them not to look back, but to keep running until they reached the safety of the town. Even while fleeing, she valiantly fought back the pursuers with stones strewn along the path.</p><p>In her brave defense, she gravely wounded one of the deserters, further enraging the remaining accomplices. Though their anger stemmed not from the impending demise of their comrade, but from the audacity of a seemingly feeble entity daring to resist them. Yet, amidst their fury, they couldn't help but experience a tinge of schadenfreude—relishing the fact that there was now one less person to share their ill-gotten gains.</p><p>The pursuers harbored a delusion, believing that chasing after a young girl was an easier path to survival than going to battle, and that it would yield greater rewards. If stones were thrown, surely their unfortunate accomplice would bear the brunt, skillfully dodging any incoming projectiles.</p><p>To their astonishment, the stones wielded by the girl proved far more perilous than they had imagined. Each stone followed a destined parabolic trajectory, converging precisely on moving heads, claiming the lives of two more pursuers. In their foolishness, the remaining individuals hastily wrapped whatever they could find around their heads in a futile attempt to shield their most rational part. Panicking and with obstructed vision, they stumbled one after another while giving chase, their pace slowed to a crawl, unable to keep up with the agile girl.</p><p>The girl herself sustained injuries, her clothes drenched in blood. When she finally reached the nearby town with the children, her strength waned, her complexion turned ashen, and she collapsed onto the ground, unconscious.</p><p>The townspeople who arrived to offer assistance were relieved to find no sign of the pursuing thugs, as they surely would not dare attack a densely populated town.</p><p>They did their utmost to save her, staunching her bleeding and keeping a vigil by her bedside. However, before the dawn of the new day, the girl departed from this world.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/077475d8-741d-4ba3-9ea3-6d609006d8ac.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Mother's Question</strong></h3><p>The news of the girl's death spread back to the town where she grew up, leaving behind one mother whose face was constantly wet with tears.</p><p>"My daughter! My dear, foolish daughter! My dear, foolish daughter!"</p><p>Those who came to offer solace and support could only hear the echoes of this grieving mother's repeated sobs. She had no other words to express her pain, only tears streaming down her face. The separation from her daughter was tormenting her like a heart-wrenching pain, her soul was screaming silently.</p><p>For several days, the mother remained immersed in profound grief, barely eating, and surviving on little more than a sip of water. Not sleeping much, most of the time sitting by the window, as if she could still see her little daughter playing spinning under the night sky in front of her, hearing her daughter's piano and singing, sorrow catalyzed the whitening of her hair, the people who came could clearly see her accelerated aging, the whole person seemed to have lost the breath of the soul, the successive deaths of her husband and daughter caused her a heavy blow.</p><p>The mother was not just sitting idly, alongside reminiscing about the cherished moments spent with her husband and daughter, she pondered several questions, "The priests spoke of heaven and another world. Are my husband and daughter in heaven? Is my daughter happy there? Can my daughter sing in heaven?"</p><p>On one night, after sitting for half a day, the mother finally couldn't withstand the fatigue and closed her eyes to sleep.</p><p>In her dream, she saw a point of light, which seemed to be infinitely far away, and was separated from her by a vague human figure. She felt a deep awe.</p><p>The mother asked the questions she had been wanting to ask.</p><p><strong>The Mother</strong>: May I ask if my daughter has arrived in heaven? Is she happy there?</p><p><strong>Human Figure</strong>: Your daughter is an excellent mathematician. Her soul (ψυχή) beautiful (καλός), logical (λογος), miraculous (θαύμα), happy (ευδαιμονία).</p><p>Upon hearing the words of the ethereal figure, she was overcome with ecstasy, weeping and laughing in her dream, as if her soul was no longer torn asunder.</p><p><strong>Human figure</strong>: Your soul (ψυχή) beautiful (καλός), logical (λογος), happy (ευδαιμονία). You are also a mathematician.</p><p>The mother no longer comprehended the figure's words in her dream. She only recalled that her daughter was blissful in heaven, and a profound sense of relief washed over her.</p><p>In her understanding, her daughter had reached heaven, and was very happy in heaven. Her dear little daughter even became the mathematician she dreamed of becoming.</p><p>The only peculiarity was that the "angel" had referred to her as a mathematician as well. The mother attributed it to her old age and possible confusion, believing that the "angel" had intended to say she was the mother of her beautiful, logical, and happy mathematician daughter.</p><p>She harbored no doubt about the reality of her dream. Everything felt vivid and tangible. she firmly believed that her beloved daughter resided in a state of blissful existence within the realms of heaven.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/d0b32aa0-4e1f-43f5-ac9f-778b233120b4.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Tombstone Inscriptions</strong></h3><p>Following that fateful night, the mother underwent a profound transformation. Gone were the days of sorrow and tears. The very next morning, she hurried to her daughter's tombstone and engraved the words <strong>"Mathematician Daughter ▲"</strong> beneath her name.</p><p>Concern spread among the townsfolk, wondering if she had succumbed to delirium or madness due to overwhelming grief.</p><p>She took the time to explain to familiar faces in the town everything she had experienced and witnessed in her dream. She declared, "My daughter has reached heaven and become the mathematician she aspired to be. I am at peace."</p><p>Some townspeople chose to believe her, offering heartfelt gratitude to a higher power. "Thank God! Thank God! Thank God!" they exclaimed.</p><p>Others harbored doubts, perceiving the elderly woman's mental state as fragile but kindly refrained from disputing her claims.</p><p>A few remained skeptical, acknowledging that her daughter's ascension to heaven seemed plausible - after all, she was such a virtuous girl - but doubting that her daughter could become a mathematician. They thought it was probably a kind lie from the "angel".</p><p>Still, others thought, "Whether this is true or not, at least this poor woman is no longer washing her face with tears. This is what her husband and daughter would have liked to see."</p><p>Now, only the elderly lady remained in the family within the small town. Her other children implored her to leave and reside with them, assuring her of their care. However, she insisted on staying in the familiar surroundings, finding solace in the support of her neighbors. She longed to accompany her husband and young daughter until the end of her days, believing it would lessen the chances of losing her way to heaven and facilitate a joyful reunion. After all, she was an old lady who struggled to navigate by reading maps.</p><p>Several more years passed, and eventually, the elderly lady, too, passed away.</p><p>In her final moments, those who had been caring for her overheard her whispering, "Am I also a mathematician? Oh, my daughter is the mathematician."</p><p>Upon her demise, the townspeople inscribed the tombstones of both her and her husband: <strong>"Mathematician's Father ◭"</strong> and <strong>"Mathematician's Mother ◮."</strong></p><p>This is the origin of the inscriptions on those three tombstones, providing the answer the stranger sought to uncover.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/dbb643e2-8c16-482a-b440-efd0594a3d1b.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Having attentively absorbed the tale of this family, the traveler conveyed his sincerest gratitude to the elderly narrator, leaving behind a meaningful token of appreciation.</p><p>Prior to departing the small town, the traveler he offered flowers to the family's tombstone.</p><p>His mind drifted to the beginning passage from "<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/201/201-h/201-h.htm">Flatland</a></strong>":</p><blockquote><p>To</p><p>The Inhabitance of SPACE IN GENERAL</p><p>And H.C.

However, the residents of the two-dimensional plane world have very limited possibilities they can perceive; they can only make choices visible within their field of view.</p><p>Although both the "shape-based" and "color-based" philosophies may seem incomplete and destined for disaster, both sides sincerely believe that the philosophy they uphold can solve everything. They fail to realize that both "shape" and "color" are projections of the three-dimensional world onto the two-dimensional plane.</p><p>People in the three-dimensional world know that there is something deeper. The simple pursuit of "shape" or "color" cannot solve the ignorance, problems, and conflicts of the two-dimensional world.</p><p>Three-dimensional observers wonder why two-dimensional people would fight to the death for such incomplete philosophies. In contrast, the residents of the two-dimensional plane world find the speculations of the three-dimensional inhabitants unbelievable, viewing them as either pure fantasies or the whispers of the devil.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/8edb9d62-e1a7-4672-856c-67b015da7642.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>A Square's Visit to the One-Dimensional Linear World</strong></h3><p>On the penultimate day of 1999, A-Square, the protagonist of "Flatland," had a dream.</p><p>In the dream, A Square, being a two-dimensional square, observed a "line space" within an unknown realm. On this "line space," A Square witnessed various line segments.</p><p>(§ 13 How I had a Vision of Lineland)</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f62ac811-c854-4cae-a0c0-3eeb82be0cc2.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In this one-dimensional linear world, the longest line is the king. In this one-dimensional kingdom, length represents the highest value and serves as the foundation of social order.</p><p>Initially, A-Square attempted to have a conversation with the "Line King," but discovered that the "Line King" didn't know where A-Square's voice was coming from. For the king, A-Square's voice originated from an unknown direction (as anything outside the linear space was unknown to the "Line King").</p><p>(§ 13 How I had a Vision of Lineland)</p><blockquote><p>It seemed that this poor ignorant Monarch—as he called himself—was persuaded that the Straight Line which he called his Kingdom, and in which he passed his existence, constituted the whole of the world, and indeed the whole of Space. Not being able either to move or to see, save in his Straight Line, he had no conception of anything out of it. Though he had heard my voice when I first addressed him, the sounds had come to him in a manner so contrary to his experience that he had made no answer, 「seeing no man,」 as he expressed it, 「and hearing a voice as it were from my own intestines.」</p></blockquote><p>From the king's perspective, A-Square's voice seemed to be "emanating from within."</p><p>For a line, the left end and the right end are considered "sides," while everything between the left and right ends is considered <strong>"inside" (εσωτερικός = esoteric = internal)</strong>. And anything that is neither "side" nor "inside" is considered <strong>"outside" (εξωτερικός = exoteric = external)</strong>.</p><p>The king believed that the line space he perceived constituted the entirety of the world.</p><p>(§ 13 How I had a Vision of Lineland)</p><blockquote><p>Until the moment when I placed my mouth in his World, he had neither seen me, nor heard anything except confused sounds beating against, what I called his side, but what he called his <strong>inside</strong> (εσωτερικός = esoteric = internal) or <strong>stomach;</strong> nor had he even now the least conception of the region from which I had come. Outside his World, or Line, all was a blank to him; nay, not even a blank, for a blank implies Space; say, rather, all was non-existent.</p></blockquote><p>In this one-dimensional linear kingdom, auditory perception is the most important distinguishing sense because everyone can only see a single point, similar to how residents of a two-dimensional world perceive only a line.</p><p>(§ 13 How I had a Vision of Lineland)</p><blockquote><p>His subjects—of whom the small Lines were men and the Points Women—were all alike confined in motion and eyesight to that single Straight Line, which was their World. It need scarcely be added that the whole of their horizon was limited to a Point; nor could any one ever see anything but a Point. Man, woman, child, thing—each as a Point to the eye of a Linelander. Only by the sound of the voice could sex or age be distinguished.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/542fee08-a91f-4a2b-ad01-5601edcbe43d.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In A-Square's eyes, the one-dimensional world appeared quite dull, monotonous, and boring. However, he unexpectedly discovered that the king was full of vitality.</p><p>(§ 13 How I had a Vision of Lineland)</p><blockquote><p>Such a life, with all vision limited to a Point, and all motion to a Straight Line, seemed to me inexpressibly dreary; and I was surprised to note that vivacity and cheerfulness of the King. Wondering whether it was possible, amid circumstances so unfavourable to domestic relations, to enjoy the pleasures of conjugal union, I hesitated for some time to question his Royal Highness on so delicate a subject; but at last I plunged into it by abruptly inquiring as to the health of his family. 「My wives and children,」 he replied, 「are well and happy.」</p></blockquote><p>A-Square attempted to explain to the one-dimensional king that in this world, apart from the concepts of north and south, there are also east and west (left and right). However, the one-dimensional king expressed confusion, and their ensuing conversation ended up in communication failure.</p><p>(§ 14 How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart"><strong>King</strong>: 「...though I know not what you mean by ‘right’ and ‘left.’ But I deny that you saw these things. For how could you see the Line, that is to say the inside, of any Man? But you must have heard these things, and then dreamed that you saw them. And let me ask what you mean by those words ‘left’ and ‘right.’ I suppose it is your way of saying Northward and Southward.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>「Not so,」 replied <strong>I</strong>; 「besides your motion of Northward and Southward, there is another motion which I call from right to left.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>King:</strong> Exhibit to me, if you please, this motion from left to right.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I:</strong> Nay, that I cannot do, unless you could step out of your Line altogether.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>King:</strong> Out of my Line? Do you mean out of the world? Out of Space?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I:</strong> Well, yes. Out of <strong>your</strong> world. Out of <strong>your</strong> Space. For your Space is not the true Space. True Space is a Plane; but your Space is only a Line.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>King:</strong> If you cannot indicate this motion from left to right by yourself moving in it, then I beg you to describe it to me in words.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I: </strong>If you cannot tell your right side from your left, I fear that no words of mine can make my meaning clearer to you. But surely you cannot be ignorant of so simple a distinction.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>King</strong>: I do not in the least understand you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Alas! How shall I make it clear? When you move straight on, does it not sometimes occur to you that you <strong>could</strong> move in some other way, turning your eye round so as to look in the direction towards which your side is now fronting? In other words, instead of always moving in the direction of one of your extremities, do you never feel a desire to move in the direction, so to speak, of your side?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>King:</strong> Never. And what do you mean? How can a man’s inside 「front」 in any direction? Or how can a man move in the direction of his inside?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I:</strong> Well then, since words cannot explain the matter, I will try deeds, and will move gradually out of Lineland in the direction which I desire to indicate to you.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/92849a2a-9515-4bbf-a560-1ca399a69250.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When it became apparent that language was completely ineffective and their linguistic systems had non-overlapping realms, A-Square decided to persuade the king through action and tangible "phenomena." A-Square planned to "project" himself into the one-dimensional space, allowing the king to "perceive" his true existence.</p><p>And A-Square succeeded in making the king perceive his "projection."</p><p>(§ 14 How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart">At the word I began to move my body out of Lineland. As long as any part of me remained in his dominion and in his view, the King kept exclaiming, 「I see you, I see you still; you are not moving.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But when I had at last moved myself out of his Line, he cried in his shrillest voice, 「She is vanished; she is dead.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>「I am not dead,」 replied I; 「I am simply out of Lineland, that is to say, out of the Straight Line which you call Space, and in the true Space, where I can see things as they are. And at this moment I can see your Line, or side—or inside as you are pleased to call it; and I can see also the Men and Women on the North and South of you, whom I will now enumerate, describing their order, their size, and the interval between each.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When I had done this at great length, I cried triumphantly, 「Does that at last convince you?」 And, with that, I once more entered Lineland, taking up the same position as before.</p></blockquote><p>A-Square traversing his entire square body along the linear dimension.</p><p>From the king's perception, this action appeared as A-Square "suddenly" appearing and then "suddenly" disappearing, as if he had come and died.</p><p>A-Square believed that by accomplishing this "miracle," he could make the king believe. However, he didn't anticipate the deep-rooted inertia of the king's worldview. The king simply regarded A-Square as a demon or an evil entity.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/be12e43a-9799-4e7a-9df2-ce1698b943d3.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The king's "linear rationality" led him to reach a "clear" conclusion: A-Square did not actually move but rather employed magical tricks of disappearance and reappearance. The king believed that the "new world" proclaimed by A-Square did not exist.</p><p>Upon hearing this, A-Square became angry.</p><p>(§ 14 How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland)</p><blockquote><p>Furious at his perversity, and especially indignant that he professed to be ignorant of my sex, I retorted in no measured terms, 「Besotted Being! You think yourself the perfection of existence, while you are in reality the most imperfect and imbecile. You profess to see, whereas you see nothing but a Point! You plume yourself on inferring the existence of a Straight Line; but I <strong>can see</strong> Straight Lines, and infer the existence of Angles, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and even Circles. Why waste more words? Suffice it that I am the completion of your incomplete self. You are a Line, but I am a Line of Lines called in my country a Square: and even I, infinitely superior though I am to you, am of little account among the great nobles of Flatland, whence I have come to visit you, in the hope of enlightening your ignorance.」</p></blockquote><p>A-Square's arrogance successfully provoked the anger of the one-dimensional king, who attempted to attack A-Square.</p><p>(§ 14 How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland)</p><blockquote><p>Hearing these words the King advanced towards me with a menacing cry as if to pierce me through the diagonal; and in that same movement there arose from myriads of his subjects a multitudinous war-cry, increasing in vehemence till at last methought it rivalled the roar of an army of a hundred thousand Isosceles, and the artillery of a thousand Pentagons. Spell-bound and motionless, I could neither speak nor move to avert the impending destruction; and still the noise grew louder, and the King came closer, when I awoke to find the breakfast-bell recalling me to the realities of Flatland.</p></blockquote><p>And then A-Square's dream ended.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/33ee342c-6974-442a-bcc8-64456d52efd2.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Visitor from the three-dimensional space</strong></h3><p>On the day following A-Square's dream visit to the one-dimensional world, he encountered a visitor from the three-dimensional space.</p><p>(§ 15 Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>It was the last day of our 1999th year of our era. The patterning of the rain had long ago announced nightfall; and I was sitting in the company of my wife, musing on the events of the past and the prospects of the coming year, the coming century, the coming Millennium.</p></blockquote><p>In the house where A-Square resides, a strange sound appeared, along with the appearance of a "person," which greatly frightened A-Square and his wife.</p><p>(§ 15 Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>My Wife as well as myself heard the words, although she did not understand their meaning, and both of us sprang forward in the direction of the sound. What was our horror when we saw before us a Figure! At the first glance it appeared to be a Woman, seen sideways; but a moment’s observation shewed me that the extremities passed into dimness too rapidly to represent one of the Female Sex; and I should have thought it a Circle, only that it seemed to change its size in a manner impossible for a Circle or for any regular Figure of which I had had experience.</p></blockquote><p>After A-Square asked his wife to leave, he recognized the unfamiliar visitor as a "<strong>Circle</strong>," one of the most respected entities in his society.</p><p>(§ 15 Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>then, suddenly recoiling, 「Oh! it is not a Woman, and there are no angles either, not a trace of one. Can it be that I have so misbehaved to a perfect Circle?」</p></blockquote><p>The unfamiliar visitor spoke enigmatic words.</p><p>(§ 15 Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>「I am indeed, in a certain sense a Circle,」 replied the Voice, 「and a more perfect Circle than any in Flatland; but to speak more accurately, I am many Circles in one.」 ...... I glanced at the half-hour glass. The last sands had fallen. The third Millennium had begun.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b662e466-249a-4d4b-b5a0-98a3b995385e.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When this unfamiliar Sphere "descends" into the two-dimensional space where A-Square resides, he perceives it as a Circle based on his experience and knowledge.</p><p>The perception of the Circle by A-Square is the two-dimensional <strong>cross-section</strong> of the "sphere" in the flat plane.</p><p>What A-Square's sensory eyes perceive is the one-dimensional projection of this sphere's two-dimensional cross-section.</p><p>Through a perceptive interpretation of this one-dimensional projection, A-Square concludes that he sees a two-dimensional "Circle."</p><p>(§ 16 How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>There was not the trace of an angle, not the slightest roughness or inequality: never in my life had I met with a more perfect Circle. He remained motionless while I walked around him, beginning from his eye and returning to it again. Circular he was throughout, a perfectly satisfactory Circle; there could not be a doubt of it.</p></blockquote><p></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f3c7dc3e-1500-4f65-b189-8fa12552e346.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/2b74dceb-d4c9-47ec-b438-3f1f161951fc.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Revelation of the Three-Dimensional Visitor</strong></h3><p>A-Square witnessed the appearance of a stranger in his house, and the "roundness" of this unfamiliar individual surpassed any approximations to roundness he had ever encountered. In A-Square's worldview and value system, approaching roundness was synonymous with nobility, leading him to hold deep respect and admiration for the visitor.</p><p>(§ 16 How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>Then followed a dialogue, which I will endeavour to set down as near as I can recollect it, omitting only some of my profuse apologies—for I was covered with shame and humiliation that I, a Square, should have been guilty of the impertinence of feeling a Circle. It was commenced by the Stranger with some impatience at the lengthiness of my introductory process.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. Have you felt me enough by this time? Are you not introduced to me yet?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Most illustrious Sir, excuse my awkwardness, which arises not from ignorance of the usages of polite society, but from a little surprise and nervousness, consequent on this somewhat unexpected visit. And I beseech you to reveal my indiscretion to no one, and especially not to my Wife. But before your Lordship enters into further communications, would he deign to satisfy the curiosity of one who would gladly know whence his visitor came?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. From Space, from Space, Sir: whence else?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Pardon me, my Lord, but is not your Lordship already in Space, your Lordship and his humble servant, even at this moment?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. Pooh! what do you know of Space? Define Space.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Space, my Lord, is height and breadth indefinitely prolonged.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. Exactly: you see you do not even know what Space is. You think it is of Two Dimensions only; but I have come to announce to you a Third—height, breadth, and length.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>A-Square and the Three-Dimensional Spherical Visitor repeated, in a certain form, the interaction process A-Square had with the One-Dimensional King the previous day. The Three-Dimensional Visitor attempted to explain the existence of the "third dimension - height" to A-Square, but he couldn't grasp it entirely.</p><p>What exactly is "height"? &nbsp;A-Square remained completely unable to comprehend.</p><p>(§ 16 How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart"><strong>I</strong>. Your Lordship is pleased to be merry. We also speak of length and height, or breadth and thickness, thus denoting Two Dimensions by four names.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. But I mean not only three names, but Three Dimensions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Would your Lordship indicate or explain to me in what direction is the Third Dimension, unknown to me?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. I came from it. It is up above and down below.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. My Lord means seemingly that it is Northward and Southward.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. I mean nothing of the kind. I mean a direction in which you cannot look, because you have no eye in your side.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Pardon me, my Lord, a moment’s inspection will convince your Lordship that I have a perfectly luminary at the juncture of my two sides.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. Yes: but in order to see into Space you ought to have an eye, not on your Perimeter, but on your side, that is, on what you would probably call your inside; but we in Spaceland should call it your side.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. An eye in my inside! An eye in my stomach! Your Lordship jests.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. I am in no jesting humour. I tell you that I come from Space, or, since you will not understand what Space means, from the Land of Three Dimensions whence I but lately looked down upon your Plane which you call Space forsooth. From that position of advantage I discerned all that you speak of as <strong>solid</strong> (by which you mean 「enclosed on four sides」), your houses, your churches, your very chests and safes, yes even your insides and stomachs, all lying open and exposed to my view.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>The topic of "lateral" and <strong>"inside"</strong><strong>(εσωτερικός = esoteric = internal) </strong>reappeared in a different form during the conversation between A-Square and the Spherical Visitor.</p><p>And so, the two continued their futile communication across dimensions.</p><p>(§ 16 How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p></p><p><strong>Stranger</strong>. No, indeed. By 「height」 I mean a Dimension like your length: only, with you, 「height」 is not so easily perceptible, being extremely small.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. My Lord, your assertion is easily put to the test. You say I have a Third Dimension, which you call 「height.」 Now, Dimension implies direction and measurement. Do but measure my 「height,」 or merely indicate to me the direction in which my 「height」 extends, and I will become your convert. Otherwise, your Lordship’s own understand must hold me excused.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>Just as the "linear rationality" of the one-dimensional king could not understand A-Square's revelation, A-Square's "planar rationality" could not comprehend the revelation of a sphere with a higher dimension than him.</p><p>After a round of ineffective persuasion, the Sphere decided to perform a "miracle". The Sphere moved its body to "penetrate" the plane where A Square was located. In A Square's vision, the Sphere "shrunk" and then "disappeared", yet A Square could still hear the Sphere's voice from "inside his body".</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/90c6d6b8-3722-49e9-babc-14d1738baead.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>(§ 16 How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>But to me, proficient though I was in <strong>Flatland</strong><strong>Mathematics</strong>, it was by no means a simple matter. The rough diagram given above will make it clear to any Spaceland child that the Sphere, ascending in the three positions indicated there, must needs have manifested himself to me, or to any Flatlander, as a Circle, at first of full size, then small, and at last very small indeed, approaching to a Point. But to me, although I saw the facts before me, the causes were as dark as ever. All that I could comprehend was, that the Circle had made himself smaller and vanished, and that he had now re-appeared and was rapidly making himself larger.</p></blockquote><p>After the Sphere demonstrated the "miracle", A-Square was still deeply confused. Therefore, like Socrates, the Sphere performed a round of "geometric knowledge midwifery" on A-Square, starting from a point to deduce a line, from a line to a plane, and then trying to deduce three dimensions from the characteristics of a plane.</p><p>But the Sphere failed. A-Square did not believe in the results of mathematical deduction under rational <strong>Logic(Λογος)</strong>. The deduced result was too bizarre, too crazy, too abnormal, and too unacceptable for A-Square. So A-Square went mad.</p><p>(§ 16 How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland)</p><blockquote><p>「Monster,」 I shrieked, 「be thou juggler, enchanter, dream, or devil, no more will I endure thy mockeries. Either thou or I must perish.」 And saying these words I precipitated myself upon him.</p></blockquote><p>Then A Square launched an attack on the revealer.</p><p>(§ 17 How the Sphere, having in vain tried words, resorted to deeds)</p><blockquote><p>It was in vain. I brought my hardest right angle into violent collision with the Stranger, pressing on him with a force sufficient to have destroyed any ordinary Circle: but I could feel him slowly and unarrestably slipping from my contact; not edging to the right nor to the left, but moving somehow out of the world, and vanishing into nothing.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/6c0b25c0-a0b9-47af-bc60-c74e30b41f54.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>A Messenger from Heaven Brings the Three-Dimensional Gospel of the Millennium, but the Chosen Apostle Goes Mad</strong></h3><p>The Sphere felt a sense of disappointment. The Sphere had expected that A-Square, being a relatively fair person and mathematician, would accept the results of its logical deductions despite the limitations in their worldview, flaws, and prejudices. However, A-Square chose to place belief in the one-dimensional projection that his eyes could perceive.</p><p>In the three-dimensional society, there is a rule that every 1,000 years, a <strong>messenger (άγγελος = angel)</strong> is sent to reveal the truth of the three dimensions to the people of the two-dimensional society.</p><p>However, as the new millennium began, the path of preaching faced a significant setback. The three-dimensional <strong>gospel (ευαγγέλιο = ευ + άγγελος = good news)</strong> could not be effectively transmitted.</p><p>The chosen <strong>apostle (απόστολος = one with a mission)</strong>, despite possessing the ability for mathematical logic deduction, refused to accept the results of rational deduction.</p><p>Upon receiving the revelation, the apostle deemed it a bizarre vision and madly attacked the messenger from "heaven".</p><p>(§ 17 How the Sphere, having in vain tried words, resorted to deeds)</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sphere</strong>. Why will you refuse to listen to reason? I had hoped to find in you—as being a man of sense and an accomplished mathematician—a fit apostle for the Gospel of the Three Dimensions, which I am allowed to preach once only in a thousand years: but now I know not how to convince you.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0a62aa55-f544-423e-b3b5-7f1c504634b5.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Three-Dimensional Perspective is Not Omniscient</strong></h3><p>After a series of futile demonstrations of "miracles," the Sphere became desperate. It decided to forcefully "shake" A-Square out of his familiar two-dimensional plane, allowing his eyes to "witness" the "three-dimensional gospel".</p><p>(§ 17 How the Sphere, having in vain tried words, resorted to deeds)</p><blockquote><p>「Fool! Madman! Irregular!」 I exclaimed; 「never will I release thee; thou shalt pay the penalty of thine impostures.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>「Ha! Is it come to this?」 thundered the Stranger: 「then meet your fate: out of your Plane you go. Once, twice, thrice! ’Tis done!」</p></blockquote><p>Once "shaken" out of the two-dimensional plane, A-Square finally understood the Sphere's Revelation and what the "three-dimensional gospel" meant.</p><p>(§ 18 How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there)</p><blockquote><p>I looked, and, behold, a new world! There stood before me, visibly incorporate, all that I had before inferred, conjectured, dreamed, of perfect Circular beauty. What seemed the centre of the Stranger’s form lay open to my view: yet I could see no heart, lungs, nor arteries, only a beautiful harmonious Something—for which I had no words; but you, my Readers in Spaceland, would call it the surface of the Sphere.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>......</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once more I felt myself rising through space. It was even as the Sphere had said. The further we receded from the object we beheld, the larger became the field of vision. My native city, with the interior of every house and every creature therein, lay open to my view in miniature. We mounted higher, and lo, the secrets of the earth, the depths of the mines and inmost caverns of the hills, were bared before me.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ae33d39b-41de-466a-914c-a7769650a081.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>A-Square thought that witnessing such an incredible spectacle was the manifestation of the "omniscience" and "omnipotence" of "God."</p><p>However, A-Square's thoughts were refuted by the Sphere.</p><p>(§ 18 How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart">Awestruck at the sight of the <strong>mysteries (μυστήρια)</strong> of the earth, thus unveiled before my unworthy eye, I said to my Companion, 「Behold, I am become as a God. For the wise men in our country say that to see all things, or as they express it, <strong>omnividence</strong>, is the attribute of God alone.」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There was something of scorn in the voice of my Teacher as he made answer: 「is it so indeed? Then the very pick-pockets and cut-throats of my country are to be worshipped by your wise men as being Gods: for there is not one of them that does not see as much as you see now. But trust me, your wise men are wrong.」</p><p></p></blockquote><p>In the Sphere's view, the vision of the three-dimensional world is neither omniscient nor omnipotent. The vision of the three-dimensional world simply knows more relative to the two-dimensional vision. People in the three-dimensional world can overlook all the details of the two-dimensional plane at any time, but this does not mean that the three-dimensional world is full of good and righteous people. The residents of the three dimensions are just aware of more possibilities.</p><p>The vision of the three dimensions does not equate to the <strong>Good (ἀγαθός)</strong> vision. The three dimensions simply see more than the two dimensions and are aware of more possibilities.</p><p>Just as the two dimensions easily see what the one dimension cannot see, it does not mean that A- Square in the two dimensions is a god. However, if A-Square wishes, he can pretend to be a "god" in the one-dimensional world. This is the information advantage of two-dimensional logic over one-dimensional rationality.</p><p>(§ 18 How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there)</p><blockquote><p><strong>I</strong>. Then is omnividence the attribute of others besides Gods?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Sphere</strong>. I do not know. But, if a pick-pocket or a cut-throat of our country can see everything that is in your country, surely that is no reason why the pick-pocket or cut-throat should be accepted by you as a God. This omnividence, as you call it—it is not a common word in Spaceland—does it make you more <strong>Just (δικαιοσύνη) </strong>, more merciful, less selfish, more <strong>Loving (caritas)</strong>? Not in the least. Then how does it make you more <strong>Divine (άγιος)</strong>?</p><p></p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/eb45e2d0-997a-4095-93bd-f8c6321fd8da.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Order, State, and the Messenger's Predicament</strong></h3><p>After the Sphere revealed its Revelation to A-Square, it brought A-Square to the political core of the two-dimensional Flatland world.</p><p>This was the beginning of the new millennium, the first day of the year 2000, when national leaders were gathered together in a meeting.</p><p>At the meeting, the ruler of Flatland announced that at the beginning of every millennium, there would be subjects who fell into illusions, claiming to have received revelations from "heaven" and spreading words about the "existence of a three-dimensional world", "a dimension beyond length and width", and "a new world", thereby bewitching the public, poisoning the minds and souls of young people, corrupting the morals of society, and endangering the order of the state.</p><p>Thus, the Circles instructed a strict search for these lost individuals.</p><p>After witnessing this, the Sphere, like its predecessors, "descended" to the political core of Flatland and declared the existence of three-dimensional space to the priests.</p><p>The Chief Circle and other top rulers were not surprised by the sudden appearance of a stranger, as such things had happened in history and there were records of these events.</p><p>(§ 18 How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there)</p><blockquote><p>「My Lords,」 said the President to the Junior Circles of the Council, 「there is not the slightest need for surprise; the secret archives, to which I alone have access, tell me that a similar occurrence happened on the last two millennial commencements. You will, of course, say nothing of these trifles outside the Cabinet.」</p></blockquote><p>The Chief Circle ordered silence and locked up all the lower-ranking individuals present.</p><p>A-Square's brother was also present. He was a square clerk, so he was also locked up.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0bfef0f2-e5b1-40ce-8efc-530a6397419e.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Projection, Analogy, Logic</strong></h3><p>After the Sphere completed its "descent" and "revelation," it continued to impart knowledge to A-Square about three-dimensional space, including the understanding of light rays, shadows, and perspectives.</p><p>Through these teachings, A-Square fell into a kind of intoxicated joy, because he realized that, according to the <strong>logic (λόγος)</strong> of <strong>analogy (αναλογία)</strong>, above the "three-dimensional space", there might exist a "four-dimensional space".</p><p>To A-Square, the Sphere was so learned and capable, a high-dimensional existence, that it must understand his logic and have the ability to show A-Square the grandeur of the four-dimensional space.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this move by A-Square angered the Sphere messenger. The Sphere thought that A Square's logic was nonsense, as it had never seen another dimension beyond the three-dimensional space.</p><p>After some twists and turns, they visited the zero-dimensional world. In the zero-dimensional world, there is only one point, one existence, and no one else outside of that zero-dimensional existence. It thinks it is the world and doesn't know there is a broader existence.</p><p>After visiting the zero dimension, the Sphere admitted to its student that there is indeed the possibility of the existence of four-dimensional space.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/c4328907-4206-4544-a1fa-05da9df29b82.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/4d35c96f-78a2-48d0-a0a0-2d07aaa9bcd5.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The traveler passing through the town remembered that Charles Howard Hinton [19] was the one who named the hypercube as a tesseract, and he wrote a book called The Fourth Dimension [20].</p><p>Dionys Burger wrote a book inspired by "Flatland" called "Sphereland" [21].</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/5d737fed-2e37-46df-a523-7b8b2012b307.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9902bbba-8229-497b-a5bb-f1586137052c.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The Three-Dimensional Gospel of the Two-Dimensional Apostle: Upward, Not Northward!</strong></h3><p>After experiencing numerous inexplicable revelations, A-Square had the confidence to spread the three-dimensional gospel to every corner of the two-dimensional world.</p><p>A-Square condensed the gospel into a single phrase: <strong>"Upward, not Northward!"</strong> The revelation described a new dimension in a direction called <strong>"Up"</strong>, analogous to the two-dimensional world's <strong>"North"</strong>.</p><p>Upon waking up, A-Square overheard the council's proclamation. The council ordered the arrest, imprisonment, or execution of anyone who deceived the people's minds with three-dimensional illusions and claimed to have received revelations from another world.</p><p>This alarmed A-Square, and he decided to start his missionary work with those closest to him. He chose his grandson to be his first disciple of the gospel, as his hexagonal grandson was intelligent and had a keen interest in mathematics.</p><p>As A-Square began explaining the possible existence of the third dimension to his grandson, he heard a directive from the highest level being transmitted.</p><p>(§ 21 How I tried to teach the Theory of Three Dimensions to my Grandson, and with what success)</p><blockquote><p><br class="smart">At this moment we heard once more the herald’s 「O yes! O yes!」 outside in the street proclaiming the Resolution of the Council. Young though he was, my Grandson—who was unusually intelligent for his age, and bred up in perfect reverence for the authority of the Circles—took in the situation with an acuteness for which I was quite unprepared. He remained silent till the last words of the Proclamation had died away, and then, bursting into tears, 「Dear Grandpapa,」 he said, 「that was only my fun, and of course I meant nothing at all by it; and we did not know anything then about the new Law; and I don’t think I said anything about the Third Dimension; and I am sure I did not say one word about ‘Upward, not Northward,’ for that would be such nonsense, you know. How could a thing move Upward, and not Northward? Upward and not Northward! Even if I were a baby, I could not be so absurd as that. How silly it is! Ha! ha! ha!」</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p><p>「Not at all silly,」 said I, losing my temper; 「here for example, I take this Square,」 and, at the word, I grasped a moveable Square, which was lying at hand—「and I move it, you see, not Northward but—yes, I move it Upward—that is to say, Northward but I move it somewhere—not exactly like this, but somehow—」 Here I brought my sentence to an inane conclusion, shaking the Square about in a purposeless manner, much to the amusement of my Grandson, who burst out laughing louder than ever, and declared that I was not teaching him, but joking with him; and so saying he unlocked the door and ran out of the room. Thus ended my first attempt to convert a pupil to the Gospel of Three Dimensions.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>A-Square's first attempt at missionary work failed.</p><h2><strong>(Mythos Lullaby - Kosmos Flatland - Part II End)</strong></h2><p></p><p></p>

All these sensory stimuli are real, yet there is a significant deviation in the unconscious inference process, where the fragmented "projection" is taken as the complete whole "source," which is a component of projective geometry's work.</p><p>And one day, someone flying in a helicopter above us, observing us on the ground operating a piece of paper as if it were a phone, also becomes entangled in the great confusion of "what is this person on the ground doing."</p><p>The <strong>Hope (Ελπίς)</strong> may lie in the illusion being an incomplete projection.</p><p>The movement and rotation of the projected source will always generate subtle clues. If those who are trapped in the illusion close their eyes, not solely focusing their attention on the projection's appearance, but instead search for abnormal traces in their memories and meticulously calculate the extraordinary deviations from inertia, they might discover a glimmer of light at the exit. They could hear the loud roar of the helicopter above, prompting them to look up, where the possibility of the right angle (ορθή γωνία = right angle = correct angle) lies.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0fc9de23-c0d5-489c-9278-964a245ca6c1.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p></p><h3><strong>Tower of Knowledge in Two-Dimensional Projection</strong></h3><p>The wandering thoughts of the traveler shift from being fixated on the topic of perception to contemplating the depiction of the priestly hierarchy in the story of "Flatland."</p><p>In the two-dimensional plane world, polygons that closely resemble circles constitute the highest hierarchy of social order. The protagonist, A-Square, explains this.</p><p>(§ 11 Concerning our Priests),</p><blockquote><p>When I call them <strong>Priests</strong>, let me not be understood as meaning no more than the term denotes with you. With us, our Priests are Administrators of all Business, <strong>Art</strong>, and <strong>Science</strong>; Directors of Trade, Commerce, Generalship, Architecture, Engineering, Education, Statesmanship, Legislature, Morality, Theology; doing nothing themselves, they are the <strong>Causes </strong>of everything worth doing, that is done by others.</p></blockquote><p>These nearly circular priests are the philosophers, theologians, metaphysicians, and core rulers of the entire society. They are the aristocrats possessing the most "knowledge." They legislate and interpret the <strong>natural law (Ius naturale)</strong> based on their perceptions and strive to learn and uphold it.</p><p>Although these priests are referred to as "circles" in society, everyone knows that no "circle" is truly a "circle"; all "circles" are merely approximations of polygons (300 polygons, 400 polygons, 500 polygons, and so on).</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/c0ee1fc5-19c6-4193-a46e-16c95ca6265e.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Doctrine of Two-Dimensional Projection: Attend to your Configuration</strong></h3><p>The priests' comprehension of <strong>metaphysics (μεταφυσική = μετά + φυσική = beyond physics)</strong> and <strong>natural law (ius naturale)</strong> is transformed and popularized into the doctrines, laws, culture, customs, and all the subtle thoughts and actions of the general public.</p><p>The core doctrine of the social order in the two-dimensional world where A-Square resides is that</p><p>(§ 12 Of the Doctrine of our Priests)</p><blockquote><p>As to the doctrine of the Circles it may briefly be summed up in a single maxim, <strong>「Attend to your Configuration.」</strong> Whether political, ecclesiastical, or moral, all their teaching has for its object the improvement of individual and collective <strong>Configuration</strong>—with special reference of course to the Configuration of the Circles, to which all other objects are subordinated.</p></blockquote><p>That is to say, the highest value in A-Square's society is to strive towards resembling a "Circle" in geometric figures. The regular polygons with a greater number of sides bear a closer resemblance to a "circle". Consequently, a polygon with 12 sides is considered more noble than one with 10 sides, and a polygon with 10 sides is deemed more noble than one with 5 sides.</p><p>The foundation of society is constituted by triangles with 3 sides. These triangles are further divided into equilateral triangles, which bear a stronger resemblance to circles, isosceles triangles at the next level, while other types of triangles are viewed as inferior.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/285de933-263b-4d97-aabd-a7a220215ec4.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>"Round-based and Attend to your Configuration"</strong> is the core value and worldview of the society in which A Square resides. It serves as the foundation for the entire political order.</p><p>There was once a famous philosopher in the two-dimensional plane world. His name was Pantocyclus (panto + cyclus = everywhere is round). The metaphysics of this philosopher can be summarized as,</p><p>(§ 12 Of the Doctrine of our Priests)</p><blockquote><p></p><p>All faults or defects, from the slightest misconduct to the most flagitious crime, Pantocyclus attributed to some deviation from perfect Regularity in the bodily figure, caused perhaps (if not congenital) by some collision in a crowd; by neglect to take exercise, or by taking too much of it; or even by a sudden change of temperature, resulting in a shrinkage or expansion in some too susceptible part of the frame. Therefore, concluded that illustrious Philosopher, neither good conduct nor bad conduct is a fit subject, in any sober estimation, for either praise or blame. <strong>For why should you praise, for example, the integrity of a Square who faithfully defends the interests of his client, when you ought in reality rather to admire the exact precision of his right angles? Or again, why blame a lying, thievish Isosceles, when you ought rather to deplore the incurable inequality of his sides?</strong></p><p></p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/a343b102-3cb9-475c-9e4a-7d9ac4c331c1.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>What the entire society prioritizes the most is the notion of "tending to be round". The value system heavily centers around geometric figures, while placing less emphasis on intangible <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete">virtues (ἀρετή)</a></strong> such as <strong>temperance (σωφροσύνη)</strong>, <strong>courage (ἀνδρεία)</strong>, <strong>justice (δικαιοσύνη)</strong>, <strong>wisdom (σοφία)</strong>, and so forth.</p><p>In the society where A-Square resides, the perception of nobility and <strong>beauty (καλός)</strong> revolves solely around the concept of "tending to be round".</p><p>The society operates in accordance with this order, and it has been functioning since the beginning of time, spanning two millennia (the events in "Flatland" revolve around the past 1999 and the approaching new millennium of 2000).</p><p>Certainly, the doctrine of "Round-based and Attend to your Configuration" occasionally faces challenges when it comes to interpreting reality.</p><p>(§ 12 Of the Doctrine of our Priests)</p><blockquote><p>Theoretically, this doctrine is unquestionable; but it has practical drawbacks. In dealing with an Isosceles, if a rascal pleads that he cannot help stealing because of his unevenness, you reply that for that very reason, because he cannot help being a nuisance to his neighbours, you, the Magistrate, cannot help sentencing him to be consumed—and there’s an end of the matter. But in little domestic difficulties, when the penalty of consumption, or death, is out of the question, this theory of Configuration sometimes comes in awkwardly; and I must confess that occasionally when one of my own Hexagonal Grandsons pleads as an excuse for his disobedience that a sudden change of temperature has been too much for his Perimeter, and that I ought to lay the blame not on him but on his Configuration, which can only be strengthened by abundance of the choicest sweetmeats, I neither see my way logically to reject, nor practically to accept, his conclusions.</p></blockquote><p>A-Square also observed that the upper echelons of his society did not strictly adhere to the most rigid doctrines when it came to educating their children.</p><p>(§ 12 Of the Doctrine of our Priests)</p><blockquote><p>For my own part, I find it best to assume that a good sound scolding or castigation has some latent and strengthening influence on my Grandson’s Configuration; though I own that I have no grounds for thinking so. At all events I am not alone in my way of extricating myself from this dilemma; for I find that many of the highest Circles, sitting as Judges in law courts, use praise and blame towards Regular and Irregular Figures; and in their homes I know by experience that, when scolding their children, they speak about 「right」 and 「wrong」 as vehemently and passionately as if they believe that these names represented real existence, and that a human Figure is really capable of choosing between them.</p></blockquote><p>In A-Square's society, 300 years ago, the ruling priests held the belief that women lacked rationality, leading them to prohibit women from receiving education.</p><blockquote><p>One other word of warning suggest itself to me, though I cannot so easily mention a remedy; and this also refers to our relations with Women. About three hundred years ago, it was decreed by the Chief Circle that, since women are deficient in Reason but abundant in Emotion, they ought no longer to be treated as rational, nor receive any mental education. The consequence was that they were no longer taught to read, nor even to master Arithmetic enough to enable them to count the angles of their husband or children; and hence they sensibly declined during each generation in intellectual power. And this system of female non-education or quietism still prevails.</p></blockquote><p>And A-Square is concerned that this would lead to the overall decline of society. In comparison to 300 years ago, the intelligence of the contemporary residents in the two-dimensional world is gradually diminishing. A-Square firmly believes that it is imperative for the higher authorities to once again permit women to receive education.</p><blockquote><p>Already methinks I discern a weakness in the grasp of mathematical truth at the present time as compared with the more robust intellect of our ancestors three hundred years ago. I say nothing of the possible danger if a Woman should ever surreptitiously learn to read and convey to her Sex the result of her perusal of a single popular volume; nor of the possibility that the indiscretion or disobedience of some infant Male might reveal to a Mother the secrets of the logical dialect<strong>. On the simple ground of the enfeebling of the male intellect, I rest this humble appeal to the highest Authorities to reconsider the regulations of Female education.</strong></p></blockquote><p>A-Square's perspective is still constrained by the inertia of his deeply ingrained worldview.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/0098b409-9fff-43ae-9409-3d707079d276.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Powerful Opponents of the Two-Dimensional Configuation Order</strong></h3><p>The order established by the Circle Priest class, with its emphasis on "Attend to your Configuration", has encountered formidable challengers in the history of the two-dimensional world.</p><p>In the past, people have discovered that the recognition of geometric shapes can be differentiated by coloring various edges.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f5b88d8d-ff61-46ec-9a7e-e05291e21274.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>(§ 9 Of the Universal Colour Bill)</p><blockquote><p><strong>Year by year the Soldiers and Artisans began more vehemently to assert—and with increasing truth—that there was no great difference between them and the very highest class of Polygons, now that they were raised to an equality with the latter, and enabled to grapple with all the difficulties and solve all the problems of life, whether Statical or Kinetical, by the simple process of Colour Recognition.</strong> Not content with the natural neglect into which Sight Recognition was falling, they began boldly to demand the legal prohibition of all 「monopolizing and aristocratic Arts」 and the consequent abolition of all endowments for the studies of Sight Recognition, Mathematics, and Feeling. Soon, they began to insist that inasmuch as Colour, which was a second Nature, had destroyed the need of aristocratic distinctions, the Law should follow in the same path, and that henceforth all individuals and all classes should be recognized as absolutely equal and entitled to equal rights.</p></blockquote><p>These revolutionaries are known as "<strong>Chromatistes</strong>."</p><p>The "<strong>Chromatistes</strong>" launched a formidable challenge against the "<strong>Formalist Order</strong>".</p><p>The "<strong>Chromatistes</strong>" put forth a new <strong>metaphysics </strong>and value system - "Color solves everything, and the spectrum signifies fulfillment."</p><p>However, the implementation of the "Chromatistes Values" (Colorist Values) resulted in unexpected side effects.</p><p>Science and Art were deemed redundant, leading to a decline in the overall intellect of society.</p><p>(§ 9 Of the Universal Colour Bill)</p><blockquote><p>The Art of Sight Recognition, being no longer needed, was no longer practised; and the studies of Geometry, Statics, Kinetics, and other kindred subjects, came soon to be considered superfluous, and fell into disrespect and neglect even at our University. The inferior Art of Feeling speedily experienced the same fate at our Elementary Schools. Then the Isosceles classes, asserting that the Specimens were no longer used nor needed, and refusing to pay the customary tribute from the Criminal classes to the service of Education, waxed daily more numerous and more insolent on the strength of their immunity from the old burden which had formerly exercised the twofold wholesome effect of at once taming their brutal nature and thinning their excessive numbers.</p><p></p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/edbbfddd-467f-4f0e-b515-85639277773c.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It has also caused unexpected confusion - confusion between circles and lines.</p><p>(§ 9 Of the Universal Colour Bill)</p><blockquote><p></p><p>Bear in mind the decay of Sight Recognition which threatened society at the time of the Colour revolt; add too the certainty that Woman would speedily learn to shade off their extremities so as to imitate the Circles; it must then be surely obvious to you, my dear Reader, that the Colour Bill placed us under a great danger of confounding a Priest with a young</p><p>Woman.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>The original intention of "<strong>Chromatism</strong>" was to weaken the aristocratic class, but inadvertently made the aristocratic class even stronger (due to the preservation of intellect).</p><blockquote><p></p><p>The second object aimed at by the Bill was the gradual demoralization of the Circles themselves. <strong>In the general intellectual decay they still preserved their pristine clearness and strength of understanding. From their earliest childhood, familiarized in their Circular households with the total absence of Colour, the Nobles alone preserved the Sacred Art of Sight Recognition, with all the advantages that result from that admirable training of the intellect.</strong> Hence, up to the date of the introduction of the Universal Colour Bill, the Circles had not only held their own, but even increased their lead of the other classes by abstinence from the popular fashion.</p><p></p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/3e886800-be79-486c-b2a5-36f8353daabd.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Under the belief that "color can solve everything," people also discovered the use of color for deception because, in the new system, people solely relied on color.</p><p>(§ 9 Of the Universal Colour Bill)</p><blockquote><p>It happened that an Isosceles of a low type, with a brain little if at all above four degrees—accidentally dabbling in the colours of some Tradesman whose shop he had plundered—painted himself, or caused himself to be painted (for the story varies) with the twelve colours of a Dodecagon. Going into the Market Place he accosted in a feigned voice a maiden, the orphan daughter of a noble Polygon, whose affection in former days he had sought in vain; and by a series of deceptions—aided, on the one side, by a string of lucky accidents too long to relate, and, on the other, by an almost inconceivable fatuity and neglect of ordinary precautions on the part of the relations of the bride—he succeeded in consummating the marriage. The unhappy girl committed suicide on discovering the fraud to which she had been subjected.</p></blockquote><p>The struggle between "chromatism (coluorism)" and "formalism" ended in a bloody coup and civil war, with the intellectually dominant old priesthood using means to eliminate the "Chromatistes."</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/821f5451-3a4f-4086-bcb9-aa96a439db3f.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>After that, colors were prohibited nationwide.</p><p>A-Square heard that colours would only appear in some of the most advanced and profound courses.</p><p>(§ 10 Of the Suppression of the Chromatic Sedition)</p><blockquote><p>Needless to say that henceforth the use of Colour was abolished, and its possession prohibited. Even the utterance of any word denoting Colour, except by the Circles or by qualified scientific teachers, was punished by a severe penalty. Only at our University in some of the very highest and most esoteric classes—which I myself have never been privileged to attend—it is understood that the sparing use of Colour is still sanctioned for the purpose of illustrating some of the deeper problems of mathematics. But of this I can only speak from hearsay.</p></blockquote><p>The secret of colours was passed down in a cruel manner at the highest level.</p><blockquote><p>Elsewhere in Flatland, Colour is now non-existent. The art of making it is known to only one living person, the Chief Circle for the time being; and by him it is handed down on his death-bed to none but his Successor. One manufactory alone produces it; and, lest the secret should be betrayed, the Workmen are annually consumed, and fresh ones introduced. So great is the terror with which even now our Aristocracy looks back to the far-distant days of the agitation for the Universal Colour Bill.</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/63bb02d0-7183-42df-be53-4ec948e7f15a.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>(Mythos Lullaby - Kosmos Flatland - Part I End)</strong></h2><p></p><p></p>

                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>作者：房間裏的人（社科研究者）</strong></p></blockquote><p>説起葡萄牙，你會想到什麼？可能很多中國人首先想到是出身於馬德拉島的足球明星 C 朗拿度。但近年這個國家以另外一種方式被知曉─移民。</p><p>2008 年發生的金融危機令很多歐洲國家陷入經濟困境，其中境況最差的葡萄牙、愛爾蘭、希臘、西班牙、意大利被戲稱為「歐豬五國」，政府缺錢自然需要想辦法搞錢，黃金簽證於是應運而生。它容許申請人通過投資等值 50 萬歐元的不動產或基金的方式獲得永久居留權，並在 5 年後容許申請入籍。</p><p>拋開婚姻形式不談，移民基本上就是技術和投資兩種形式。葡萄牙並沒有太多技術性工作機會，而對於有投資能力的中國家庭，他們一般會更偏好經濟更發達的英美或沒有語言問題的新加坡。</p><p>然而隨著中國和英美國際關係的變化和獲得當地居留權變得越來越困難，投資成本較低同時條件寬鬆的黃金簽證逐漸成為了移民市場上的寵兒。</p><p>事實上，中國的投資者是黃金簽證最大的申請來源地，下面這張根據葡萄牙統計局製作的圖片顯示從 2012 年開始，截止 2023 年 9 月為止 12,178 通過投資獲得黃金簽證的申請者中有 5,407 位來自中國，佔 44%。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ac0a63bc-d74c-4e26-a4e3-c33b5fbfb826.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>而以下的另一張圖片提供的統計數據則顯示自 2010 後，中國移民的數量開始快速增加。這個快速增加的移民羣體也引起葡國牙學者的興趣，希望搞明白這些移民是誰，又抱著怎樣的心態來到葡萄牙。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/27ea9fa4-5b57-4479-ac34-757d40565c38.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>Source: Amante &amp; Rodrigues (2021).

            </title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>本週我們搞搞新意思，來個粵語教室，聊聊諺語「葾豬頭都有㒼鼻菩薩」。</p><p>「葾」，臭味，葾肨爛臭，傳出難聞的異味，一般源於腐爛的食物。不同於普通話「我手寫我口」，粵語有很多口語，多數人都不認識本字，真要寫出來的話只能取同音但意思不相關的字，即所謂借字，「葾」是其一，通常會寫成大家都認識的「冤」，也有人説正字應該是「蔫」，粵音「煙」。</p><p>「㒼」，通常會寫成借字「萌」，也有人認為正字應為「盲」、「齆」，眾説紛紜。「㒼」意思是閉塞不通，「㒼鼻」即呼吸不順，我特別有資格談論，因為一般人偶爾鼻塞，我卻是偶爾呼吸暢順，大部分時間都或多或少鼻塞。</p><p>廣東人拜神喜歡用豬頭，南方天氣炎熱，古時又沒有冰箱，食物變壞發臭不足為奇，不過不打緊，菩薩是用木雕、石雕或泥塑的，總之都沒有鼻孔，「葾豬頭都有㒼鼻菩薩」，是指即使多數人厭惡的東西，總會找到欣賞的人，通常用於男女關係。</p><p>讀到這裡，相信你也能體會，粵語不但源遠流長，更帶豐富幽默感，很多諺語都十分「抵死啜核」，讓人忍俊不禁。好了，今期我們就聊到這裡… 開玩笑，以下開始正題。</p><h2>迎合大眾口味還是尋找知音小眾</h2><p>假如你是個認真的創作者，但作品沒有人欣賞，你會：</p><ul><li><p>A：改變風格、路線或者創作媒介，以求迎合大眾品味？</p></li><li><p>B：透過積累和整理作品、跟受眾互動、推廣、銷售，更加努力地尋找知音？</p></li></ul><p>你作的曲不夠琅琅上口，就寫出更適合 K 歌的旋律；你拍的影片太過正經，就改成輕鬆搞笑的；你想用文字來表達但新一代把超過一百字的狀態更新都標註 #長文慎入，就改用 TikTok 來製作內容吧。在商言商，怎麼看 A 都像是正確答案。</p><p>我不會説 A 絕對錯，只不過，如果所有作曲家都寫 K 歌，所有 YouTuber 都走詼諧路線，所有人都用 TikTok 表達，那麼非主流的人羣誰來滿足？既然説在商言商，我們且撇開理念，小眾需求沒人滿足關我屁事。但是，小眾需求沒有人滿足，在商言商，不正好是個商機麼？反過來，所有人都跑去滿足最大眾化的需求，那豈不是很擁擠、競爭很激烈的市場？</p><p>你或許會説，我的作品太小眾了，不走更大路的風格，會沒有足夠的人埋單。那當然有可能。不過，下這個結論之前，讓我們先算算指頭，看看曲有多高，和才會太寡。</p><p>假設你讓粉絲以 50 港元或 200 台幣月費訂閲或支持你的作品，目標是 1000 位付費粉絲，即每月收入 5 萬港元或 20 萬台幣，扣除假設佔 20% 的信用卡、平台手續費、支援人員等成本，每月 4 萬港元或 16 萬台幣，還是一份説得過去的收入，尤其是考慮到你做的是自己喜歡、相信的事。</p><p>那麼，尋找 1000 位願意付費支持你的粉絲是甚麼概念？如果以香港人口為基數，就是每約 7000 人中找到一位知音人；以台灣人口為基數，則是每約 23,000 人中找到一位；以世界為基數，就是每 7,000,000 萬人裡面找到一位。</p><p>如果以上的算術沒錯，當你説自己的作品過於曲高和寡，沒有足夠的支持者，你基本上是説，在 7,000,000 人裡頭，即整整一個香港的人口，都沒有一位願意為你的作品埋單。真的是這樣麼？還是我們不夠努力去找？</p><p>葾豬頭尚且有㒼鼻菩薩，何況是用心的創作？除非你的風格、議題、創作媒介都只是試水，還沒定型，隨時可以改變，否則如果你認真創作，真心相信自己的作品，與其嘗試隨波逐流，還不如更努力在人海中找出知音人，一步一步向 1000 位粉絲邁進。</p><h2>1000 true fans</h2><p>為免盜取前輩的光環，我必須強調，這些洞見不是我原創的，而是來自人稱 KK 的 Kevin Kelly。KK 早於 2008 年就寫下短文 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1000 True Fans</a>，啟發了千千萬萬的讀者，當中不少後來成為非常成功的創作者或創業者。</p><p>1000 true fans 顯然不是自古以來就適用的路徑，畢竟在互聯網誕生之前，要單人匹馬把產品賣出方圓十公里外都很難，遑論在全球範圍尋找知音人。1000 true fans 要成立，跟互聯網的發展密不可分。</p><p>1993 年，WIRED 雜誌創刊，定位「The Rolling Stone of Technology」，一直走在資訊科技與互聯網文化的前沿。作為首任主編，也是 The Whole Earth Catalog 的編輯（對，就是封底印有「Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.」那份雜誌），KK 對科技趨勢，尤其是其對社會、經濟的影響，有深刻的洞察力，出版了著名的三部曲<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.books.com.tw/products/E050031774">《失控》</a>、<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010874341">《科技想要甚麼》</a>和<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010753764">《必然》</a>。</p><p>2008 年，互聯網經歷了十多年的發展，即使 iPhone 還沒面世，KK 已經觀察到一個新的典範，寫下 1000 true fans，並由另一位著名作家與投資者 Tim Ferriss 到處推介，發揚光大。到了 2016 年，原文部份細節已經過時，隨著 Tim Ferriss 收錄 1000 true fans 一文的 <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788">Tools of Titan</a></strong> 出版，KK 重寫了更簡潔的新版本。</p><figure class="embed embed-video" data-provider="youtube"><div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/py43k-mSG7s?rel=0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>雖然兩文相隔八年，而後者又距離當下接近八年，但 1000 true fans 的根本論述與倡議始終沒變：作為創作者或創業者，如果目標不是發大財而是維持生計，你不需要目標百萬、千萬、上億的客戶，只需要尋找 1000 位忠實粉絲，持續做好自己，製作優秀的內容和產品；互聯網不但讓作者跟受眾直接互動，又能輕鬆收費，是尋找並維繫知音人的最佳媒介。</p><p>但我必須加上一個重要的註腳。即使目標不只是維生而是揚名立萬，1000 true fans 亦是起步階段的不二法門；成功找出並滿足 1000 位忠粉，再來考慮橫向或縱向發展，比起一開始就嫌市場太小不夠做，靠譜得多。Y Combinator 的聯合創辦人 Paul Graham 提出過很多務實的創業建議，其中一個最重要的正是「<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/brian-chesky-ges-entrepreneurship.html">it’s better to have 100 people love you than a million people that sort of like you</a>」。</p><h2>我的 135 位㒼鼻菩薩</h2><p>我 kin ko 雖然也是 KK，但除了粵語恐怕沒一樣比得上 Kevin Kelly，唯有拾他牙慧，以「葾豬頭都有㒼鼻菩薩」為 1000 true fans 補充這個時空的脈絡，分享我實踐過程中的體會。</p><p>有人覺得，我明知文字已經不流行還只寫文章和出書，流連的社區與支持的產品都跟文字、文章、書本密不可分，不肯轉型 YouTuber、Podcaster，或者做出更順應時代的產品，説得好聽是堅持 L，説得不好聽只是個老頑固。</p><p>固執的確有一點，堅持或許也説得上，但那都不是重點。最核心的原因其實是，潮流總是在變化，即使學會迎合，也很易計畫趕不及變化，與其刻舟求劍，不如保持一貫風格，擇善固執，把迎合的心力都省下來持續創作、推廣以及從各種角度重申觀點，尋找懂得欣賞自己的 1000 true fans。</p><p>這跟不肯聆聽意見的「死牛一面頸」，差之毫釐。聆聽固然是好，但聽誰的，甚麼時候聽，都是關鍵。如果我説你創作的古典音樂有點老土，你該做是無視我而專注尋找知音，就算莫札特再世，我都會覺得他的曲子老土，我根本不是你的受眾。即使是潛在受眾羣中，Alice 跟你説太左，Bob 跟你説太右，Carol 跟你説太大，聽從所有意見是邏輯上的不可能，死路一條；在鎖定個人特色前就隨別人意見改來改去不是聆聽，而是還沒找到自身特色。聆聽是與粉絲互動的過程，跟《喜劇之王》提到「由外入內再到外」的方法演技差不多，首先要創作者向外展現個人特色，找到初步的知音後，所獲的反饋才是最寶貴的意見，需要細心琢磨，考慮融入到個人風格，再一次對外呈現。</p><p>我可並不是説，鎖定個人風格去尋找知音人會比走大眾化路線來得簡單，我體會到的剛好相反，要找到 1000 位願意為自己作品埋單的人絕不輕鬆，需要頑強的意志，不撓的毅力和堅定的信念。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/bb0eaf49-a9ca-4009-9ec0-a8bce46102ac.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>liker.land/ckxpress</figcaption></figure><p>我從去年中起把每篇文章和相關舊文都出版成 Writing NFT 供讀者收集，直到上週，NFT 持有人數量才剛剛到達 1000，執筆之際，共 1002 人。本來，去年出版的《所謂「我不投資」，就是 all in 在法定貨幣》就有 943 位讀者購買，不過好些讀者都太大方，拿到文本甚至單是支持就滿足，總是不來領取應得的 NFT，我只好替這些讀者暫時保管，搞不好要帶著這份責任入土。</p><p>不過，NFT 持有人只是單次客戶，去年賣出一千本書的確是足夠我生活一個月，問題是我可不能每月出版一本書，一年能出版一本都很不錯了。參考 KK 的説法，true fans 的定義是總會購買你新作的粉絲，銅臭卻真實，因為那才稱得上是固定收入，有了這個 fan base，創作者才能心無旁騖，維持品質，持續輸出。</p><p>從這個角度，《區塊鏈社會學》週報的付費訂戶才稱得上忠粉，而我只有寥寥 135 位「true fans」（衷心多謝大家🙏🏼），達標進度僅 13.5%。122 期週報積累 135 位忠粉，平均每週每篇文章 1.1 位，如果維持這個節奏，即使所有人都不退訂，我都還得再寫 15 年多，才能積累到 1000 true fans。</p><hr><blockquote><p>我非常，非常需要大家支持。<br class="smart">如果我的文章給到你啟發或樂趣，或者你認為我的文章有價值，請付費訂閲。<br class="smart">請不要以為我有沒有收入都一樣，也不要誤會我沒所謂。我很需要靠寫作帶來收入，我超有所謂。<br class="smart">如果你能負擔，請不要再猶豫，付費支持。</p><p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://weekly.dhk.org/subscribe?utm_source=ckxpress">👉 好，我考慮一下 👈</a></strong></p></blockquote><hr><p>進度不佳除了因為我堅持開放所有科普文章，較難説服讀者付費，也因為幾年前 LikeCoin 撤銷香港註冊，讓我動態清零一次過失去百多位訂戶。不過，以上或多或少都只是藉口，最重要的還是我不夠努力推廣，內向又社恐，寫作雖然用力，但一到推廣就放軟手腳，佛系又隨緣。</p><p>就算我克服個性，改善推廣，尋找千位忠粉無論如何都是件苦差，更不要説，就算有天真的獲得 1000 true fans，假如到時我的身心已經沒法維持品質或產量，就算讀者願意單為老本付費，我也不好意思繼續收費，寧願停刊。説起這個，台港科技圈最受推崇的電子報，非已經停刊的《<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://daodu.tech/">科技島讀</a>》莫屬，我也是《科》的忠粉，讀過所有文章，聽過所有 podcast，獲益良多，但要説最最欣賞的一點，反而不是分析多有洞見，而是當周欽華先生感到沒法一直維持高質輸出，就毅然決定在高峯期停刊及按比例退款，毫不拖拉。</p><p>創作本來就是辛苦活，創作以外還要推廣、營運、銷售，更是百上加斤；1000 true fans 不是快速致富祕笈，絲毫沒有提供讓創作和推廣變得輕鬆的祕技，再説，想要輕鬆的人生，根本不應以創作或創業維生。1000 true fans 理論純粹告訴我們，如果你真正熱愛創作並相信作品對世界的價值，就不必擔心曲高和寡，只需要盡情創作，同時以最大努力尋找你的㒼鼻菩薩，不，1000 true fans。</p><hr><p>為了科普教育，我的文章全部開放閲讀。即使未能付費訂閲，也可以<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://liker.land/zh-Hant/nft/class/likenft1jdaenjrdyxhtwmcgpxj5kj3zvv2pww2slnz0n74yj657507j0ugqmvnh98?utm_source=widget">單次購入這篇文章</a>，作為紀念與支持。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b6d622a7-cf29-4586-b87a-4a146cb80187.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/55fff657-a79a-4791-9359-53201997e56b.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>《百年之孤寂第二年﹕往事與流言》(照片來源﹕https://shorturl.at/bnuU2)</figcaption></figure><p>文﹕小西</p><p>1982 年，成立不久的進念．二十面體接受台北新象藝術中心的邀請，隨即把《龍舞》和《中國旅程之五﹕香港台北》等兩個作品帶到台灣，參與第一屆亞洲戲劇節。1984 年，他們則帶了《百年之孤寂第二年﹕往事與流言》以及《列女傳 (國語版)﹕三個女人的一隻神話》到台北國立藝術館演出，主辦單位是雲門舞集。進念在 1980 年代初兩次訪台，無論從當時台灣媒體的廣泛報導與評論，還是從台灣劇場中人的親身見証，都在在為台灣劇場 (尤其是小劇場) 帶來了一片衝擊與影響。[1] 本文將嘗試把大家帶回上一個世紀八、九十年代的時空，看看到底是怎樣的政治、經濟、社會與文化條件，促成了進念對當時台灣小劇場的強烈衝擊與深遠的影響，以及在那個瞬息萬變的年代，進念與台灣小劇場界之間頻繁的文化交流情況。</p><p><strong>解嚴前的美學衝擊</strong></p><p>根據進念．二十面體的藝術總監榮念曾的憶述，其實早在 1970 年代中期到末期，已在紐約跟「蘭陵劇坊」的創辦人吳靜吉以及「雲門舞集」的創辦人林懷民認識。[2] 當時他們已經是台灣劇場界的重要人物，而「蘭陵劇坊」更是台灣第一波小劇場運動的重要劇團之一。他認為當時內地與台灣都有着強烈的文以載道的傳統，跟進唸的風格相當不同。</p><p>榮念曾記得，1982 年，由於新象藝術中心要舉辦第一屆亞洲戲劇節，想找香港的表演藝術團體，去了詢問前香港藝穗會總監謝俊興的意見。謝俊興告訴他們，進念．二十面體剛剛成立，於是新象藝術中心便接受了他的意見，向進念發出了正式的邀請。不過，由於當時榮念曾正在協助王穎拍攝電影《點心》，相當忙碌，只交出了《中國旅程之五﹕香港台北》的劇本，並沒有跟隨林奕華、黃慶鏘、歐雪兒等進念年輕成員赴台演出與交流。[3]</p><p>是次進念赴台參與第一屆亞洲戲劇節的，包括《龍舞》與《中國旅程之五》。《龍舞》是一個兒童劇，由王守謙編寫；《中國旅程之五》則以榮念曾之前創作的《中國旅程》二至四為基礎編寫而成。《中國旅程之五》基本上説的是劫機，討論何謂安全，而其中一個重要議題是當時轟動台灣海內外的「陳文成事件」。1981 年 5 月 20 日，美國卡尼基美隆大學統計系助理教授陳文成全家自美返台探親，7 月 2 日被三名警備總部人員帶走約談後，隔日清晨被人發現陳屍於台大研究生圖書館旁。當時國民黨政府曾聲稱陳文成為畏罪自殺，但陳文成的家人與朋友則認為他遭政府謀殺。「陳文成事件」至今真相未明，卻引起了台灣與國際社會的關注，曾經是台灣境內的高度敏感話題。可以想像，在前解嚴的國民黨黨國時代，要在作品中透過「陳文成事件」討論何謂安全、安全與暴力之間的關係等敏感議題，當時大概只有像進念這樣對政治高度敏感的外來前衞藝術團體才有膽量在舞台上直接提出，其可能產生的轟動性，也就可想而知。但榮念曾認為，對於台灣的觀眾來説，《中國旅程之五》所帶來的，首先還是美學上的衝擊﹕</p><blockquote><p>這是一個結構性很強的作品，因為我設定了一個 chart，裡面的內容全都是大家可以自行填補的。他們做了這個作品，也是台灣第一次看見非敍事體的作品，對他們來説是有一定的衝擊的。他們看到一些意象和片段是需要你自己拼湊變成你自己的故事。這是 1982 年，我認為對台灣戲劇界有一個比較重要的衝擊。因為他們和香港是同文同種，大家都是講中文的，對他們來説比較親切，而不是他們去看韓國人講述卡夫卡等等。</p><p>據我得到消息，他們所有表演的場次都是滿座的，甚至最後面是站滿了人的。其中一個就是陳國富，他現在是一個很重要的電影製作人，他也導演了好幾套重要的電影。也包括你剛剛提到的鴻鴻。他們都很好奇，香港究竟會帶來什麼實驗性的作品。以前他們習慣了看敍事體的作品，那是他們第一次看到一個作品，需要他們參與其中的、需要投放一個想法，對他們來説是很新鮮的。[4]</p></blockquote><figure

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>《百年之孤寂第二年﹕往事與流言》排練照，中間者為榮念曾 (照片來源﹕https://shorturl.at/rtCJ4)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>台灣渴望前衞</strong></p><p>但為甚麼像《中國旅程之五》那樣的進唸的招牌非敍事劇場風格，會在 1980 年代初對台灣的劇場界甚至文化界造成這樣大的衝擊? 按鍾明德的分期，1980-1990 年代的台灣小劇場運動可分為兩個階段﹕(一) 「實驗劇時期」﹕1978 年，心理學博士吳靜吉在耕莘實驗劇團 (後來蘭陵劇坊的前身) 所主持的演員訓練，將當時外外百老匯所風行的肢體、聲音訓練和集體即興創作方法傳授給金士傑、卓明、黃承晃、劉靜敏等第一代台灣小劇場創作人，促使了蘭陵劇坊於 1980 年的成立。之後，經過五屆「實驗劇展」的助長，到 1983 年賴聲川回台，創立表演工作坊，在 1985 年以《那一夜，我們説相聲》集其大成，實驗劇由發芽到開花結果，可算是台灣小劇場運動的第一階段。(二)「前衞劇時期」﹕第二代小劇場在 1986 年嶄露頭角，其中有些劇團 (例如屏風表演班、果陀劇場等) 繼承了「實驗劇」的演出方法與風格，有些則在「實驗劇」的基礎上再進一步發展，加上受當時美國、日本、香港前衞劇場的影響，拓展出跟第一代小劇場在政治與美學上廻異的「前衞劇」，例如環墟、河左岸、當代台北、零場、優劇場等等。<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

年代的台灣小劇場運動的內在發展邏輯，基本上是「戲劇地再現台灣此時此刻的慾望」。[6] 在台灣小劇場出現之前，台灣現代戲劇一直以「話劇」為主導，一種沿襲自從二十世紀一、二十年代發展出來的中國/台灣現代戲劇形式。但由於 1980 年代以前，台灣的「話劇」大多堅守當時國民黨政府的反共抗俄意識形態、篤行「推廣標準國語」，「話劇」一直難以在台灣本土生根發展。就此而論，「實驗劇」的興起，可算是在原有話劇機制外另起爐竈的企圖。雖然「實驗劇」基本上仍然説「國語」，也無力質疑國民黨的黨國意識形態，但在題材上已更貼合當代台北的生活與言行舉止，在表演形式上則加入兒童劇場、傳統戲曲等「新」的實驗元素。<a target="_blank"

若果説「實驗劇」跟「話劇」尚有一些折衷和合的地方，1986 年後崛起的「前衞劇」則在美學與政治上更徹底地反體制與顛覆，跟「話劇」劃清界線，且更嚴肅地挖掘與看待台灣被壓抑的語言和歷史。[8]</p><p>換言之，進念兩次訪台 (1982 與 1984 年) 正好處於台灣小劇場運動的第一和第二階段之間。這也解釋了為甚麼進唸的非敍事劇場風格，會在 1980 年代初對台灣的劇場界甚至文化界造成這麼大的衝擊。雖然，早在 1965 年《劇場》雜誌同人已在耕莘文教院的大禮堂翻譯並上演貝克特的名劇《等待果陀》，<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://matters.news/@VXNlcjoxMTAx/%E5%BD%A2%E5%BC%8F%E7%9A%84%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB-%E9%80%B2%E5%BF%B5-%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E9%9D%A2%E9%AB%94%E8%88%87%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%B0%8F%E5%8A%87%E5%A0%B4%E6%97%A9%E6%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81%E5%8F%B2-bafybeihg5m7632b26tbw6vz3qyghwomqxnzqipmft4yoznsh5ipod3j4cm#_ftn9">[9]</a> 但始終 1960 與 1980 年代的政治、社會與文化時空廻異，像《等待果陀》那樣的非敍事劇場作品 (雖然仍然有很重的語言成份)，並沒有像 1980 年代初的進念那樣在 1960 年代中激起同樣的美學與政治上的衝擊。1980 年代初與中期是當代台灣「舊的正在死去，新的還沒有到來」的過渡時期，社會上充滿了蠢蠢欲動、四處流竄的躁動能量，而進唸的非敍事劇場風格正好為第二代台灣小劇場的年輕人打開了一個美學與政治上的缺口。</p><p><strong>國際社會上的亞細亞孤兒</strong></p><p>此外，進念 1980 年代初兩次訪台之所以會對台灣的劇場界造成這樣大的衝擊，也跟當時台灣在國際社會上的位置有關。雖然隨着台灣六、七十年代的「經濟奇蹟」，台灣的整體國民經濟與生活水平，都慢慢得到改善，但也隨着七十年代「退出聯合國」(1971 年)、「中日斷交」(1972 年)、「中美斷交」(1978 年)，無論在政治與文化上，台灣在國際社會上都日趨孤立。雖然，台灣劇場界與文化界一直都有透過翻譯與報導接觸歐美前沿文化，但卻鮮有機會臨場觀賞。可以想像，當進念在 1980 年代初，把當時的台灣人年輕僅能透過書本或雜誌認識的歐美前衞劇場擺在他們的眼前，會有多大的震撼。當時還很年輕的台灣著名劇場導演與劇評人鴻鴻，便這樣描述那份震撼的經驗﹕</p><blockquote><p>因為那個時候關於 Robert Wilson，我們只能看到一些文字資料跟劇照。沒有人看過現場表演，甚至是錄影，那時根本沒有這些東西流動。我們看了進念·二十面體的《百年孤寂》，就好像看到 Robert Wilson 在我們面前演出一樣。<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://matters.news/@VXNlcjoxMTAx/%E5%BD%A2%E5%BC%8F%E7%9A%84%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB-%E9%80%B2%E5%BF%B5-%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E9%9D%A2%E9%AB%94%E8%88%87%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%B0%8F%E5%8A%87%E5%A0%B4%E6%97%A9%E6%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81%E5%8F%B2-bafybeihg5m7632b26tbw6vz3qyghwomqxnzqipmft4yoznsh5ipod3j4cm#_ftn10">[10]</a></p></blockquote><p>況且，説起國際，當時台灣的連結大概跟歐陸的比較少，根據鴻鴻的觀察，要做國際交流的話，可能一個路線是美國，另一個就是香港，「因為香港當時對於台灣人來説，是一個更國際化、更多關係網絡的地方。所以感覺在美學、創作上都有一些比較新的探索是台灣沒有的。」[11]</p><p>除了美學上，1980 年代初進念訪台時也在政治上對台灣造成了不少的衝擊。根據榮念曾的憶述，除了《百年孤寂》之外，進念第二次訪台也帶了《列女傳》去演出與交流。《列女傳》是有關性別議題與女性主義的﹕</p><blockquote><p>對台北的觀眾來説是很震撼的，我們可以這麼直接地討論這些主題。當然，我們也是用非敍事體在講述，我們並不是真的在講故事，但實際上又是在講故事。我轉變了性別和身份的議題，我們在講耶穌其實是女人，有十二個女人在跟著她去搞革命。這是比較早期的社會主義。然後《金瓶梅》也是轉換了性別，變成了一個女人養了六個男妾氏。這些於中國傳統、宗教而言是一個實驗。[12]</p></blockquote><p>我們知道，隨着 1987 解嚴，台灣社會要待至 1980 年代末、1990 年代初才出現第一波波瀾壯闊的女性主義運動，更莫説 1990 年代才崛起的酷兒運動。由此可見，基於歷史的偶然，進念也在 1980 年代初，在誤打誤撞的情況下為台灣的公民社會送上第一輪的性別衝擊波。</p><figure class="image"><img

與經驗上都跟當時台灣小劇場的年輕一代有着一定距離。這或許也解釋了為甚麼跟九十年代的沙磚上不同，榮念曾在 1980 年代台灣的出現，更多被視為啟蒙「劇場導師」甚至生命導師，而非同樣青春叛逆的「同代人」。</p><p>根據榮念曾的憶述，他有隨進念第二次訪台演出。除了演出《百年孤寂》與《列女傳》之外，他還主持了幾個工作坊，開放給當時對表演藝術與實驗藝術感興趣的台北年輕人。無論在演出與工作坊之後，他都跟這一些台北年輕人有很多深入的討論，「他們對我們寫劇本的方法，以及所謂的劇本、文本的結構、處理方法都很有興趣的」。<a

然後這些年輕人組成了幾個團體，例如黃承晃的「筆記劇場」。[14] 這些台灣小劇場年輕團體一直有跟榮念曾聯絡，會來香港跟榮念曾持續討論創作的問題，榮念曾也會在台灣看他們的演出，並跟他們深入討論。例如當時臨界點劇象錄的藝術總監田啟元，他得了愛滋病後臨終前還到香港探訪榮念曾，「他很絕望，我們有很多討論，關於身體和劇場的關係。他們來了香港，跟我聊了很久。」。<a target="_blank"

由此可見，榮念曾在台灣第二代小劇場的某些年輕人的心目中，的確有點「劇場導師」甚至生命導師的況味，這在台灣當時一片反權威與反父權的時代氛圍下，的確別具意味。</p><p>若論進念/榮念曾對台灣小劇場發展的影響之深，大概要數黃承晃的「筆記劇場」，尤其是黃承晃本人。「筆記劇場」正式成立於 1985 年 5 月，隨即在新象小劇場演出《流言》與《舊約》等兩個作品。《流言》是根據榮念曾的劇本《舊約》所做的演出，而《舊約》則是由筆記自己團員集體創作而成的七個女孩子的戀愛故事。根據黃承晃自己的解釋，這種劇本名稱上的混淆，「有想像不到的新鮮感，我們就這樣做了。」[16] 這種看似無所謂的態度，若果被理解為黃承晃對他的「劇場導師」甚至生命導師榮念曾的戲謔式的致敬，大概也不為過 (注留﹕1984 年訪台的演出《百年之孤寂第二年》，副題為﹕「往事與流言」)。</p><p>事實上，進念在 1980 年代兩次訪台時，黃承晃看了他們的演出便甚為喜歡，事後也跟榮念曾經常交換意見。而且早在 1985 年成立「筆記劇場」以前，他已向榮念曾拿過劇本，在 1984 年 11 月推出演出《情蝕》。可見進念/榮念曾對黃承晃/筆記劇場的影響之深。根據鍾明德的分析，雖然《情蝕》、《流言》與《舊約》等演出內容上都不脫男歡女愛的快感與疼痛，但在美學形式上已跟蘭陵劇坊或表演工作坊等「實驗劇」不同，演出中演員已經不再扮演角色，對白常常呈現為機械性的獨白或反覆，整體風格往「非個人性、非劇情性、非再現性演出方式」的後現代劇場方向走，<a target="_blank"

而這明顯受到進念/榮念曾作品中的非敍事劇場風格的直接影響。</p><p>當然，1980 年代初進念與台灣小劇場的交流也不是單向的。記得筆者 1980 年代中開始先後在進唸的禮頓道與灣仔會所留連的日子，便有機會透過錄像帶觀賞雲門舞集、表演工作坊等台灣現代舞與第一代小劇場的作品。而這種港台之間頗原始的作品交流方式，往後卻造就了更多意想不到的「文化交流」﹕</p><blockquote><p>我清楚記得，賴聲川把他所有作品的 Copy 都給了我們。然後有一次賴聲川台北辦公室淹水，他們所有的材料都丟失了。他們問我，當時給你的材料能不能複製一份給我們。這是我印象很深的，這是關於交流。原來也有這樣的作用，當我要重建歷史時，我們的紀錄丟失了，可以問對方拿回來。</p></blockquote><figure class="image"><img

年代，進念對外交流的活動更頻繁，規模也更大，在《中國旅程 1997》、《中國旅程 1998》和《中國旅程 1999》等演出交流系列中，香港與台灣更被置放在一個更大跨城市、跨地域的網絡中進行深度文化交流。</p><p>其實早在 1980 年代，透過跟中國內地與台灣的交流，榮念曾已察覺到香港「可以是中國和台灣中間的重要平台，讓大家可以心平氣和地去討論。我看見中國的很多習性是比較自我中心的。我覺得台灣也是。這很多時候都啟發我們思考香港的重要性。因為我們都沒什麼自我中心，大家都在很放鬆的狀態。」<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

況且當時在香港你選甚麼題材也可以，在香港討論台灣是百無禁忌的，這是香港當時的優勢。[19]</p><p>來到九七後連續三年的《中國旅程》系列就進一步把文化交流擴至北京、上海等其他中國城市，甚至新架坡等華文世界。跟 1980 年代的文化交流不同，除了規模更大外，《中國旅程》已不止看作品、看看誰的演出比較精彩，而透過特定形式 (一桌兩椅、兩個演員，每個導演只有 20 分鐘演出時間) 創造出一個交流的平台，看看「不同的文化背景怎麼處理時間、空間、演員、資源的侷限」。<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

換言之，透過這種形式主義的文化交流模式設定，更能比對出不同地方在創意、文化甚至政治上的同和異。</p><p>這樣説來，《中國旅程》系列的形式主義文化交流模式，其實一早已蘊含在進念那種結構性很強的劇場美學風格之內。在《龍舞》、《中國旅程之五》、《百年之孤寂》、《列女傳》等作品中，進念都是由一些文化符號出發，建構一個有足夠開放度的框架，讓觀眾可以在內容上自行填補，它們需要觀眾「參與其中的、需要投放一個想法」。説到底，「文化交流一般都是借別人來講自己的東西的」，<a

meet,</p><p>Childhood memories,</p><p>The city of heaven,</p><p>Youthful days like a bean's bloom.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In the tumultuous years,</p><p>In a crimson safe,</p><p>Found relative tranquility,</p><p>The foundation of life,</p><p>The accumulation of thought,</p><p>In the service of the green military uniform.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Youth in full bloom,</p><p>Creative and brilliant thoughts,</p><p>Stunning poetry,</p><p>A decade of spirited freedom,</p><p>Rowing waves, boldly forward,</p><p>Accompanied by noble souls,</p><p>The literary road stretches ahead.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In that year of historical turning, from clear to cloudy,</p><p>Crossing the ocean far away,</p><p>The enthusiasm of a seeker,</p><p>The loneliness of a stranger,</p><p>The freshness of an outsider,</p><p>The loneliness of a yellow girl,</p><p>Interwoven,</p><p>Sometimes sleepless,</p><p>Sometimes in dreams,</p><p>Restless hearts.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>She is not just herself,</p><p>She is a reflection of those Eastern scholars studying abroad for years,</p><p>A testimony of a hundred years of Chinese men and

life.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Diligent and enduring,</p><p>Enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens,</p><p>Young girls and small fish,</p><p>Representing the outstanding qualities of

spirit of literati,</p><p>In the midst of disaster, they are repeatedly polished,</p><p>Transformed into smooth labor reform convicts,</p><p>Tattered clothing and plagued by illness,</p><p>But their

end of life,</p><p>Is not the end of the soul.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The adaptation on the screen,</p><p>Loses the themes and essence,</p><p>Lacks depth and courage,</p><p>Where is the

                <![CDATA[<p>一個世紀以前，愛因斯坦的相對論將我們的理解推向了一個全新的高度。他的理論不僅揭示了時間和空間的深層關係，而且提醒我們每一刻的價值。然而，我們是否真的理解了這樣的信息，並且在我們短暫且寶貴的生命中體現出來呢？</p><p>相對論認為時間是相對的，不同的觀察者將會有不同的時間感知。這一點在我們繁忙的日常生活中有時會體現得淋漓盡致。當我們忙碌於工作，疲於奔波時，時間似乎在無聲無息中飛逝。然而，當我們在休閒時刻，或者在等待某件重要事情的來臨時，時間又彷彿遲緩地流動。我們每天都在時間的擺盪中，奔波勞碌，而生命的沙漏卻在不停地流逝。</p><p>我們是不是因為生活中的種種繁雜，而忽視了生命中的美好與獨特呢？我們是否過於專注於追求物質的富足，而忽視了心靈的富足呢？愛因斯坦的相對論提醒我們，時間是個相對的概念，每一刻都擁有其獨特的價值。我們是否能夠深刻理解這個道理，並且在生活中實踐呢？</p><p>我們的生命就像是一艘在時間海洋中的船，每一刻都在向前進。我們不能停止時間的流逝，也不能回到過去。我們所能做的，只是掌握好舵，確保我們的航向。我們需要學習欣賞每一刻，珍惜每一刻，因為這些都是我們生命中的獨特瞬間。</p><p>生活中有許多美好的事物值得我們去欣賞和珍惜，如家人的笑聲、朋友的陪伴、自然的美景、書籍的智慧、美食的滋味、音樂的旋律...這些都是我們在時間的海洋中的小島，是我們在奔波勞碌的生活中的驛站。我們需要學會停下腳步，去欣賞這些生活中的美好，去體驗這些獨特的瞬間。</p><p>在繁忙的生活中，我們有時會感到迷茫和困惑，但我們需要記住，只有珍惜每一刻，我們才能真正體驗生活的價值。就像愛因斯坦的相對論一樣，我們的生活也是相對的，每一刻都有其獨特的價值和美。</p><p>所以，讓我們慢下腳步，去欣賞生活中的每一刻。</p>

                <![CDATA[<p><br class="smart">中國數字時代：新一輪巴以衝突產生以來，國內輿論場上對哈馬斯的恐怖主義，及其虛偽「正義性」做了很深入地分析、揭露，這是很有價值的。但是國內的知識階層出現了一種矯枉過正的傾向，他們選擇性忽略巴以衝突的複雜現實，以及形成中的是非曲直，對以色列無盡的道德美化、合法化辯護......（文章鏈接：阜成門六號院｜我毫不同情哈馬斯，但也不接受無底線美化以色列）</p><p></p><p>我：這篇文章非常好</p><p></p><p>「以色列的確充滿先進文明的國家，它是中東第一個民主國家，科技、教育上都創造了偉大成就，但是這種文明只是在本國國界內、對自己人的文明」</p><p>我們不要忽視了很多「文明」是有嚴格物理和人羣界限的，如果故意忽略它對別人不文明一面，一味地喊「站在文明一邊」就成了助紂為虐，就成了愚蠢。」</p><p>這段説的非常好</p><p></p><p>Mario Nawfal：（翻譯）埃胡德-巴拉克關於加沙的建議</p><p>以色列前總理埃胡德-巴拉克建議埃及、阿聯酋和摩洛哥共同組建一支阿拉伯維和部隊：</p><p>"以色列將屈服於國際壓力，將加沙交給一支阿拉伯維和部隊，其中可能包括埃及、摩洛哥和阿拉伯聯合酋長國。他們將確保該地區的安全，直到巴勒斯坦權力機構能夠控制該地區"。</p><p>資料來源：《經濟學人》</p><p></p><p>朱韻和：（轉發並翻譯了這篇推文）</p><p></p><p>我：這個建議其實很不錯</p><p></p><p>Aric Toler：以色列和美國情報官員認為，在阿赫利阿拉伯醫院爆炸前不久，視頻中捕捉到的一枚射彈是巴勒斯坦火箭彈。</p><p>@nytimes 目視調查發現該物體是從以色列發射的，可能與致命爆炸無關</p><p></p><p>Michael Anti：紐約時報的視覺調查記者仔細合併了 5 個當場的直播視頻，並且全部在地圖上做了回溯，認為當時的確有以色列的某種炮彈（比如鐵穹）參與，但到底加沙醫院誰炸的，他們也無法分析出，僅證明以方證據不夠。【這個調查做了個寂寞啊，我要是值班主編，肯定讓他們調查清楚了再發布】</p><p></p><p>我：就是鐵穹攔了哈馬斯火箭彈，然後在醫院上空或者臨地爆炸。現在發佈是要趕上時效。等完全搞清楚，這場戰爭可能都結束了</p><p></p><p>以色列在中國：從今晚起，這裏就在我們的大使館 —— 直到他們獲得自由。</p><p></p><p>在加沙地帶，有 200 多名人質被哈馬斯恐怖分子劫持。其中包括嬰兒、兒童、年輕婦女、十幾歲的男孩和女孩以及老年人。</p><p></p><p>我們緬懷並哀悼在 10 月 7 日的大屠殺中被哈馬斯恐怖分子殺害的無辜以色列平民。</p><p></p><p>分享並幫助我們傳播關於被綁架的無辜者的消息，並把他們帶回家。（視頻）</p><p></p><p>我：希望她/他們重獲自由。也希望加沙人民都得到自由</p><p></p><p>visegrad 24 ：（翻譯）Fahima Karim，@UAInst 的學生和 Marie Andersen，WUM 的學生。（兩張圖片，這兩個學生分別在不同場合，舉着「讓世界乾淨」並把以色列（國旗）丟進垃圾桶的海報。）</p><p></p><p>我：這當然也是惡的。雖然以色列欺凌巴勒斯坦，但全世界穆斯林圍攻以色列，也是以大欺小、以多欺少。暗示種族清洗更是可恥</p><p></p><p>Piers Morgan Uncensored：（翻譯）以色列前總理納夫塔利·貝內特表示，約旦女王拉尼婭指責以色列是種族隔離國家時「完全撒謊」。</p><p></p><p>「拉尼婭女王感到羞恥，她感到羞恥。她能説出這些公然的謊言，這真是令人遺憾。」</p><p></p><p>陳軍：公平起見，我昨天轉發了約旦皇后有關的視頻，今天轉發以色列前總理（2021-2022）在電視上對其的反駁。</p><p></p><p>他舉了例子證明在以色列有巴勒斯坦人擔任最高法官等，所以以色列治下不存在種族隔離。</p><p></p><p>我：曾國藩擔任兩江總督，就沒有滿漢區隔了？美國南北戰爭時南方也有黑人軍人，所以沒有種族隔離了嗎？對了抗戰期間，汪精衞、溥儀名義上還比駐中國日軍司令地位高呢。實際上呢？</p><p>另外，以色列有兩成巴裔公民，但還有更多巴裔沒有公民權，只能打工。當然這也是以色列怕巴裔太多鳩佔鵲巢。但的確是種族隔離</p><p></p><p>Safarier03 Liam：又一個虛假信息：在巴勒斯坦社交媒體上廣泛傳播的「在加沙去世的兒童」照片集中，至少有一名兒童被證明是在 2021 年 5 月哈馬斯的火箭襲擊中喪生的以色列兒童，其他兒童照片的來源尚不清楚。</p><p></p><p>(哪怕只有一個，就足以證明他們在説謊欺騙世界)（圖片）</p><p></p><p></p><p>瑞典茉莉：拜登説過，他對巴勒斯坦方面公佈的數據持懷疑態度。</p><p></p><p>哈馬斯的每一句話都不能信。他們是一羣兇殘狡詐無恥的人。</p><p></p><p>我：六四時候還有人謠傳王丹被殺，後來顯然沒死。難道可以否認六四時候中共殺了一些學生嗎？</p><p></p><p>大聲：《外交事務》這篇文章，分析了對巴勒斯坦人過去幾年的多次民調，有助瞭解那裏的人們究竟在想什麼，他們最真切的希望和失望。比如，在這次衝突發生之前，相比以色列的長期封鎖，加沙地帶人民更加反對的是哈馬斯的統治。（鏈接）</p><p></p><p>我：孤證不立，除非更多媒體、學術和民調機構，有起碼 50% 佐證巴勒斯坦人討厭哈馬斯勝過以色列。單獨一篇文章，選擇性找幾個民調，不能説明問題。</p><p>看看台灣民調，不同媒體結果差別太大了，選擇的樣本不同，提問誘導性差異、統計方式不同，結果大相徑庭。</p><p>哈馬斯的確不是善類，但在巴人那裏，比以色列口碑好</p><p></p><p>Quds News Network：（翻譯）以色列記者吉迪恩·利維（Gideon Levy）：「我不記得在哪一次佔領中，佔領者將自己表現為受害者。」（視頻）</p><p></p><p>我：以色列國內、各國猶太人，都很多有良心的，倒是中國一幫人替以色列侵略者搖旗吶喊、各種粉飾甚至稱頌</p><p></p><p>無論個人之間還是族羣之間，各種惡性競爭、利益衝突，以及形成的惡劣社會環境，不可能只靠單方妥協來和解與改變。那樣只有善良守序者吃虧、損人利己者得利。</p><p>比如插隊，壞人插隊好人排隊，那好人就一直排不上；比如酒店大廳打電話，大家都大喊大叫、你小聲不打擾別人，那你反而不能正常通話</p><p></p><p>中國自由派支持以色列，其實本質都是社達心理和「敵反對就支持」的扭曲心態作祟。其實他們還不如明確説「反正我就支持強者、支持以色列、支持中共反對的/反對中共支持的」，而不要再找各種具體藉口，例如同情以色列婦女兒童。這更加虛偽和狡辯。因為按社達理論，婦女兒童不應該得到比成年男性更多的同情</p><p></p><p>我同情加沙人民，但也認為應警惕伊斯蘭極端主義和保守主義，以及它對世界的影響。</p><p>最近在世界各地爆發的穆斯林反以色列示威，名義上是同情弱者、民族解放，但也有強烈的宗教色彩、排他性、極端性。如果他們成為世界主導力量，絕不會比現在西方主導更講人權和包容。</p><p>這一點上我是同意秦暉部分觀察觀點的</p><p></p><p>不僅 Metoo，國際關係方面，涉及到各種衝突糾紛，在是非不完全清楚或者雙方對錯參半情況下，人們（尤其有影響力的知識分子）應該更多同情弱勢方、受害方，而把指責和壓力更多給強勢方、加害方，這樣才能形成某種衡平。</p><p>另外，侵害和受害不能只看某個點上具體事、斷代為史，還要看前因和全局、整體性評判</p><p></p><p>我：關於最近的巴以衝突、中東博弈、國際關係，可以回看一下劉慈欣的《三體》，裏邊有不少情節結合當今現實，頗是有價值和耐人尋味。</p><p>裏邊價值觀是偏社達的，但講的一些事實、道理、喻示，是很震撼和深刻的。奧巴馬就高度評價了《三體》，同樣是看到了其中的深刻之處。</p><p>大家可以回想回看一下</p><p></p><p>《三體》中不僅有直接提及巴以衝突、反映人類冤冤相報的內容，還有一些情節，或者説整個三體，都在反映族羣衝突、爾虞我詐、生存競爭。</p><p>其中一部分，講人類在自認為取得軍事優勢後，對三體同情和尊敬，希望和平共處。而三體人則利用了人類同情和放鬆警惕，派遣水滴襲擊了人類艦隊，將人類逼向滅亡</p><p></p><p>我寫的《三體》書評，專門評論過這部分內容。</p><p>劉慈欣所寫的，其實是人類各族羣之間的真事。生存競爭是殘酷的，人們之間是難以信任乃至相互欺騙的。善良、同情、信任，反在這種叢林社會下被坑死。從司馬懿賺殺曹爽，到毛澤東鎮反殺死百萬起義國軍，還有納粹屠殺猶太人和南京大屠殺，殘暴都以欺騙為手段</p><p></p><p>悉尼維尼 Sydney Winnie：國內的民族主義已經到了這個程度了嗎？</p><p>看到以色列的東西就直接罵？（圖片，國內互聯網平台網友使用各種惡毒言辭辱罵以色列）</p><p></p><p>我：這些人是被惡意引導，將本來是中共政權壓迫造成的痛苦，轉移到仇恨美國、辱罵以色列。而且他們也並不真心同情加沙人民，無非是藉機發泄而已</p><p></p><p>硅谷碼農：一道選擇題讓我想起一個傳説：在內戰中曾有共軍壓着百姓向國軍陣地進攻。我懷疑其真實性。但假定為真，那麼國軍應不應該開槍？開槍就會殺死平民百姓。不開槍就只有認輸（投降或撤退）。這與加沙的情形或有不同，因為現在以軍是攻方而非守方。但相同點在於另一方都使用人盾。我認為罪責在人盾使用者。</p><p></p><p>我：那如果國軍不得已帶着大批百姓逃難，中共追擊並以剿匪為名射殺國軍和百姓，應不應該呢？</p><p></p><p>小徑殘雪：巴勒斯坦現狀。西岸，伯利恆，一座露天監獄。/1（許多圖片，巴勒斯坦人生活在像監獄的環境中（或者説就是監獄），許多兒童沒有童年，或者説童年都在戰爭中度過）</p><p></p><p>我：所以我早説了，從這裏殺出去的人，做什麼也不奇怪。讓生活在痛苦絕望中的人們，還遵守道德，純屬慷他人之慨。再説殺以色列婦女兒童的，都已經被以軍消滅了啊</p><p></p><p>唐丹鴻：世界上和歷史上，通常戰爭結束的方式有如下幾種：</p><p>佔領</p><p>投降</p><p>耗散（少數情況）</p><p>單方面撤軍</p><p>停火</p><p>外部強制中斷</p><p>停火前後的妥協和協議。</p><p></p><p>聯合國應該知道，達成停火的最快路線是：哈馬斯在屠殺 1,400 多名以色列人後，現在立刻釋放全部人質並投降。</p><p></p><p>我：那誰來保障此後加沙人民的安全呢？以後加沙能否被解除封鎖隔離？或者壓迫還會加劇？</p><p>另外，我看很多自由派和東突人士，在新疆問題上可不是這麼想的。沒覺得要維族放棄抵抗中共，屈服於陳全國，換取新疆和平，反而一致指責中共鎮壓是包括髮生暴恐襲擊的新疆衝突根源</p><p></p><p>我一直以為反對新疆再教育營的，肯定都是反對以色列侵佔巴勒斯坦、壓迫加沙人民的。尤其是自由派學者肯定如此。</p><p>現在看顯然不是這樣，非常雙重標準。哪怕以色列壓迫加沙的力度、造成人員死亡，其實是超過新疆集中營的。</p><p>選擇性的關心，呵呵</p><p></p><p>另外，作為旅居以色列的學者，應該儘可能保持客觀中立，而不是因為在那裏享受到以政府和公民的各種服務、幫助、友愛，就不分青紅皁白的站在以色列一邊。</p><p>同樣，像旅居日本的一大票中國人，因為在日本得到一些好於中國國內的生活，就賣身投靠，各種跪舔日本，也是非常噁心的。在美歐的也應該儘可能中立</p><p></p><p>我：不僅 Metoo，國際關係方面，涉及到各種衝突糾紛，在是非不完全清楚或者雙方對錯參半情況下，人們（尤其有影響力的知識分子）應該更多同情弱勢方、受害方，而把指責和壓力更多給強勢方、加害方，這樣才能形成某種衡平。</p><p>另外，侵害和受害不能只看某個點上具體事、斷代為史，還要看前因和全局、整體性評判</p><p></p><p>我：以色列這些天殺害的巴勒斯坦人包括婦女兒童，是前些天哈馬斯突擊造成死亡的起碼十幾倍，而且數字仍然在迅速增長。</p><p>不僅這本身就是不人道的殘暴行徑，即便從「以牙還牙」角度，也足夠報復了。現在停止，也就算了。巴勒斯坦人也不可能被消滅。以色列應該撤軍了</p><p></p><p></p><p>聯合早報 Lianhe Zaobao：新加坡支持聯合國大會緊急特別會議通過的決議，呼籲為加沙受害者繼續提供人道主義援助，保護加沙平民的生命。（鏈接）</p><p></p><p>我：支持</p><p></p><p>C Nguyen：（翻譯）有趣的是，新加坡投票支持約旦關於加沙人道主義休戰的決議，而印度卻投了棄權票。新加坡與以色列的關係有着悠久的歷史，並且有傳聞稱以色列幫助建立了新加坡軍隊。</p><p></p><p>我：新加坡的立場是兼顧現實與人道，非常好</p><p></p><p>BBC News 中文：【一週熱點回顧】被哈馬斯擄走的超過 200 名以色列人質都是誰？BBC 整理了他們的經歷。（鏈接）</p><p></p><p>我：希望巴勒斯坦哪怕 1% 的死難者的故事，也能被如此關注和報道</p><p></p><p>ABC News：一場嚴峻的信息戰與以色列和加沙的人身暴力並行，雖然這種形式的戰爭與戰爭本身一樣古老，但在社交媒體的幫助下，它現在正在大規模實時發生。（鏈接）</p><p></p><p>我：沒錯，信息戰就是戰爭一部分，在看似文明的現代社會更是重要</p><p></p><p>Snow FlakeZero：如果以色列能在中東地區推進土改，懲戒綠蝻，解放婦女，批鬥阿訇，強推世俗化，幫助中東工業化，派掃盲隊下鄉，推廣義務教育和醫療，那我願稱以色列為「正義之師」，我絕對支持以色列解放整個中東</p><p></p><p>可惜以色列不是，以色列只想搶點地盤，把阿拉伯人趕進缺水缺電的大監獄裏，拿導彈無差別對婦女兒童開</p><p></p><p>我：沒錯</p><p></p><p>MASK

2018 年一份地緣政治刊物上的專論，題目是：猶太復國主義的本質。</p><p></p><p>我不瞭解他對猶太復國主義的解讀多大程度上代表了普京或某些俄羅斯精英的看法，但他文章所暗示的結論和目前一些流行的看法有呼應的部分：巴以衝突是千年宗教衝突的延續····（下面內容太長省略）</p><p></p><p>我：杜金對於猶太復國主義及巴以衝突、阿拉伯世界與西方的衝突的觀點，其實就是發動俄烏戰爭理論的延續。杜金和許多俄羅斯保守派認為，西方已在同性戀、多元化、女權、世俗主義之類東西下「墮落」了，並且被包括猶太人在內「深層政府」控制。發動俄烏戰爭，就是為了擊敗西方「深層政府」。</p><p>這套東西蠱惑了很多人</p><p></p><p>陳軍：問題是，內塔尼亞胡也用這樣《舊約》的部分敍事邏輯，我們就自然會看到土耳其總統的反應····。以巴衝突無論短期如何解決，它所留下的隱患，可能在未來以更慘烈的方式爆發。</p><p></p><p>許多歷史上大事件的結局，往往和「自我實現的預言」有關，和各民族的自我認同有關，而和其內容否對錯無關。</p><p></p><p>我：這的確是自我實現和惡性循環。但如果直接沒有民族和教派意識，只會被其他勢力吞噬，而不會真的和平或者獨善其身。從古至今，人們都以族羣形式存在，當今人類社會也不例外。只能通過某種平衡，而不是放棄民族認同。或者説有辦法讓所有民族宗教都放下狹隘的身份成為世界公民，而不能只要求一部分人這麼做</p><p></p><p>這就像裁軍、廢除核武器，不能要求單方面放棄，而是要雙方一起裁減。我裁了你不裁，那以後你打過來怎麼辦？</p><p>民族主義和教派主義也是這樣。它的確是一種狹隘的意識形態，只顧自己族羣。但物以類聚人以羣分，就像家庭一樣，也是狹隘但卻根深蒂固。而且存在價值觀、習俗、語言等差異，也難真的大同</p><p></p><p>老魚吹牛皮 Bill1st：以色列部長提議土耳其接收加沙居民</p><p></p><p>「我不僅可以讓他們能得到在遠方的埃爾多安的支持，還可以將他們置於他的保護之下，可以讓他們去土耳其生活。」 - 以色列國家安全部長本·格維爾。</p><p></p><p>我：我覺得埃爾多安應該同意一下。另外中國新疆的維族，如果願意去土耳其，中國政府也應該行方便，不僅不能阻攔還要送路費</p><p></p><p>Michael Anti：拜登政府對以色列友善這點就不説了，問題是這個政府同時也對殺戮記者、支持各地極端主義的沙特政府也友善。以色列遊説有錢，但海灣國家也有錢。所以這事在美國內部不會很快結束，雙方定會繼續撒錢影響美國外交政策。</p><p></p><p>我：沙特其實和以色列是友好關係，不是敵對的</p><p></p><p>Michael Anti：支持巴勒斯坦的美國人發誓不投拜登也沒意義，因為難道你想讓川普上台？拜登政府吃定你們最後含淚投票。</p><p></p><p>我：希拉里也是這麼想的，然後就悲劇了</p><p></p><p>Dr. Eli David：（翻譯）意大利：LGBTQ+ 🏳️‍🌈示威支持巴勒斯坦🇵🇸</p><p></p><p>我想知道他們會在巴勒斯坦對他們做什麼🤔（視頻）</p><p></p><p>我：LGBTQ 支持巴勒斯坦，同情弱勢，這個沒錯。不過大多數伊斯蘭國家都是禁止 LGBTQ 的。現在哈馬斯法塔赫支持 LGBTQ，究竟是真心還是權宜，不太好説。我覺得權宜和統戰成分大一些。和中共當年爭取進步學生差不多。不當權就要把朋友搞得多多的、敵人少少的，但當權就翻臉了</p><p></p><p>Michael Anti：「從河到海」是巴勒斯坦人對 1948 年前巴勒斯坦全部地區的代稱。具體可以看哈馬斯 2017 年新綱領《一般原則和政策文件》：「巴勒斯坦東起約旦河，西至地中海，北起納古拉角，南至烏姆拉什拉什，是一個完整的領土單元。」 但在同一個文件中，哈馬斯不反對 1967 年邊界作為全民談判起步。（鏈接）</p><p></p><p>我：其實出於安全舒適考慮，以色列應該建國在歐洲，或者南美，而不是中東。即便考慮到耶路撒冷是聖城，也不應該在那。現在這樣阿以雙方都痛苦。而西方支持以色列在中東建國，也是楔釘子，居心不良</p><p></p><p>巴勒斯坦人受難，以色列也要天天防着周邊阿拉伯各國還有伊朗，近的火箭彈覆蓋以色列全境，遠的中程導彈也完全覆蓋以國。這情況下以色列才拼命發展包括核武在內各種武器、動不動跨境定點清除先發制人。然後仇怨越來越大，沒辦法和解。這比《三體》裏地球和三體的互相威懾還要緊張可怕，而這本來可以避免</p><p></p><p>Michael Anti：當時二戰更結束，猶太人被屠殺幾百萬，西方社會一面倒愧疚。</p><p></p><p>我：那不更應該在歐洲建國嗎？慷阿拉伯人之慨算什麼</p><p></p><p>Michael Anti：那畢竟復國主義者已經移民過去不少人了。</p><p></p><p>Y

年之久的泥沼。</p><p></p><p>以色列這次反擊哈馬斯我看結果也會一樣，所謂消滅哈馬斯這一説，除了轟炸加沙以報復巴勒斯坦以外，沒有可證明他們正在消滅哈馬斯。同時，他們不在乎已經接近要談成的亞伯拉罕協議和前面和阿聯酋，巴林的合作協議，也不在乎他們的做法將留下多少後患，包括伊朗，土耳其，中國和俄國的捲入，這樣不明智之舉，只有背後有不可告人的目的才可以解釋。</p><p></p><p>在我看來，內塔尼亞胡目前的做法是有幾種可能性的解讀，受國內極端猶太復國主義的挾持，不得不做出這種反應；轉移他自己面臨的個人和執政方面普遍的不滿情緒，還有將美國更深的拖入到中東地區的衝突中，利用美國的威懾力拿下更多的巴勒斯坦土地，後者這一點，完全不是美國的利益所在。</p><p></p><p>預估一下未來的發展：以色列因遭受哈馬斯恐怖襲擊所得到的同情和支持正在失去，他們不希望看到的反猶主義正在朝着相反的方向發展，同時他們國際上日益孤立（聯合國大會中，反對停火的大國只有美國，歐盟許多國家已經開始公開表示了對以色列過度使用暴力的不滿）阿拉伯國家對以色列的敵意升高，伊朗和土耳其已經明示有可能以軍事方式捲入。做為北約成員國，土耳其的立場已經讓情況變得更復雜。俄羅斯前總統梅德韋傑夫最近放話，俄羅斯將不得不與北約正面衝突，戰爭的規模將超過 1945 年的二戰……中國正在利用這場危機擴大在該地區的影響力，並在西方聯盟之外利用擴大版的金磚四國體系挑戰美國，如果此刻美國民主黨當政的政府處理不當，這將給川普更大的機會捲土重來，如是第三次世界大戰的風險就會接近 70% 以上。</p><p></p><p>總之，內塔尼亞胡目前所做的一切，不僅他個人會付出代價，以色列也會付出代價，世界其它地區也會付出相應的代價。世界上沒有一個重大的失誤而無需付出代價的。只是這種代價通過戰爭來支付的話，那將是無數平民百姓的生命消逝，另外，它還會為將到而未到的更大的戰爭，更多的死亡鋪平道路····</p><p></p><p>所以不要鼓吹暴力，人類祈求什麼將會得到什麼。</p><p></p><p>善用刀劍者將死於刀劍之下。歷史已經反覆證明過這一點，我們今天不需要再用更多，更新鮮的血再次證明這一點。</p><p></p><p>我：我的看法一直是折中的。即一方面不贊同美以極右派那種「消滅穆斯林」、「通過戰爭將獨裁國家顛覆，且不惜平民傷亡代價」，但同時也不贊同極左反戰人士「被恐怖襲擊也不還手，用愛感化」，或者將第三世界對西方國家的攻擊都視為文明衝突或者反殖民。</p><p>反恐是必要的，但打擊要有定向和限度，更多要去改造和建設</p><p></p><p>很多事情還要具體分析區別對待。就像阿富汗戰爭和伊拉克戰爭，我就支持前者、反對後者。前者是高度教權專制、壓迫女性和弱勢族羣，還包庇恐怖組織。而伊拉克雖然獨裁，但薩達姆政權相對於沙特、敍利亞等其他國家，暴政並不突出。美國打擊缺乏足夠理由，弊大於利。但打了之後，那也就打了，但要做好善後</p><p></p><p>我相信慕容雪村先生的同情是真誠的，而不是賣人設。我也同意他在巴以問題上一些看法。</p><p>但有時候，他又用力過猛，一下子完全站在穆斯林立場，包括批判漢族、中國，不是客觀中立，而是為反而反，一些行為又和中共五毛一體兩面了。例如柴靜拍穆斯林暴恐紀錄片，他激動的表達擔憂</p><p></p><p>就像我在柏林勃蘭登堡門遇到的這些反戰人士，反對軍事援助烏克蘭，認為以暴制暴不能帶來和平。還有歐美一些核裁軍人士，也認為自己國家要先放棄核武，才能促成無核化。我是很敬佩他們的。</p><p>但現實裏，這真的能促成和平嗎？你釋放善意，未必得到對等對待，乃至讓惡人更加得勢。停止軍援，普京會撤軍嗎？</p><p></p><p>我也去搞了活動勸説普京撤軍、俄烏和平。我還寫了長信敍述中俄友誼。但我也知道沒什麼用。普京不會聽我的，也不會聽哪怕各國總統的勸説，否則一開始就不會入侵烏克蘭了。真正可能讓普京退卻的，只有在軍事上擊敗他</p><p></p><p>小徑殘雪：一個歐洲阿拉伯人的質問。（內容是有人説阿拉伯人內部相互殺戮、腐敗、專制，所以不應該仇恨猶太人，而要關注內部的不公不義）</p><p></p><p>我：顯然對內對外要兼顧。而且涉及民族問題，那的確表達立場會更強烈一些。如果只對內不對外，那確實可以説是阿奸了。中共勾連蘇聯和日本，打國民政府，不也是這套説辭嗎？</p><p></p><p>陳軍：「王小山問慕容雪村，你説個不死平民抓哈馬斯的方案出來？後者推脫説這是專業問題。但實際上這個問題很嚴厲，不具備可行性的方案是不解決問題也不會被真正的成本承擔方所接納的。」</p><p></p><p>我的回答：</p><p></p><p>這個角度把別的方案的可能性排除了。</p><p></p><p>以色列開始有很多選項，其中之一就是加快和沙特恢復關係（這首先不讓哈馬斯迫害中東和平進程的策略成功）另外，繼續保持和阿聯酋巴林友好關係（目前巴林已經驅逐了以色列大使），以色列從受害者的角色出發，讓西方全部佔在他們這一邊，同時拉近本來中立一點的土耳其，埃及等國家，並利用阿拉伯國家的力量，孤立哈馬斯，並讓他們出面先解決人質問題。</p><p></p><p>換句話説，在危機面前，以色列先建立起聯合陣線，讓有些以色列自己辦不成的事，比如解散哈馬斯，交出首領等，交給其它中東國家出面去辦。這樣可以爭取全世界的人心，也最大程度的孤立了哈馬斯，同時找機會時定點清除他們的首腦，以達到他們最終」消滅」哈馬斯的目的。</p><p></p><p>同時，以色列回到原來既定的兩步方案，把兩國建國的方案交給聯合國投票解決。這樣以色列不僅會在國際社會上贏得廣泛的讚譽的支持，他們在中東地區性也因此會獲得更大的領導力。</p><p></p><p>現在這個窗口還有，但機會似乎變得越來越渺茫……</p><p></p><p>我：你説的這些，以色列本來就一直在做。而且，這些正是哈馬斯發動突擊及贏得加沙人支持的重要原因。正是因為中東各阿拉伯國家於以色列改善關係、逐漸放棄對巴勒斯坦的支持，才導致巴以矛盾激化，以及哈馬斯的絕望一擊</p><p></p><p>我幾個月前就評論過</p><p></p><p>沙以和解、沙伊和解，都居心不良。雖然局部有好處，但是對整體的和平大局，既沒有根本改善，還坑了弱勢羣體。特朗普推動的沙以和解，為了對付伊朗，還坑了巴勒斯坦；中國推動的沙伊和解，罔顧兩國人權問題，也迴避巴勒斯坦問題。</p><p>去年和今年我寫了兩篇文章，都談了</p><p></p><p>這兩個和解坑的最慘的就是巴勒斯坦。以前沙以、阿以博弈，巴勒斯坦雖然是棋子，但是畢竟得到阿拉伯各國道義支持，不承認以色列就是支持之一。沙以和解、阿聯酋巴林和以色列建交，等於把巴勒斯坦人拋棄了，幾十年的原則付之東流。</p><p>沙伊和解，兩國也不再指責對方國內人權、少數派權利自由，等於認同對方國內的鎮壓。例如沙特鎮壓國內什葉派包括處決教士；伊朗對內排斥遜尼派。</p><p></p><p>以前沒和解，雙方還制衡一下、呼籲和保護對面的弱勢族羣。現在和解了，並不是承諾保障好弱勢羣體。相反，對這些都不管了，乃至和解的代價就是默許對方鎮壓他們。還有雙方也能心照不宣的共同壓制女權運動什麼的……</p><p></p><p>這就跟 1972 年、1990 年，中美中日關係正常化差不多，看起來好，其實代價就是不顧人權、不顧受害者、不顧歷史，唯利是圖、踐踏弱者、進一步排斥邊緣者……</p><p></p><p>「這一對「巴以」的建交，受傷最深的，是另一個「巴以」關係中的巴勒斯坦。巴林跟隨阿聯酋的步伐與以色列關係正常化，證實了「多米諾骨牌效應」的發生，巴勒斯坦得到「阿拉伯兄弟」的道義支持將越來越少。各國為自身利益和叢林法則，紛紛「棄巴親以」，讓近年來越發在巴以博弈中處於不利境地的巴勒斯坦雪上加霜。悲哀的是，這個趨勢還將繼續下去，「多米諾骨牌」將不可遏止的繼續倒下，巴勒斯坦人民爭取獨立自由、民族解放的道路將更加漫長和絕望。」</p><p></p><p></p><p>我：起碼當下人類社會環境裏，求同情就像乞討，不僅經常沒用，得到了也不是好滋味。起碼比以暴制暴滋味更痛苦。</p><p>不僅巴勒斯坦人這樣想，其實對猶太人也一樣。如果哈馬斯襲擊後以色列不攻擊加沙，以純粹受害者身份當然可以博取更多同情支持。但以色列選擇以牙還牙，這説明以色列也覺得同情沒什麼用、滋味不好，而不如報復回去更爽。這從人道主義角度當然不對，但卻是客觀現實，也是各方受害者能深刻感知到</p><p></p><p>造謠、嘲笑弱勢，中國的反賊，和中共是一回事。而且他們嘲笑敢於反抗的弱者，那大抵在中共體制下當順民，比抗爭人士更合他們胃口</p><p>（類似的東西我沒有關注過，但是總是出現在推薦裏。有些拉黑有些沒拉黑，不拉黑是為了觀察這些人的價值觀、言行、心理。都拉黑就變成同溫層了）（圖片，推特上一些人造謠説五次中東戰爭都是巴勒斯坦挑起，以及嘲笑巴勒斯坦人弱還要反抗、「人菜癮大」）</p><p></p><p>visegrad

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p></p><h3><strong>按：以下文章最初由敍利亞/瑞士學者和馬克思主義國際主義者約瑟夫·達赫爾（&nbsp;Joseph Daher）於 2021 年 7 月 5 日在美國《暴風雨》（Tempest）網站上發表。作者感謝 Ashley Smith 和 Sai Englert 在文章撰寫中提供的幫助。</strong></h3><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>以色列最近在以色列國內、約旦河西岸和加沙地帶對巴勒斯坦人的襲擊再次展現了錫安主義國家的殘酷殖民主義、種族主義和類似種族隔離的本質。由極端民族主義者納夫塔利·貝內特（Naftali Bennett）領導的新聯盟取代以色列總理內塔尼亞胡政府，但這並不會改變巴勒斯坦人的處境。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>新政權的政策與內塔尼亞胡的政策沒有什麼不同。為了證明這一現實，貝內特在上台幾天後就下令對加沙進行新的空襲。<strong>這些新的暴力與鎮壓行為證明瞭國際左翼必須毫無條件地支持巴勒斯坦的抵抗。</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>但是，我們也必須參與關於如何贏得解放以及我們在其中的作用的戰略辯論。社會主義者應該將巴勒斯坦的鬥爭視為與中東和北非（MENA）反對該地區所有國家（尤其是以色列）的革命密不可分。將巴勒斯坦的抗爭與區域內的革命相結合，是實現巴勒斯坦以及該地區所有人民自由的唯一現實方式。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>以色列：一個定居者殖民國家</strong></h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>錫安主義運動（The Zionist movement&nbsp;），其在歐洲的起源，經過 1948 年建立以色列國，到如今導致巴勒斯坦人的流離失所，始終是一個定居者殖民主義項目。為了確立、保持和擴張其領土，以色列國家不得不從他們的土地、家園和職業上對巴勒斯坦人進行種族清洗。在整個過程中，它與帝國主義列強結盟，並得到了帝國主義列強的支持，首先是大英帝國，然後是美國，後者在反對阿拉伯民族主義和社會主義的鬥爭中利用以色列作為代理人。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>因此，以色列國家對錫安主義定居者在謝赫賈拉（Sheikh Jarrah&nbsp;）對巴勒斯坦人住宅的侵佔的支持，必須視作 1948 年導致超過 70 萬巴勒斯坦人被迫離開家園的那場 Nakba（阿拉伯語「大災難」）的持續。這一持續不斷的殖民過程，是目前有超過五百萬巴勒斯坦難民生活在中東和北非的難民營和城市中的原因。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>考慮到以色列徹底的反動本性，過去十年中，極右翼的政治霸權統治並不令人意外。從某種意義上説，這是錫安主義運動的合乎邏輯的產物......</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>現在，連主流團體也開始承認以色列殖民行為的反動本質。例如，人權觀察和以色列的 B'Tselem 最近都譴責以色列持續掠奪巴勒斯坦土地。他們記錄了以色列如何違反國際法，支持 62 萬殖民者在被佔領的約旦河西岸和東耶路撒冷地區建設殖民點。他們還斷言，以色列是一個實行種族隔離制度的國家，賦予猶太人特殊權利，並使得巴勒斯坦人成為二等公民。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>鑑於以色列的極端反動性質，極右翼在過去十年中的政治霸權應該不足為奇。從某種意義上説，它是錫安主義運動、民族主義、以色列的制度性種族主義及其七十多年來對巴勒斯坦人的壓迫和剝奪的合乎邏輯的產物。這些都為右翼錫安主義暴徒的蓬勃發展創造了條件，這些暴徒在巴勒斯坦社區遊行，高呼「阿拉伯人去死」 （Death to Arabs）。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>與專制政權的錯誤聯盟</strong></h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>就像殖民佔領和種族隔離下的任何其他人羣一樣，巴勒斯坦人有抵抗的權利，包括採取軍事手段。對這項權利的支持不應與對巴勒斯坦各政黨政治觀點的支持混為一談。無論是法塔赫、哈馬斯、伊斯蘭聖戰組織、巴勒斯坦人民解放陣線（PFLP）、巴勒斯坦民主解放陣線（DFLP）等，都沒有提出能夠實現巴勒斯坦解放的政治策略。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>主導的巴勒斯坦政黨並不把巴勒斯坦大眾、地區工人階級和被壓迫民眾當作贏得解放的力量。相反，他們試圖與該地區統治階層及其政權結成政治聯盟，以支持他們反對以色列的政治和軍事鬥爭。即便這些政權在其境內壓迫自己的民眾和巴勒斯坦人，他們還是與之合作，並主張不幹預。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>這種策略的演變中的一個關鍵例子是 1970 年的約旦，並在所謂的「黑色九月」事件中達到頂峯。儘管巴勒斯坦解放組織（PLO）在力量、組織和受歡迎度方面均表現突出，但在人口有七成是巴勒斯坦人的約旦，亞西爾·阿拉法特領導的法塔赫最初拒絕支持推翻國家獨裁者侯賽因國王的運動。在得到美國和以色列的支持以後，作為迴應，侯賽因宣佈戒嚴，並且在阿拉伯地區政府基本保持袖手旁觀的情況下，侯賽因攻擊了巴解組織的營地，殺害了數千名巴勒斯坦戰士和平民，並最終驅逐了巴解組織出境，使其進入了敍利亞和黎巴嫩。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>儘管有着這樣的歷史，以及隨後在流亡中的經歷，巴解組織幾十年來仍舊堅持這種合作與不幹預的策略。如今，巴勒斯坦自治當局（PA）主席馬哈茂德·阿巴斯支持阿卜杜勒·法塔赫·塞西在埃及的獨裁統治。在另一個令人震驚的例子中，儘管阿薩德殘酷鎮壓了參與敍利亞起義的巴勒斯坦人，並摧毀了耶爾穆克難民營，但阿巴斯最近還是向敍利亞獨裁者巴沙爾·阿薩德在 2021 年 5 月「再次當選」表示祝賀。</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>哈馬斯也採取了類似的策略；其領導層與海灣國家的君主制國家，尤其是近來的卡塔爾，以及伊朗的原教旨主義政權結成了聯盟。2012 年，當時擔任加沙哈馬斯政府總理的伊斯梅爾·哈尼耶讚揚了巴林的「改革」，與此同時，該政權在海灣盟友的支持下鎮壓了該國的民主起義。許多哈馬斯領導人將其視為伊朗支持的巴林什葉派的「宗派」政變。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2018 年 4 月，哈馬斯前領導人哈立德·馬沙爾在訪問安卡拉時讚揚了土耳其對敍利亞阿夫林的入侵和佔領。他表示，「土耳其在阿夫林的成功是一個堅實的榜樣」，希望這會被視為「世界許多地方伊斯蘭烏瑪取得類似勝利的希望」。土耳其武裝部隊及其在敍利亞的反動代理人佔領了阿夫林，導致大約 20 萬名庫爾德人被驅逐，並鎮壓了那些留下的人。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>遺憾的是，巴勒斯坦左翼在很大程度上採用了與此相似的策略。它同樣對盟友對其人民的壓迫行為緘默不語。例如，人民陣線（PFLP）沒有對敍利亞政權的罪行提出任何異議，反而支持其軍隊對抗‘外國陰謀’，聲稱大馬士革‘將繼續成為錫安主義敵人及其盟友面前的刺’。 人民陣線（PFLP）與伊朗的神權統治及埃及的軍事獨裁政權的關係，也呈現出類似的模式。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>政權背叛解放革命</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>該地區的專制國家非但沒有推進革命，反而一再背叛革命，甚至鎮壓巴勒斯坦人。如前所述，約旦政府在 1970 年鎮壓了巴勒斯坦運動，在黑色九月期間殺死了數千人並驅逐了巴解組織。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1976 年，敍利亞的哈菲茲·阿薩德政權介入黎巴嫩事務，支持黎巴嫩極右翼政黨，反對巴勒斯坦和左翼組織。他還在 1985 年和 1986 年對貝魯特的巴勒斯坦難民營採取了軍事行動。到 1990 年，大約有 2,500 名巴勒斯坦政治犯被關押在敍利亞監獄中。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>自 2007 年以來，埃及協助以色列對加沙地帶實施封鎖。伊朗投機取巧地試圖利用巴勒斯坦事業作為外交政策工具，以實現其在該地區的更廣泛目標。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>雖然敍利亞政權支持哈馬斯，但在 2011 年拒絕支持該政權反對民主起義的反革命時，它大幅削減了對哈馬斯的援助。伊朗只在伊斯梅爾·哈尼亞和薩利赫·阿魯裏被選為新領導後，才與哈馬斯恢復了正式關係。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>德黑蘭在阿富汗和伊拉克與美帝國主義合作。這就是為什麼在最近的伊拉克起義中，抗議者在「既不是美國，也不是伊朗」的口號下游行。僅這些例子就摧毀了伊朗是巴勒斯坦事業的可靠盟友或是一個反帝國主義國家的想法。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>儘管雷傑普·塔伊普·埃爾多安（Recep Tayyip Erdogan）批評以色列，但土耳其仍與以色列保持着密切的經濟聯繫。埃爾多安將與特拉維夫的貿易額從上台時的 14 億美元增加到 2020 年的 65 億美元。因此，這些政權將他們對這一事業的支持限制在促進其地區利益的領域，並在不促進其地區利益的領域背叛它。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>美帝國主義斡旋的和平協議的死衚衕</strong></h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>在依賴區域政權的政治支持和聯盟戰略失敗後，巴解組織轉而採取了更加走投無路的方式，那就是尋求美國和其他大國斡旋的和平協議。希望通過 1993 年達成的《奧斯陸協議》實現兩國解決方案。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>這種解決方案不僅不會實現巴勒斯坦的解放，反倒等同於屈服，接受以色列在歷史巴勒斯坦地區的殖民統治，而充其量只能贏得一個巴勒斯坦殘餘國家，並背叛巴勒斯坦難民返回他們在以色列被盜土地的權利。歸根結底，和平進程使巴勒斯坦權力機構淪為統治完全由以色列控制的班圖斯坦<a target="_blank"

href="https://matters.news/@MIAzh/%E5%B7%A6%E7%BF%BC%E7%9C%8B%E4%BB%A5%E5%B7%B4%E5%8D%B1%E6%9C%BA%E8%AF%91%E6%96%87%E8%BE%91no-16-%E5%B7%B4%E5%8B%92%E6%96%AF%E5%9D%A6%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%92%8C%E4%B8%AD%E4%B8%9C%E5%92%8C%E5%8C%97%E9%9D%9E%E9%9D%A9%E5%91%BD-palestinian-liberation-and-the-mena-revolutions-bafybeiaiznp3xhu674izmqnaxbbo2lg567lr7rogazltbrnhffibcaiswa#_ftn1">[1]</a>。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>這種災難性的結果應該不足為奇。美國和其他帝國主義列強一直支持以色列作為其在本地的執法力量，以對抗該地區可能對他們控制產生挑戰的革命性變革，這一事件將挑戰他們對其戰略能源儲備的控制。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>以色列自建國以來一再達到這一目的。1956 年，在蘇伊士運河國有化後，它參與了法國和英國對納賽爾埃及的進攻。1967 年，以色列的六日戰爭在激進的民族主義階段瞄準了納賽爾的埃及和敍利亞國家。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>從那時起，美國一直支持以色列。華盛頓平均每年向特拉維夫輸送 40 億美元，支持其在巴勒斯坦的殖民活動以及對該地區進步政府和組織的侵略戰爭。華盛頓支持以色列於 1978 年和 1982 年對黎巴嫩的軍事介入，這場介入導致了薩布拉和夏蒂拉惡劣的大屠殺，摧毀了進步的巴勒斯坦和黎巴嫩軍隊，並在貝魯特建立了一個友好的政權。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>以色列對阿拉伯民族主義國家的勝利及其對黎巴嫩的幹預導致該地區激進主義的後退，孤立了巴解組織。這一困境導致了亞西爾·阿拉法特的法塔赫派系在 1978 年採納兩國解決方案，這是其走向簽署 1993 年《奧斯陸協議》的必要步驟。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>華盛頓平均每年向特拉維夫注入 40 億美元，支持其殖民巴勒斯坦以及對該地區進步政府和運動發起的侵略戰爭。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>實際上，這意味着放棄歷史性解放巴勒斯坦的鬥爭，並將法塔赫轉變為管理被佔領土的巴勒斯坦權力機構。反對《奧斯陸協議》的巴勒斯坦知識分子愛德華·賽義德（Edward Said）宣稱，該協議代表了「對原則、巴勒斯坦歷史的主要潮流和國家目標的大規模放棄」，並「將散居海外的巴勒斯坦人降級為永久流亡或難民身份」。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>美國和以色列一直支持巴勒斯坦權力機構控制約旦河西岸和加沙地帶的巴勒斯坦人（在後者於 2007 年被哈馬斯接管之前）。巴勒斯坦權力機構很高興擔任華盛頓和特拉維夫的警察。例如，在最近的起義中，巴勒斯坦權力機構逮捕了 20 多名活動人士，因為他們在社交媒體上發帖並領導抗議活動。最近，巴勒斯坦主要活動家和巴勒斯坦權力機構的批評者尼扎爾·巴納特（Nizar Banat）在希伯倫杜拉（Dura）的家中遭到安全部隊的突襲。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>隨着巴勒斯坦權力機構作為一個狡猾的政權發揮作用，美國促進了以色列與該地區國家的政治和經濟一體化，最近通過特朗普政府的亞伯拉罕協議。以色列與幾個阿拉伯國家之間關係的正常化，這進一步孤立了巴勒斯坦的解放鬥爭。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>新當選的總統喬·拜登（Joe Biden）重申了華盛頓對以色列的堅定支持，無論以色列對巴勒斯坦人犯下什麼罪行。在對加沙最近的轟炸中，國會通過了向以色列出售 7.35 億美元的精確制導武器的協議，而每年數十億美元的援助也將繼續湧入。巴勒斯坦權力機構與美國合作的戰略需要向佔領者及其帝國贊助商投降。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>巴勒斯坦工人階級的軟弱</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>如果基於該地區國家和美國斡旋的和平協議的戰略是死衚衕，那麼對巴勒斯坦工人階級的另一種取向呢？這一點也被以色列作為定居者殖民國家的特殊性質所排除。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>與種族隔離的南非不同，南非的工廠和礦山依賴黑人工人的勞動，以色列將巴勒斯坦工人趕出了其經濟中的任何核心角色，取而代之的是猶太工人。因此，巴勒斯坦工人沒有辦法像南非的黑人工人那樣通過罷工來關閉以色列經濟。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>這並不意味着巴勒斯坦抵抗運動在以色列國內以及被佔領的西岸和加沙地帶無能為力。其他團體工人的鬥爭仍然是運動的核心。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>巴勒斯坦最近的鬥爭浪潮顯示了它的力量和潛力，可以制定一項新的戰略，以取代依賴該地區政權支持的失敗戰略。新的青年和女權主義團體，如塔拉特（Tal’at），以及工人階級，一直是最近抵抗運動的核心。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5 月 18 日的工人總罷工是自下而上召集和領導的。它關閉了從以色列到約旦河西岸和加沙地帶的部分經濟。正如《國土報》所指出的那樣：「以色列建築商協會觀察到巴勒斯坦工人蔘觀了罷工，六萬五千名巴勒斯坦建築工人中只有 150 人來到以色列工作。這導致建築工地癱瘓，造成估計為 1.3 億謝克爾（近 4000 萬美元）的損失。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>雖然罷工的性質極其重要，但不應過分誇大其影響。正如在約旦河西岸定居點工業區組織巴勒斯坦人的唯一以色列工會——MAAN 工人協會的主任阿薩夫·阿迪夫所指出的，巴勒斯坦在以色列工作的人遵守罷工在某種程度上是「由於檢查站的關閉和約旦河西岸道路上的不確定性」。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>無論參與罷工的廣度如何，以色列經濟都相對毫髮無損，這表明巴勒斯坦工人階級和其他社會運動需要其他工人、農民和被壓迫人民的聲援。問題是巴勒斯坦人應該以哪些為導向，以在歷史悠久的巴勒斯坦贏得世俗民主。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>以色列工人階級——不是戰略盟友</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>第一個也許是顯而易見的戰略方向似乎是以色列工人階級。但它始終將對以色列的忠誠高於與巴勒斯坦大眾的階級團結。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>這不僅是意識形態奉獻的結果，而且是對以色列國家的物質利益的結果，以色列國家為以色列工人提供了從巴勒斯坦人那裏偷來的房屋以及膨脹的生活水平。因此，以色列統治階級和國家將以色列工人階級納入作為共同定居者殖民主義項目的合作者。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>它的工人階級機構，如其工會，Histadrut，在巴勒斯坦的種族清洗中發揮了核心作用。錫安主義工黨領導人於 1920 年建立了一個 Histadrut，作為一個完全猶太人的工會，並用它來帶頭使巴勒斯坦工人流離失所。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>其口號「猶太土地、猶太工作、猶太產品」概括了它的民族主義階級合作項目，並凸顯了它與巴勒斯坦人團結的根本敵意。在以色列建國期間和建國後應用這些口號，它幫助確保土地只租給猶太人;農場和工業只僱用猶太人;巴勒斯坦的農場和工業遭到抵制。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>此外，以色列國家通過強制性徵兵使以色列工人軍事化的程度加深。這迫使他們參與對巴勒斯坦人的鎮壓，強化佔領，併為錫安主義者佔領巴勒斯坦人的房屋和土地辯護。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>考慮到這種納入殖民項目的情況，工人們支持對加沙的最新襲擊（除了極少數例外）也就不足為奇了。以色列電力公司（IEC）的工會甚至宣佈，在兩名以色列士兵和一名失蹤的以色列平民被遣返之前，它不會修復通往加沙地帶的電力線。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>這是否意味着巴勒斯坦人不應該尋求與以色列工人階級的進步部門合作？ 當然不是。小規模團結的例子是存在的，但很少見。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>很難想象這些會成為以色列工人與錫安主義國家民族主義團結的壓倒性模式的對立面。因此，專注於嘗試在以色列和巴勒斯坦工人之間建立反對錫安主義的工人階級團結的策略是不切實際的。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>區域革命戰略</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>制定更好的解放戰略的關鍵是將巴勒斯坦置於區域背景下。由於數以百萬計的巴勒斯坦難民融入中東，並且在一定程度上融入北非，他們的民族和階級鬥爭自然與該地區大眾的鬥爭緊密相連。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>這些工人和農民銘記着他們的先輩反抗殖民主義的鬥爭，面對支持壓迫他們的政權的帝國主義勢力，與巴勒斯坦人的鬥爭產生共鳴，因此他們將自己爭取民主和平等的戰鬥視為與巴勒斯坦的勝利緊密相連。這就是鬥爭之間相互影響、相互作用的原因；當巴勒斯坦人奮戰時，它激發了整個地區的解放運動，而這些地區的運動又反哺於被佔領的巴勒斯坦的鬥爭。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>他們的聯合起義有力量轉變整個地區，推翻政權，驅逐帝國主義列強，結束這些力量對以色列國的支持，在這個過程中削弱以色列，並向以色列工人證明地區性轉型能終結他們的被剝削狀態。極右翼部長阿維格多·利伯曼（Avigdor Lieberman）承認，2011 年的阿拉伯之春給以色列帶來的危險，在他看來，推翻了胡斯尼·穆巴拉克併為民主敞開大門的埃及革命，比伊朗對以色列構成了更大的威脅。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>這一區域戰略的力量和潛力已一再得到證明。在 1960 年代和 1970 年代，巴勒斯坦運動刺激了整個地區的階級鬥爭。2000 年，第二次起義開啓了抵抗運動的新時代，激發了一波組織浪潮，最終在 2011 年爆發了從突尼斯到埃及再到敍利亞的革命。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2019 年夏季，黎巴嫩的巴勒斯坦人在難民營組織了持續數週的大規模示威，抗議勞工部將他們當作外國人的決定，這一舉措在他們看來是形式上的歧視和種族主義。他們的抵抗激發了 2019 年 10 月更廣泛的黎巴嫩起義，這反過來又導致了伊拉克的民眾起義。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>鬥爭之間有一種辯證關係;當巴勒斯坦人戰鬥時，它觸發了區域解放運動，而區域運動又反饋到被佔領的巴勒斯坦運動中。他們的聯合起義有能力改變整個地區......</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>為了實行基於這種區域團結的戰略，巴勒斯坦團體和運動必須放棄由巴勒斯坦權力機構、哈馬斯以及大多數左翼所接受的不干涉該地區國家事務的政策。這種不幹預是獲得各種政權援助的先決條件。接受這一政策意味着切斷巴勒斯坦人與可以幫助他們贏得解放的社會力量的聯繫。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>相反，巴勒斯坦的鬥爭需要重新採納左翼分子在 1960 年代追求的那種區域性革命戰略。不幸的是，多數人放棄了這一戰略，轉而盲目追隨巴解組織與該地區的反動國家結盟。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>基於基層階級鬥爭的區域革命戰略，是從以色列到沙特阿拉伯、敍利亞乃至他們的帝國主義支持國，從美國到中國和俄羅斯的解放之路的唯一途徑。在這場鬥爭中，巴勒斯坦人和其他國家的人們必須支持所有遭受民族壓迫的羣體的訴求，像庫爾德人一樣，以及那些遭受種族、宗派和社會其他形式壓迫的人們。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>現在是恢復區域戰略的時候了。整個中東和北非都處於一個長期的革命進程中，這個進程根源於羣眾被挫敗的政治和經濟抱負。已經發生了兩波起義，第一次是在 2011 年，震撼了整個地區，第二次是在 2018 年和 2019 年，席捲了蘇丹、黎巴嫩、阿爾及利亞和伊拉克。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>由於民眾的訴求未得到滿足，第三波起義無疑正在醞釀之中。巴勒斯坦能夠並且必須站在這一輪解放自己以及整個地區鬥爭的前沿中心。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>革命進程中的巴勒斯坦</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>只有通過這一區域革命戰略，我們才能設想在歷史悠久的巴勒斯坦建立一個民主、社會主義和世俗的國家，在整個中東和北非的社會主義聯邦中，巴勒斯坦人和猶太人享有平等的權利。在新的巴勒斯坦國家裏，所有巴勒斯坦人將有權回到他們在 1948 年、1967 年及以後被迫離開的土地和家園。除此之外，巴勒斯坦的解放還必須包含一個全球性的經濟發展與重建項目，以確保巴勒斯坦人民的社會與經濟權利得到保障。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>為了實施這一戰略，巴勒斯坦人必須鑄造一個新的政治領導層，致力於在歷史悠久的巴勒斯坦及該區域內部自下而上地自我組織。他們不能孤立行動，而必須通過與埃及、黎巴嫩、敍利亞、伊朗、土耳其、阿爾及利亞以及其他所有國家的社會主義者的合作來完成這一目標。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>對於地區之外的人來説，最重要的任務是爭取左翼、工會、進步組織和運動支持對以色列的抵制、撤資和制裁運動。在帝國主義列強尤其是美國的機構和企業中強制執行這一運動，將有助於阻斷它們對以色列和其他專制政權的支持，削弱它們在該地區的影響力。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>因此，巴勒斯坦的解放必須經過解放生活在大馬士革、利雅得、多哈、德黑蘭、安卡拉、阿布扎比、開羅、安曼以及其他所有暴君統治下的人民。正如一位敍利亞革命者在 2014 年夏天從以色列佔領的敍利亞戈蘭高地所寫：「自由——是加沙、亞爾穆克和戈蘭的共同命運。這一口號寄託了對區域革命性轉變的希望，這是實現解放的唯一現實戰略。</p><hr><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

                <![CDATA[<p>從黃山回來的第二天，我從京東買了兩台筆記本電腦，一台紅米 Book14，一台 HP 稅 Pro14。這兩台裏的其中一台，是註定要被退貨的，下單兩個，只是為了不要跑電腦城，在家裏就能比較。懷疑這樣做有點剝削快遞小哥，以及那些裝箱打包做了無用功的人。但，是的，對不起。</p><p>許久沒當揹包客了，能記得的，還是在 2018 年。那年春節後和朋友們一道去北海，下飛機看他們一水行李箱，只有我背個雙肩包，打趣説你們好像女明星，我像助理。</p><p>自那以後，我也拖行李箱了，再沒背過包。行李箱在平整的地面上佔盡優勢，幾乎沒有軟肋。唯一的問題是噪音。有時凌晨出發，或者深夜到達，行李箱的滾輪滾過地面，轟隆隆雷鳴一樣，讓人有點尷尬。尷尬啥呢？當然是怕攪擾別人的好夢。這點上，我覺得我像日本人，願意守文明社會的規矩，需要和人保持距離，生怕打擾到別人……</p><p>這次黃山行，因為計劃中要去的地方比較多，黃山、宏村、西遞等，都不大適合拖箱子，而又有些懷念起以前揹包走天下的那種自由的感覺，正好有天晚上和朋友們吃完飯逛迪卡儂，揹包順手就買了。40L，只要不露營，足夠了。最重要，這包還可以裝電腦。</p><p>最近幾年常拖箱子出門，也是因為每次出門總要帶電腦，指不定就有工作的事情找上門來。有些時候運氣好，帶了不一定用得上。但不帶不行，出不了門。別看我好像整天到處跑，自由地了不得，事實上，牽着你的東西很多。爬黃山那天，老闆上午安排工作時，我還在索道門口排長隊。給他説我堵在黃山，晚上才能做。他回我，好。但我想，大概肚子在冒煙，不好發作。他對我的不好發作，和我對他不好拒絕一樣。於是粘粘糊糊，夾纏不清。晚上六點多才到酒店，吃完飯七點多，精疲力盡雙腿打顫，還不得不加班搞事。</p><p>話説那晚住的全季，可能是旅遊區，多少有點應付遊客，大牀房的牀是兩張單人牀拼成的。目測是兩張 1.5 米的單人牀，拼後變成 3 米，能睡四五個人。真浪費，我發了個動態説。有人評論説那被套可不好套。可不是？他們不好套，我也不好蓋，晚上想要卷一下被子，只能朝一邊，另外一邊，卷不到頭。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/23c35cbb-86cc-4095-88cd-091a3fffa24e.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>第二天逛宏村時，甚至兩次停下腳步在咖啡館弄臨時找上來的工作。花的時間倒不多，但影響心情，進而影響節奏。加上體力被前兩天的高強度運動耗得七七八八，揹包沉重，使得我心心念念很多年的宏村之行，草草收場。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b67f9de9-5792-4fb9-bae8-385186b2339b.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>宏村的湖邊、街巷，到處都是寫生的學生，吃飯的時候，這些畫夾前就空了，只留下畫板。</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/e00c5056-52da-40c6-bf59-8c6743999139.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>宏村</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/40f4c839-3545-4079-98b3-2ec65ab42e8a.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>宏村</figcaption></figure><p>相對來講，不怎麼出名的呈坎，要比名聲在外的宏村感覺好一些。我在呈坎住了一夜，行李放在客棧，不用揹着。呈坎人少，不像宏村那樣擾攘。下午在客棧的天台讀書，除了客棧的工作人員偶爾上來曬牀單，沒有其它人打擾。傍晚時，村外的山邊，炊煙四起。有一個山頭，完全籠罩在煙霧裏，像是起了火。讓我想起小時候，母親傍晚燒炕，遇連日陰雨，柴火被水浸濕，不容易點着，漚成的濃煙，籠滿整個窯洞。得把門簾在門扇上搭起來，也得半天方散。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/53e41191-6f04-4bf4-bcb8-45ec7b02faf0.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>呈坎</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ddeda8a1-d5f8-4968-b955-d02775ab89f4.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>呈坎的天台讀一本有關紅樓夢的書，從二手書店淘來的，很有歷史特色的語言，辛酸又好笑</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/60fa651a-6abb-4362-bc5e-418cddfb6f8c.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>傍晚時的炊煙</figcaption></figure><p>但呈坎的客棧是敗筆，去哪兒上評價很好，住進去才發現，窗子外面在蓋房子，白天吵吵鬧鬧，睡不着覺。晚上倒是安靜，八九點時，遠處有人放煙花，正好綻放在在建樓房的窗洞裏。那晚看 WTA 珠海小年終的比賽，又寫日記，很晚才睡，關燈時發現牀頂有個壁燈關不掉。太晚不好找店家來，只好囫圇睡了幾個小時，一大早起牀走了，連客棧的免費早餐也沒吃。</p><p>呈坎有個特點，是我在其它地方沒見過的。那就是很多村民攔路拉客，要給你當導遊，都是大媽，頭髮花白，聲音洪亮，遠遠就衝着你喊：我給你講解？只要二十塊錢，裏面很大，迷宮一樣，你自己要迷路，還看不懂，噯噯，這邊，那邊是民房，沒有景點，噯，你看嘛，説你要迷路……有兩次，有人追在身後，夾纏不清，差點發火，才悻悻而去。</p><p>是很久沒揹包肩背不太習慣了吧，這次到後來，像是孫悟空背的那個大石頭，覺得越來越重，遂下定決心換個輕點的電腦。舊電腦用了六年多，當時一心想要大屏，帶數字鍵盤。六年來用着還算順手，一夕之間，覺得非換不可，輕便就好，屏幕可以小，數字鍵盤也可以不要了。</p><p>在小米和 HP 之間遊移不定，看上小米小巧的電源，又不捨 HP 的體驗。糾結不下，把心一橫，都買，買來放一起比對，哪個更有眼緣就留下哪個。最終還是留下了 HP，也因為我發現，用小米的電源也可以給 HP 充電，那不就單獨買個電源的事？淘寶多的是替代產品。</p><p>於是就想啊，你 HP 既然能用小的電源適配器，那原裝電源又何苦還做得那麼粗笨？把這問題拋給朋友，他説那些外國品牌一貫傲慢的嘛，又不像國產品牌這麼會做表面文章討好大多數。</p><p>我想，也許也還有個慣性或者惰性的問題。像是舒適圈，有時明知道往外跨一步更好，但圈裏待著舒服啊。直到某天，外力逼迫，不得不改。</p><p><br class="smart"></p>

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>圖片：歪腦設計組</figcaption></figure><p>經濟前景暗淡的年代，中國居高不下的考公考編熱已成為時代景觀。年輕人扎堆去卷體制內工作的原因眾所周知——面對競爭激烈、收入縮水、工作難找、社會保障差的現實，只有體制才能提供一個安穩、可預期的「庇護所」。然而，如果這「庇護所」本身就是促成經濟問題的因素，又怎麼指望其中的人可以獨善其身呢？</p><h2>龐大編制帶來的沉重負擔</h2><p>最近，公務員、事業編制「縮編」的<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://news.ifeng.com/c/8SzJP3XFHyh">新聞</a></strong>引起了廣泛關注，也給想要趕上這股潮流的人亮起了紅燈。中國廣泛存在行政機構和事業單位編制沉冗、財政供養人員過剩的問題。為支付超比例的政府僱員的工資，地方政府常常面臨入不敷出的壓力，「借錢」發工資的消息屢見不鮮。沉重的供養負擔使得本來就債務高企的地方財政雪上加霜，無以為繼。近幾年，國家為了消化地方債務，正在推動一系列財政重整措施，其中一項要求就是機關事業單位「縮編」。</p><p>專家認為，中央對地方債務的介入有助於推動解決頑固的編制沉冗問題，卻未必能夠為年輕人的考公考編熱降溫。因為縮編只是意味着「鐵飯碗」不再牢固，卻「並沒有從根本上改變體制內工作相對於體制外工作的優越性。」另外，由於大量的擴招，很多年輕人上的大學、學的專業質量堪憂，畢業後在社會上很難有就業機會。</p><p>「如果這些大學生在個人層面，在上大學期間一直沒有發現自己的興趣和天分，也未能掌握實用的技能或獲得一定經驗，或者一句話，還沒有找到適合自己做的事情，那麼説實在的，用足作為一名應屆畢業生的優惠條件去爭取考編「上岸」，在目前的經濟和就業形勢下仍然不失為一個合理的選擇，因為機會成本本來就不是太大。」</p><p>個體在有限條件下的選擇固然無可厚非。然而我們不禁要問，中國的「體制」為何成為了這樣的怪物？它圈養着太多沒有目標，只求安全的年輕人，不斷再生產着他們的無能，荒廢着他們的生命，最終自己也膨脹成一個危害全社會健康的腫瘤。無論對於國家還是對於個人來説，體制的建構（以及參與其建構）都是一個作繭自縛的故事。要從這厚重的繭房裏破繭而出，不經歷脫胎換骨之痛，恐怕難以獲得新生。</p><h2>體制：當代中國的初始設定</h2><p>我身邊一些自由主義朋友有種很天真的想法，覺得隨着國內經濟越來越差，社會矛盾凸顯，蔓延至身邊的災難變多，現在仍認同體制的人會「被教做人」，他們會被激起反抗，或者至少，有所醒悟。</p><p>現實正好相反。在中國的語境下，環境越差，權力對資源的壟斷和分配能力就越佔主導，個體的自主空間就越小。對於大多數普通人來説，就越需要依附權力去獲取必要的保障。而這種「自主空間」並不僅僅是指物質生活空間，精神空間也會縮小。也就是説，恐怕人們不僅不會「醒悟」，反而會更加認同體制。</p><p>疫情後的考公考編熱多少已能佐證這一點。在筆者小時候，改革開放重啓後的 90 年代，經濟的蓬勃發展隨着「解放思想」的號召，「下海」才成為全民熱潮。</p><p>當然，不必嘲笑這些自由主義朋友，這些黃金時代的遺孤。他們之所以這麼想，是因為他們還保有自由的心智。他們總是相信人的能動性——如果遭到壓迫，便要去衝撞桎梏，怎麼能逆來順受？所以他們是有能力脫離這片土地的人，不管是在精神還是肉身上。</p><p>人們常常把體制形容成「圍城」，而體制所製造的「圍城」是權力壟斷資源的結果。</p><p>「改革開放前，中國還在計劃經濟的時期，中國人都屬於特定的單位，並且專屬於特定的單位，個人既沒有實際的政治權利，也沒有獨立的經濟信用，就連消費也只能按照票證規定的數量和品種購買和分配。那種因為具有多樣、不確定和靈活的屬性而可以稱為「社會」的空間微乎其微。」北京大學教授高丙中教授<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.chinanews.com.cn/gn/news/2009/01-19/1532791.shtml">如是説</a></strong>，他所在的公民社會研究中心在 2009 年發佈了《中國公民社會發展藍皮書》。當時參與其編纂的 20 多位學者一致認為，中國已經邁進公民社會。</p><p>現在的年輕人理所當然把改革開放當成中國的「初始設定」，但實際上，體制才是當代中國的初始設定。改革開放後，體制之外出現了市場；隨着市場經濟的興起，人們擁有了私人領域；而私人領域孕育了人的獨立自主意識；自由人通過自由的聯合組成「公民社會」——這些才是新進概念。</p><p>而這些新進概念已然「過時」。當國家力量無度擴張，資源分配過多地受到行政力量的影響，那麼國家自然會成為最大的剝削者，擠壓市場和私人領域的利益，並試圖控制社會和個人的方方面面。老百姓只有成為它的一份子，才有渠道分得一杯羹。體制要維持這種特權，自然需要推高其進入門檻，於是，國家每年都製造出千軍萬馬過獨木橋的奇觀，從中遴選出一整個「特權階級」。</p><p>當然，體制並不是中國特產，美國和其他資本主義國家同樣也有「體制」——政府的行政機構和公共服務機構，大學、軍隊等系統也相對獨立於市場和社會。它們依靠公共財政維持運作，很少受到市場的幹預，資源也很少與社會流通。但區別是，這些體制背後的國家力量並不壟斷社會資源，體制內的工作也不存在那麼強的權力光環。所以體制對人們的吸引力有限，進入的門檻也並不高。畢竟在公權力之外，還有同樣壯大的資本市場和公民社會，它們呈現三足鼎立的狀態，便得以互相制衡和監督。一個離開了大學或軍隊的美國人同樣面臨重新適應社會的落差，但不至於在體制之外就沒有足夠的資源和空間去生存、發展。</p><p>近些年，將自己的痛苦境遇歸因於「萬惡資本家」的年輕人，或許不能算錯。畢竟國家控制的資本也算是資本，黨的權貴階層也會是掌握國家經濟命脈的資本家。不是説民營企業家就不會「作惡」，而是應該質問為什麼這個國家的法律、勞工權利與社會保障體系無力應對資本帶來的問題，而誰又是能夠免於監督的？另外，很多極左或極右的人都缺乏一種分析「語境」的智慧——事物的性質要看其關係、看其比例。權力的問題往往不在於自身的好壞，而在於互相的平衡和制衡。當國家機器的權力過大，資本必然與其苟合，孱弱的民眾只能淪為二者收割的韭菜。</p><p>對於曾經改革開放盛期的中國來説，去區分體制內外是有意義的，但一個極權化的國家其實不存在體制外的空間。不是政府機構、事業單位、國企才叫體制，如今的中國就是個以國家為單位的巨大「體制」。因為整個社會已經被國家機器牢牢困住，越發沒有自主的空間——獨立 NGO、獨立新聞媒體、民間組織、集會等都難以生存，甚至每個人都難以捍衞自己的私人領域和身心自主界限。</p><p>當這個體制承諾為社會提供依靠和庇護的時候，我們應該看到，正是這個體制給社會造成了困境，也正是它與資本主義的暗面同流合污。</p><h2><strong>所謂的「上岸」其實會把人溺死</strong></h2><p>普通人在這樣的社會裏很難找到出路。人們總把考進體制稱為「上岸」，彷彿暗示了一勞永逸的解脫和「從此以後」的幸福生活。然而，體制內卻又是另一場無望的煎熬，抱怨體制內的工作令人壓抑和麻木、令人感覺「浪費生命」的聲音同樣尖鋭。</p><p>縱觀那些從體制辭職之人的自述，他們最常提到的問題包括：行政化、政治化、官僚化過於嚴重，和專業無關的事務太多；人變成了螺絲釘，唯領導是從，無法發揮自己的特長和能力；按部就班，千篇一律的工作，找不到成就感和意義；低效、平庸的氛圍，做多做少都一樣，沒有發展空間；在體制裏也並不輕鬆，做事不自由又無法掌控自己的時間……</p><p>體制內的人需要承受體制的問題，特別是當體制和人——和人的性格、理智、價值觀、道德直覺等特質相矛盾的時候，尤其令人痛苦。</p><p>一位曾經在上海某大學當老師的作者喬葭蘭記錄了他教書十年後的<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/676260.html">辭職經歷</a></strong>，這篇文章火爆全網卻又被很快封殺。作者稱其教學和學術自由受到了太多政治幹預，學生也因為大環境的影響而變得急功近利、無法容忍異議。好不容易遇到個別熱情求知的學生來面試，卻被學校領導歧視、拒之門外。</p><p>「近年高校思想控制更深入，每門課大綱和教案重改，必須加入三個以上思政知識點，讓人反感，後來發展到為節課都要有思政內容，‘課程思政’由前幾年的個別老師申請項目拿經費，發展到百分之百覆蓋，每位老師都要把自己的課跟思政聯結。</p><p>去年有一次課間，突然後門進來一位教務督導老師落座來巡查聽課，課下走到講台與我交談，問怎麼沒聽到思想政治的內容，我糊弄説您來前剛剛講過，當時我班上的前幾排學生馬上應和，幫我糊弄搭腔，心照不宣，相視而笑。」</p><p>我對他的經歷很有共鳴。因為我曾經也在家鄉當大學老師，教建築設計，後來下定決心辭職出國讀書，從此一去不回頭。當時學校的政治化並未那麼嚴重，但行政凌駕於教學乃是常態。</p><p>我剛開始上課的時候對教學抱有極大熱情，因為發現班上的學生普遍基礎不好，我和另一個搭課的老師就利用課餘時間，費盡心思為他們制定補充教學和練習內容，學生的反響非常好，一些有天賦的孩子進步神速。但是沒過多久，我們就因為教授「超出課程大綱」的內容而被另一個班的學生和老師舉報到學校，課程被叫停，我們甚至被調查和約談。</p><p>後來，我發現老師連一些基本的自主權都被幹涉，比如説給不合格的學生掛科，副院長會打電話來勸：「不要掛太多，分數要給高一點，否則學生成績不好看，也影響我們系將來過評估。」末了還加上一句：「這也是為了保護你們老師。」有時就連一個普通輔導員，都可以打電話來要求給關係好的學生改分。而那些懂得配合領導的議程，卻不管學生的老師，獲得了最多的賞識。</p><p>但平心而論，比起高校穩定、悠閒的工作氛圍，這些小煩惱都不算什麼，我很快就習慣了得過且過，也變成了一個會划水、敷衍了事的人。等我回過神來的時候，我已經深陷進怠惰的泥沼裏無法自拔。我年紀輕輕就停止了成長，感受不到工作的意義，也不知道自己為什麼活着。我陷入了一種慢性的抑鬱狀態中，日復一日，對未來感到絕望。</p><p>讓我最困惑的就是，為什麼我明明過得非常痛苦，周圍的人卻還都説好，羨慕我擁有編制和全民默認的「女性最佳職業」，父母也為我的「完美到站」而心滿意足。一開始，我也告誡自己不要「身在福中不知福」。後來，我懷疑這就是一個巨大的謊言——這就是中國中產們從小為孩子所構建的「幸福生活」？簡直可笑。</p><p>我嘗試了各種「自救」，讀書、健身、寫作、養貓養狗、揹包旅行……但這些活動都未能安撫我的焦慮、將我重新激活。我覺悟到，如果我還想繼續停留在安全區裏，不願承擔任何風險，只敢通過消費去獲取消遣，所謂的「自我提升」就是自欺欺人而已。</p><p>現在我明白了，真正促使我離開的是一種存在主義危機。我看過一些人在四十、五十歲的年齡從體制裏出走，他們突然推翻了之前的人生，徹底改變軌道。這個「體制」不僅僅是指公職，而是他們一直以來的主流式生活。他們辭職、離婚、移民、重新求學……決定去做自己一直以來渴望的事。因為在生命走向衰老甚至死亡的時候，人總會升起一種緊迫的衝動——他們想真實地活着，他們想去真實的世界，因為他們想去尋找、實踐真實的自我。</p><p>只是，當人生已過去大半，出走的成本也變得過大。我很幸運，在三十出頭的時候感受到了這種衝動，並選擇相信自己的感受。我聽不進所有人的規勸，甚至和爸媽大吵一架，也非離開不可。在別人看來這只是任性，但對於我來説，這是生死攸關的決定。</p><h2>家庭往往就是體制的前線</h2><p>七年的時間一晃而過，離開時的心情仍記憶猶新。如今我已習慣了加拿大的生活，交到一些如家人般的朋友，做着自己熱愛的工作。這只是普普通通的人生，再也比不上我曾在國內擁有過的一切，但卻是我拼盡全力獲得的。</p><p>在這段旅程中，我曾經意氣風發，而後顛沛流離，也有過跌入谷底的時期，歷經打擊之後再也不復年少輕狂。但回過頭看，它堪稱一段非凡的英雄之旅，我遇到的人、經歷的事和他們帶給我的啓發，都是曾經身在體制裏的自己無法想象的。這一切都讓我認識了我，並最終成為了我。我生命中珍貴的東西，也在這個過程裏水落石出。</p><p>正因為親自走過了一遭，我更明白要成功脫離體制，以及脫離被體制化的生活是多麼困難。要應對自由所伴隨的巨大不確定性，除了自身不懈的掙扎，還有賴於很多「特權」和運氣。我的父母雖然一開始不同意我的選擇，後續卻給了我毫無保留的支持，在我每次失敗的時候，他們都沒有藉機奚落，也從不舊事重提，只是鼓勵我重振旗鼓，去做下一次嘗試。但我也不會忘記，是我的「固執己見」重啓了人生，我為我當初沒有交出自己而驕傲。當我上路的時候，他們因着對我的愛，也不得不隨着我學習、成長、調整心態和眼界，然後才漸漸和我走到了一起。</p><p>如前所説，中國是一個巨大的體制，這片土地上世世代代的「老中」，遠在我們想要考公考編之前，遠在我們進入社會之前，我們就已經在被體制規訓。國家與家庭的一以貫之，意味着家庭往往就是規訓的前線。如果父母對體制缺乏反思，那麼這些規訓都將以親緣為渠道，以愛為名行之，其效果也超過國家機器。</p><p>説到家庭的規訓，王路的文章<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.douban.com/note/850727749/">《也值一個屁》</a></strong>令我印象深刻，他講了自己熱愛體育的外甥被迫去考大學，結果考砸的故事。由此指出，中國父母總是傳遞給孩子一種「輸不起」的觀念，於是孩子的失敗都只能用來證明父母的正確、樹立父母的權威。</p><p>「這是親情的脅迫。哪怕是以最不動聲色的方式。我見過太多像外甥這樣的小孩，如果要學體育、藝術，或者什麼，家長會是這樣的態度：你非要學，我們也不攔着，家裏就是再困難，也要供你，但是有一點，你得好好學，給家裏爭氣。既然給了你機會，你又學不好，以後就啥也別説了。家裏安排你幹什麼，你就幹什麼。」</p><p>「‘輸不起’的觀念就會從小學，到初中，到高中，一點一點浸透到孩子的少年和整個青春期。越是聽話的孩子，越難以承受這種道德和親情的雙重壓力。把老老實實按部就班按照家長和老師的安排走下來的人，變成一個充滿內疚和負罪感的人。」——當權者剝奪了你自主的信心和對自我的信任，你才會心甘情願把自己的主導權交給他，讓他代替你做判斷，因為你相信他比你更清楚，什麼對於你來説是好的。</p><p>不容忍犯錯是一種極權控制。事實上，人人都在犯錯，並通過犯錯學習，犯錯正是一個人校準方向、去偽存真的途徑。當社會的容錯率太低，個體的試錯成本太高，太多人對「走彎路」唯恐避之不及。結果半生過去，連自己要什麼不要什麼都不知道，恰恰走入了人生最大的歧路。</p><h2><strong>你真的脫離了體制嗎？</strong></h2><p>最近給我最大震撼的是三明治的一篇非虛構故事<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24252514">《後悔從體制內辭職，38 歲的我重新準備考回去》</a></strong>，作者元琪是一個在社區做社工的女性，她由於受不了領導的壓榨和無望的發展前景，38 歲時從體制辭職。但在遭遇殘酷的社會現實後，她後悔到陷入了抑鬱，拼命想再考回體制。</p><p>閲讀作者反覆的精神自戕，以及對「體制」近乎魔怔的執念，都令人無比窒息。在另一篇<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_21147113">文章</a></strong>裏，她曾經清晰記錄了自己辭職的來龍去脈——領導的施壓已經威脅到了她的身體和心理健康，而這只是壓垮她的最後一根稻草。在這之前的十多年裏，她早就已經厭倦了這份工作，想要尋求事業上更多可能性。因此，離開體制並不是她頭腦發熱的決定，而是經過了長期的醞釀。</p><p>然而辭職之後，她偶然得知「社工大幅漲了工資」，加上找工作遇挫，內心陡然失衡。她像是完全忘記了自己之前的感受和渴望，徹底推翻了之前的想法，陷入極端的自責和自我否定中，甚至開始抱怨起父母沒有及早制止她。</p><p>「我覺得自己是一個因為不知道遊戲規則而提前退場的白癡，我甚至開始恨父母為什麼沒有在我一開始進入這個單位就告訴我‘進去雖然賺的少，但還會漲，而且能做到退休；可千萬不能在快 40 的時候失業，那樣就變成 40、50 失業人員了。’他們只是説‘你就在這裏待着吧’而已，我哪知道待多久？怎麼待？為什麼待？」</p><p>這着實令人驚訝，一個 38 歲的人不知道真實的社會是怎樣的？且仍然依賴父母來為她的人生負責？但轉念一想又無從苛責，畢竟她如此崩潰，也是因為在求職時遭遇的年齡歧視、性別歧視和惡性競爭，這畸形的職場環境對個體的壓迫不應被正常化。</p><p>作者坦誠地暴露自己的脆弱，需要莫大的勇氣，也得以讓更多人洞悉到老中式的宿命悲劇是怎麼形成的——關於這個體制以如何的獎懲機制在規訓人，以及更重要的，為什麼人們完全失去了超越體制的能力。</p><p>這個從「體制」裏出走的人，其實沒能逃出體制。如果説在體制裏的她還保有身心的真實感受、對體制的反思和抵抗它的能動性的話，通過對自己的全盤否定，和對體制發自內心的重新體認，她已被體制毀滅了。</p><p>「我愛老大哥。」——在《1984》的最後，奧威爾早就已經揭示過這種毀滅。</p><p>文章最後，元琪寫到：「我還特別質疑‘人生是曠野，不是軌道’這句話，它是社交網絡上流行起來的一句話，大概也只適用於利用互聯網做自媒體的人們吧？——我這樣想。因為血淋淋的殘酷現實中沒有給人生提供成為曠野的充足的客觀條件啊！」</p><p>體制的可怕之處，在於閹割人的自我，剝奪人的能力，使其陷入一種無能狀態。可怕的不是離開了它你就沒有保障，而是它已潛移默化塑造了你單薄的價值觀，狹隘的視野，對人生、對世界極為貧瘠的想象力，並灌輸給你超額的貪婪和恐懼。被它規訓後的人難以再去為自己掌舵，也只認得出、只會去追求那些他們通過體制所理解的、熟悉的價值。</p><p>在體制內的時候，因為領導的刁難和工作的壓力而想放棄，辭職之後被現實當頭一棒，又日思夜想體制內的好——一個人並不會因為離開了體制就自動獲得成長，她仍然和在體制內時一樣，最多懂得怎麼趨利避害，卻尚未擁有足以掌控自己命運的自由意志。</p><p>當體制的泡泡被打破，遭遇幻滅和創傷是多麼正常，但沒有能力的人會拼命想回到過去的幻象裏，有能力的人則會迅速調整自己的認知去面對現實。相信她很快會意識到，危機的另一面其實是機會，迴歸真相的機會。抓住這個機會咬牙走下去，説不定也能劫後餘生，逐漸開闢出新的道路，不斷獲得更多新知與能力，最終超越體制。</p><p>人生的價值並不憑空存在於體制外，也不憑空存在於任何地方，它們都需要通過十二萬分的努力，甚至賭上高昂的代價，在實踐中創造。正如一個讀者在元琪的文章後留言：「‘人生是曠野，不是軌道’只適用於那些決心克服千難萬難和內心恐懼，把人生變成曠野的人，你覺得是它就是，你去探索它就廣闊。」</p><p>我相信社會那麼大，總不至於鐵板一塊，應該到處都有縫隙容留離經叛道之人。儘管在體制外生活的空間會隨着環境惡化而越發逼仄，它往往意味着匱乏、清貧、孤獨……但對於很多心如明鏡的人來説，選擇這樣的生活是一種道德義務——他們拒絕和體制同流合污。</p><p>最後，我想分享一篇喜歡的<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://m.douban.com/note/822603710/?dt_platform=wechat_friends&amp;dt_dapp=1?bid=JKADXTXHT9Q?bid=gR6F0pJcJcc?bid=gR6F0pJcJcc?bid=VCkvR3pjUYY?bid=GPbkjI9dbug">文章</a></strong>的結尾：「人生就像一場翻山越嶺的長途拉力賽，旅途那麼長，未知風險那麼多，起點高一點低一點，影響的不過是開始的階段。只要一直跑，到後來會發現那些生來就被賞賜的好處都是浮雲，最終還是得靠自己。靠自己的雙腳去跑，靠自己的毅力去支撐，還要靠自己強大的心肌去泵動血液。相比那些令人豔羨的資產和社會地位，你的家庭所給予的那些無形的東西更珍貴，比如父母的身傳言教，幫你塑造的健全身心，親情支持，以及從小教會你的獨立自強等等……」</p><p>當你走出了自己的路，再回過頭去看——離開體制，你確實失去了一些「好處」，但是當你的心智早已成長到了更高的境界，不再認同過去的價值，又為什麼會為此難過呢？</p><p></p><p></p><p><br

9 月，修完我的第三個碩士學位，人生進入了新階段，再次去成為一個新社會的移民。十年前，我在香港做過一次這件事，如今再做一遍。</p><p>過去一週，我重讀了過去一年主要發在豆瓣平台上的帖子。</p><p>其中有大約半年時間，我沒辦法在除微信朋友圈的任何國內平台上説話，所以那是空白的賽博簡中半年。空白本身也是一種賽博表達。我沒有説出的話，已被規模化的空白展示出來。</p><p>至於那些我能説出來的時刻，我在那些帖子裏，看到自己的努力撐住、和無可迴避的痛。</p><p>在這個公眾號停止更新的漫長週期裏，我的手機還時不時收到來自官方提醒，某某陳年舊文又沒了。</p><p>在翻閲還剩下的那些文章時，我多少有些汗顏曾經的那些少年意氣，但也能感到那種短暫的青春與美麗。我不會裝作我還能回到從前，因為這些年的辛苦、創痛和抗爭，在我身上有足夠深刻的烙印。也有沒變的。那是我性格里那些——暴烈的，飄忽的，傷心的，淡漠的，決絕的——的部分。</p><p>我會從去年 9 月，我剛到捷克的那個下午開始整理我的「近況」和「遠況」，做一個移民知識分子的社交文本細讀。更系統的寫作，我會寫在給三明治的專欄裏。</p><hr><p>2022.9.17</p><p>（剛到捷克，收拾一天，到下午）不知怎麼就睡着了，夢到一片虛無之境，突然聽到一個聲音念，「白雲千載空悠悠」，覺得這一句太美了，然後醒了過來。</p><p>2022.9.23 標記圖書★★★★☆ Lost in Translation: A Life in a New Language</p><p>自行翻譯的一段：</p><p>「只要我周圍的世界每次都是新的，它就沒有成為我的世界；我咬緊牙關生存，去抵禦每一次陌生事物的襲擊……只有在你可以理解的環境中，刺激才會轉化為經驗，行動才會擁有目的，一張臉龐才會顯得親近，一個人方能被認識。這些模式構成了意義的土壤。但這顯然是移民、流亡和’極端流動性’（Extreme mobility）的危險，因為你從那片意義的土壤中，被連根拔起。」</p><p>（我在給三明治的文章<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

《重訪東歐》</p><p>讀這本書的旅程，我和霍夫曼訪問波蘭的路徑幾乎一模一樣。但讓我自嘲一下就是，我一路上找普通人聊天，已經困難重重。霍夫曼迴歸波蘭後，全是談笑皆鴻儒。而我一直在刻入骨髓的孤獨中。</p><p>2023.4.13</p><p>（我的豆瓣賬號被封禁半年，微博被「無限期」封禁。過去半年後。）</p><p>180 天，我出來了。</p><p>2023.4.13</p><blockquote><p>「我們僥倖能活過集中營的這些人，其實並不是真正的見證人。這種感想，固然令人不甚自在，卻是在我讀了許多受難餘生者，包括我自己在內所寫的各種記載之後，才慢慢領悟。</p><p>多年以後，我曾重讀自己的手記，發現我們這一批殘有的生還者，不但人數極為稀少，而且根本屬於常態之外。也許是運氣，也許是技巧，靠着躲藏逃避，我們其實並未陷落地獄底層。那些真正掉入底層的人，那些親見蛇蠍惡魔之人，不是沒能生還，就是從此啞然無言。」</p></blockquote><p>——Primo Levi</p><p>2023.4.26</p><p>我貼了一張最後在深圳那段時間的段落：</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b9a256cd-8ac1-465d-be6d-ba3ca85aac07.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p></p><p>兩年後我回到德國哥廷根。我寫道：</p><p>在德國、波蘭、捷克繞了兩年，我現在回到德國，並且現在就在語言班。我和一個日本人、一個烏克蘭人、一個印度人、一個巴基斯坦人一起學德語，除了我，她們四位都是女性。日本人曾在東京做「會社員」，男朋友三年前來慕尼黑工作，現在到哥廷根讀書，我們週末在漢諾威的火車上偶遇了，男友長得像年輕小栗旬。她辭職，申請 Working holiday 來了這裏，開始學德語。我也不意外，日本護照是全世界最有特權的護照。</p><p>烏克蘭人是個數學家，戰前就來了哥廷根，在大學研究所工作，她説自己既要學英語，也要學德語。她知道所有名詞的前面該用 der，die 還是 das，這天賦讓人驚歎。我問她是否是因為烏克蘭語的名詞詞性和德語基本一致。她用口音鏗鏘婉轉的英語告訴我，我們烏克蘭語講起來根本不説這個。那我想這就是數學家善於歸類的純天賦了吧。</p><p>印度人來自孟買，她丈夫來自德里，在德國工作兩年了，她們在印度幾年前結了婚，現在她來了剛兩個月，她不是穆斯林，很世俗，騎個自行車迅即如飛，英語講得很好。現在她要做的是在德國找一份工作。哥廷根儘管是學術城市，但要找一份研究以外的職業，德語才是更重要的。</p><p>巴基斯坦女人比較有趣，她是穆斯林，Hijab 裹得很緊，第一天上課甚至是丈夫送來的。但她上課很積極，經常搶答，我們練習對話時，她反應也很快。在我們試着説我們所知的從 A 到 Z 的德語詞彙時，她知道一切關於超市、食物和日用品的單詞。在講到職業時，她説自己是 Hausfrau，這就難怪了。</p><p>我則多少有些不接地氣，講到職業，磕磕絆絆説出 Schriftsteller 這樣的詞彙。老師説，你能不能説一些正常的職業。而且你如果是記者和編輯，就不要説自己是作家，作家是寫書的。我用德語緩緩回覆説，我以前的職業是記者和編輯，現在我就是 Schriftsteller。</p><p>我們都在如幼童般學一門語言，但我們又都在各種場合自學過這門語言了，於是我們都掌握了龐大地圖中的小小一隅。而那一隅，多半都關乎我們已經走過的漫長歲月，我的詞彙庫裏是那些老師口裏不正常的職業和名詞，巴基斯坦女人的詞彙庫裏是超市裏所有的蔬菜、肉類、水果和洗衣粉。</p><p>我於是搜出這條兩年前的想象自己在語言班的內容。我現在沒有絲毫難民感——事實上，這兩年我交往了好些曾是難民（如今獲得公民權）的朋友，他們都太厲害，太激勵我了。</p><p>對了，當我在説她們英語好的時候，並不是説她們有一口倫敦腔/美國腔。我覺得我英語也不錯，但是我是一個非英文母語者在使用這門語言。這曾是一門殖民的語言，那既然如今，全世界都在使用它，那它就得有新的後殖民傳統。They write you, you write back.</p><p>2018 年時我在香港研究後殖民主義文學，過去兩年我在德國、波蘭和捷克都必修或旁聽了好些後殖民主義英語寫作課程，一口正宗 xx 腔，是最不重要的事情，我要做的事，就是 write back。</p><p>現在德語關乎我的生存，雖然很燒腦，但在波蘭學了一點波蘭語之後，我覺得德語至少看着很親切。</p><p>我想説做一個移民/難民，一定意味着你是一個樂觀主義者——這不是我説的，這是阿倫特説的。你有強大的自信，相信將自己連根拔起後，仍然能在俗世追求一場比你所擁有的，要更幸福的生活。我並非重新開始，而是一切我曾經的自我選擇，促成我更多的自我選擇。</p><p>我也不用去羨慕這條帖子裏的朋友了，因為顯然，我相信自己有更深思熟慮的強大生命力。</p><p>2023.4.29</p><p>明天就要去巴爾幹了，赴 2019 年説好的約。</p><p>2023.5.13</p><p>最近這幾個月很多事情糾纏在一起。</p><p>終於在我國大流行結束後去換了回鄉證，整整十年前去到的港村，算是徹底告一段落。</p><p>在德國，忍着極大的尷尬，使用谷歌實時翻譯，把完全聽不懂的 Erste Hilfe Kurs(first aid course) 上完了，7 個小時，拿到證書，因為這是拿德國駕照的必經之路。</p><p>每天的德語課程。聯繫柏林的房產中介。做田野，讀文獻，寫論文，完成我的第三個碩士學位（最初我覺得挺丟人的，現在覺得還挺吊的，因為每個學位都徹底改變了我的能力，和命運……）。還有關於出版的那些東西。還有之後在異國的居留權。</p><p>德國白人朋友説我這是 Shenzhen speed，因為他 2019 年和前女友一起去過一趟深圳，爬上了平安大廈頂層，感嘆這句 Time is money, efficiency is life 的口號既神奇又瘋狂。他讓我慢一點，要享受生活。但其實一方面，我覺得自己在這邊的移民朋友們，孟加拉人和印尼人，甚至比我更快，更不享受生活，這是沒有辦法的事情，對我們來説挺住就是一切。</p><p>其次就是我早就習慣了這種掙扎着追尋自由的生活，因為那足夠自我，足夠「海拉魯」，足夠改寫自己的命運。</p><p>2023.5.16</p><blockquote><p>「德國在 1934 年至 1938 年間出版了大量兒時回憶、以家庭為背景的小説、風景圖冊、大自然抒情作品，以及許多柔情萬種的小玩意兒。這是前所未見的現象。除了刻板的納粹宣傳文學之外，德國能夠獲準發行的書籍幾乎完全來自那些範疇。大約從兩年前開始，這個趨勢就已經不斷退潮。其中的原因顯然是，因為不管再怎麼挖空心思，也越來越無法營造出那種不痛不癢的氛圍。</p><p>不過，在此之前的狀況只能令人搖頭嘆息：所有的文學作品都在描繪雪片蓮和雛菊花、稚子放長假時的歡樂、初戀時光、童話情景、烤蘋果和聖誕樹。這種文學充滿了赤子之心和缺乏時代背景的色彩，彷彿有約在先一般，在遊行隊伍、集中營、軍火工廠和「衝鋒隊」募捐鐵罐的環繞之下紛紛出爐。</p><p>如果有誰曾經像本書作者一樣，於偶然之下必須大量閲讀此類書籍的話，便會逐漸發現，它們在乖巧、平靜和溫柔的敍述背後，正在字裏行間不斷髮出吶喊：「你難道沒注意到，我們不受時間影響，迴歸於內心世界了嗎？你難道沒注意到，並沒有任何事情對我們造成傷害嗎？你難道沒注意到，我們什麼事情都沒有注意到嗎？請記住這一點，請務必記住這一點，我們向你提出懇求！」</p><p>我認識那些作家當中的某些人。對他們每一個人，或至少大多數人而言，現在已經到了山窮水盡的地步。所發生的許多事件已經令他們無法再視而不見、聽而不聞。比方説，他們的親朋好友已經有人被逮捕，要不然就發生了類似的事件。童年時代的回憶已無法再提供保護傘。不少人因之而崩潰，演出了一幕又一幕的悲劇。將來我會找時間敍述其中的一些故事。</p><p>以上就是德國人在 1933 年夏天所面對的矛盾。那看起來就彷彿是，必須從幾種讓心靈死亡的不同方式之中作出選擇。我們可以説，於正常環境下過慣日子的人，在這裏會感覺自己若非進了瘋人院，就是待在一所精神病研究所裏面。可是又能怎麼辦呢？事情就是這個樣子，而且我無力迴天。此外，那個時候還算是比較無害的階段，接着還會出現完全不一樣的情況。</p><p>我想躲在私人領域裏面，在一個有遮蔽的小角落安身立命之嘗試，很快便一敗塗地。其中的原因是：這種地方根本就不存在。狂風暴雨從四面八方侵襲我「私底下」的生活，馬上把它吹得四分五裂。比方説，一個可稱得上是我「朋友圈子」的小團體，就在 1933 年秋天消失得不知去向。」</p></blockquote><p>——《哈夫納回憶錄：一個德國人的故事》。</p><p>2023.5.25</p><p>Moving to a new country and adapting to it can destroy relationships.</p><p>（這是我的俄羅斯學姐的畢業論文裏的一句話。在俄羅斯入侵烏克蘭後，她決定寫這個題目，前蘇聯移民女性在瑞典如何生存。她寫民族誌。這一句是她採訪的在瑞典的前蘇聯女性——一個非俄羅斯人用俄語的回憶。最初搬到瑞典來時，她們是夫妻兩個人，樹年後，她和丈夫離婚了。我的俄羅斯學姐問她為什麼，以上是她的回答，從俄語翻譯成英語。）</p><p>2023.6.7</p><p>油管最近不知為何開始給我推 432Hz 的純聲音，説會釋放潛意識的不良能量。有天夜裏我醒來，打開這個聲音，似音樂非音樂，然後香甜地接着入睡了。我只記得身處一片雲霧之中，有許多人來來去去，我開始不知為何感到委屈，感到悲傷，然後哭了起來，半夢半醒地哭，這場夢中的哭泣，就好像一片葉子，在水裏，不知道為什麼，盪來盪去。</p><p>2023.6.16</p><p>（我為畢業論文，在柏林做田野期間，順便去看了一些柏林的老房子，為未來搬過去做打算。）</p><p>在柏林 Neukölln ，帶着懂房地產的朋友，看了兩套房，算是練練手。看完有點鬱悶。她安慰説，第一次看房就買房，就跟和初戀結婚一樣不現實。我一下釋懷了。</p><p>2023.7.4 大概是十幾年前有一幫人做獨立校園媒體，畢業前引用了《一代宗師》裏那句「念念不忘，必有迴響」，覺得很酷，有種善惡終有報的爽感。然後去了香港，至此走上不歸路。做的大多數自認為有社會價值有意義的東西，不管是新聞報道、採訪研究還是社會抗爭，都沒有迴響，一絲一毫也沒有，然後一身折磨，滿心創傷，活在懲罰、監控和噩夢之中。</p><p>再在國門完全封閉的兩年多前到歐洲，感慨過去十來年，一遍又一遍地重新鍛造自己，又時常會想起二十來歲寫的看上去意氣風發的「人生是一場出埃及記」，但真的出埃及可沒有分開紅海的壯闊，也不會期待什麼迴響，習慣在全新的孤獨中去打造微小的共同體，一心只想去過那種權力不希望你過的生活。</p><p>上個月 Mubi 推薦的每日電影恰好是《一代宗師》，鬼使神差打開了。關在房間裏，拉上窗簾、打開投影，看了一個下午。才想起原來「念念不忘，必有迴響」前面還有八個字，那不太起眼、也不太被十幾年前的心緒記住的八個字。因為那八個字完全沒有目的，不求回報，不期待迴響：</p><p>憑一口氣，點一盞燈。</p><p>2023.7.30</p><p><strong>告一段落</strong></p><p>歐陸對碩士的學術要求還是很高的。</p><p>回憶起來，我剛到這個德國城市的那半年修了五門課，每門課的 term paper 都需要 15-20 頁，不包括 bibliography。波蘭和捷克的兩個學校要求比哥廷根要低一些，但低不了太多。這次的畢業論文 thesis 是 30000 個單詞。</p><p>我第一個碩士在港大新聞系，畢業是寫一篇 3000-5000 單詞的英文深度報道。第二個碩士在港大文學院讀英文研究（文學 track），畢業論文是寫一篇 5000 字左右的 capstone project（比較奇怪學院不説這是 thesis）。</p><p>當年讀的時候，兩個都很吃力，第一個是全職讀，第二個是邊打工邊讀。除了當時能力差勁以外，有個巨大的問題就是時間很短，沒法充分地浸潤其中。比如在新聞系，剛剛適應英文上課，就要開始找冬天的實習。在寫畢業報道的時候，還要想着如何留在香港找一份新聞的工作。所有的事情都發生在不到 12 個月裏。</p><p>文學繫好一些，課程設置非常非常先鋒，後殖民主義文學尤其好。但是因為香港高校效仿英國的教育產業，把 MA 和 Mphil 分開，所以 MA 仍然缺少足夠的時間去消化那些學到和讀到的東西。我當時一邊在廠裏打工，一邊打官司，一邊讀這個專業，很吃力。所以我把當時的所有資料打印出來，直接帶到了德國來，時不時複習一番。</p><p>歐陸這兩年的訓練和浸潤其中，是我體驗最好的一次，從理論、方法論到真正做田野、做研究，我都有足夠的時間和不同的導師、或不是導師的教授們，不斷地交流。</p><p>我自己覺得，一是我的英文能力、各方面的生存能力有了一個質變般地提升，這很大程度上得益於我的第二個碩士，作為一個移民，我提前接受了後殖民教育。</p><p>二是德國的政治經濟制度真的離香港那種極端的新自由主義制度比較遙遠。在這種地方，小城市尤其更便宜。我不會整天被鋪天蓋地的金融、財富、房租的壓力弄到去被迫學習那些新自由主義技能，比如在地鐵口和證券經紀人去開證券戶口這種很傻缺、但又很香港的真實故事。</p><p>我現在找到了我為何要讀三個碩士的理由：</p><p>第一個是因為我不想在國內做新聞記者。</p><p>第二個是因為想為潤提前做語言和思想的準備。</p><p>第三個是因為要執行離開，當然離開只是手段，我是為了恢復公共寫作。</p><p>現在執行完了。讀不讀博士，也許現在多了一點點信心，但是有什麼研究課題，得花五年時間去做的？得再想想。</p><p>生存和身份永遠是第一要義。簡單説，交稅是第一要義，有德國學位+兩年交稅，可以申請永居。</p><p>其次，即便是在德國，你還是生活在新自由主義的大環境中的移民。</p><p>前些天數了一下過去十年做的五份工作。兩份記者編輯 YZZK。DUAN。都在香港，自由媒體。一份風投機構 FENGRUIZIBEN。一份學術機構 GANGDAZHENGZHIXUEXI。一個廠工 GUANGDONGOUBOKEJI。我沒任何成為領導的職業規劃，唯一的規劃就是要自由地活。記者不讓做了，可以去為掙錢而吃屎一段時間。這都是計劃的一部分。</p><p>生活很簡單，明確目標，面對無處不在的突發情況，保持淡定，一步步執行，一步步潤。不和權力媾和與妥協。</p><p>2023.7.31 電影《晨光正好》★★★★☆</p><p>"I have forgotten how."真像我的異國生活。我突然意識到，移民生活至少在某些時空下，也是一種喪偶體驗。</p><p>2023.08.04</p><p>成為散居者/離散者/移民，成為一個國家的少數族裔，成為第一代移民，是否還使用母語寫作，如何使用第二或三門語言，如何準備好所有的資料去外國人辦公室，如何讓銀行卡里有官員們認可的金額，什麼情況可以辦公立醫療保險，什麼情況可以申請何種居留，你在何種程度介入母國政治和文化生活，你要如何努力不讓自己在接收國社會徹底缺席，你應該如何進行跨國的公共參與，你要如何面對一個自由民主體制的系統性不公，這些都是實實在在需要第一代移民去面對、行動甚至抗爭的……</p><p>如果我做移民生意，我會首先教中產白領多讀讀後殖民主義。後殖民主義在國內語境下，老被我國新左派奇形種們，拿來證明對抗西方的重要性，這當然是一種脫離語境的逆練。</p><p>但如果你是一箇中國的自由右派中產階級，如果對後殖民毫無瞭解，在移民後很容易陷入失語，因為作為移民你一定會遭遇一種系統性的歧視性環境，尤其拿着一本我國護照的時候。但你此刻陷入一種極端的交叉性之中，面對很多問題，脫離語境，你往往不知道怎麼描述自己的痛苦。一個簡單的問題是，一個自由民主社會怎麼還會有這麼多讓我不舒服的地方呢？我批評它難道不是跟小粉紅一樣了嗎？一定是我自己的問題吧。</p><p>不是的，是這個自由民主社會的問題。</p><p>2023.08.28 電影《過往人生》★★★★☆</p><p>移民的類型真多啊。而我呢？二十二歲時以為到香港，就到此為止。三十歲又來一次。在大流行大封鎖期間。訣別愛人，不斷地訣別愛人。不是同樣的人生境遇，沒有一起出走，被打斷的團聚，渴望，恨，痛，無可奈何，任它去罷。走到的竟然還不是英語國家。牙牙學語。我的夢裏不是中文，我的夢沒有聲音。對她説理解她的選擇。對她説我沒有回頭路。那等待我的命運是什麼呢？Nora 想拿的那些獎，我不想，我只好奇我能活到哪一歲。</p><p>2023.09.05</p><p>在德國的工作快有眉目了，不過話別説太死，任何事情都可能發生變故。看看去努力做連接者，會是什麼樣。我很珍惜這個機會，因為真的能幫到人。不坐班，但得住柏林。有時間寫我那本拖欠的稿，有時間上德語課，有時間自我尋找較長時間的項目，一個個默默做下去，找到一種可以不損害個人福祉、有未來可持續、而不是為愛發電、充滿日常威脅的生活和貢獻方式。這是我十年前，剛做港媒記者時，夢寐以求的一種生活模式。</p><p>過去十年，我在香港或深圳或北京，始終找不到這樣的模式。我很早就成為一個國家的邊緣人。但過去十年的五份工作和三個碩士，給了我一身新自由主義跨國技能，這是特權。我想許多人身上都有自己各自的 Privilege 和 Marginality，重要的是認識和理解到這些，知道自己的身體處於社會結構的哪個位置，然後去做一點有益的事情。當然，不要讓自己過得太辛苦，這同樣是過去十年的經歷教給我的。你得理解，無論在哪裏，你仍然活在一個新自由主義的世界。</p><p>自然少不了那無窮無盡的歧視性的許可文件之路。這條路我曾走過一次，走了七年。移民的世界充滿瞭如下詞彙：技能、語言、入境處、牆、種族、性別、階級、外國人管理局、勞動部、國籍法…這些詞彙把你<strong>鍛造成流亡高手、官方信件收發室、自我觀察大師、努力支楞職業演員、被迫多語言使用者。</strong>（粗體字抄襲了 Dubravka Ugresic 的小説《平衡的藝術》，出自《狐狸》一書）</p><p>2023.09.14</p><p>今年二月，時隔兩年回國，要辦因為封鎖而拖了好幾年的回鄉證，去老家縣派出所註銷戶口。那段時間死人比較多，家對面的縣人民醫院每天都死幾十個人。很多年輕人來派出所幫家裏其他亡故親人註銷戶口。</p><p>我沒多想，徑直問派出所裹着很厚深藍色棉襖的大姐：我來註銷我的戶口。</p><p>大姐看着我直勾勾地説：你的死亡證明在哪裏？</p><p>她説完我們互相盯着對方，竟然有幾秒鐘，她沒覺得尷尬，我沒覺得冒犯。我們只是沉默看着對方。此後我反覆想起那個沉默的悲傷情景，我不知道她是不是失去了誰，但她看向我如看穿一個莫名其妙的鬼魂。</p><p>她在那一刻只是個照章辦事的小吏嗎，還是她一瞬間妄想了和鬼魂説話的可能嗎？</p><p>2023.09.18</p><p>關於這天與去年，我記得許多許多的痛。</p><p>2023.10.11</p><p>夏天結束，人生悲傷事情真多。</p><p>2023.10.20</p><p>重新過上坐公共交通上下班的日子。但純粹就是坐地鐵，談不上擠地鐵。給外管局發去了我的工作合同。吃午飯時把她送的手套忘了，現在去找。再獨自去看《花月殺手》，遲到了二十分鐘，結果還在放廣告。</p><p>2023.10.23</p><p>今天去柏林出差，順便又看了一次房子，再次失望了。</p><p>位置特別好，Kreuzbergstraße，房子裝修得特別好，暖氣非常現代化，電錶是全新的，馬桶不是坐地的而是入牆的，看這些是上次看房學到的經驗，朝向雖然朝北但這不算啥了。之所以降價 20%，是因為之前樓上屬於一個房屋建造公司，疫情前在加蓋一層，然後疫情期間，房屋建造公司倒閉了，於是外立面和院子裏的腳手架，就這麼一直綁在外面。</p><p>整棟樓院就這麼像木乃伊一樣被綁了一年多了，新來的物業管理公司聯繫不到原來的房屋公司負責人，也不知道何時腳手架會解除。</p><p>對了，這棟公寓樓的建成日期是 1900 年。建造日期早不一定差，因為那時候建造的房子牆體厚，用料紮實，隔音好，保暖好。比起 1945 年以後那幾年修的房子反而更好。我住過 1955 年建造的房子，隔音等於沒有。</p><p>但是 1900 這個年份還是讓我太驚訝了，那是歐洲的大國協同的長和平時代，是兩次大戰以前的長 19 世紀，是民族獨立蠢蠢欲動的時代，是帝國殖民的晚期，是黑暗之心出版的第二年，是第二帝國，是晚清！我竟然在看一個這樣的房子，這裏面有多少孤魂野鬼住過？</p><p>回我的小城時，德鐵又「準時地」取消+alternative 的班次也「準時地」延誤了。</p><p>2023.10.30</p><p>讀 Ocean Vuong 的新小説，On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous.</p><p>這讓我想起一個 1.5 代華人移民 ABC 朋友，她一直在主流外媒工作。我和鄧飛打官司時，她曾採訪我。前段時間在瑞典的一個新聞 Fellowship 上，我們重逢了，聊了很多文學類的話題，不再是採訪者和受訪者的關係。她離開美國後，一直在亞洲各種地方生活，印度、中國、泰國等等。我們有一個非常相反的人生軌跡，連讀書都是。我是先讀 Rushdie，進入英文系後再讀 Jhumpa Lahiri。她則是相反。我喜歡她郵件發給我的一個她所寫的短篇隨筆。</p><p>我能理解到她使用英文為母語的優美和傷感，就好像看的這本書一樣。這本美好的傷感的書。我們在這片大地上，曾短暫地絢爛過。</p><p>（結束。我沒想到把所有這些很短的段落結合起來，竟然會有九千多個字。）</p><hr><blockquote><p>如果你讀到這裏，不妨下方鏈接，輸入郵箱，即可訂閲「Diasporic

            </title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>在廣州東北三百多里的深山中，藏着大宋朝的國家寶藏。</p><p>對大多數宋人來説，這是蠻荒莽林，但對王安石而言，卻是自幼熟悉之地。十歲那年，他父親來此做官，他也跟着待了三年，到老仍念念不忘。</p><p>這裏藏着很多野生銅礦。夜間路過的話，常常能發現山間高聳的巖壁上散射出金碧的光芒，地上也時不時能撿到摻雜着青色金屬的石塊。由於很多人來這裏偷偷挖礦冶煉，附近常常發生火災，境內的月華寺百年內燒燬了三次。</p><p>此地名為韶州，來這淘金的人，到北宋中期已經不下十萬。公元 1050 年，朝廷終於下令在這裏建設專門的鑄幣機構「永通監」，大規模鑄造銅錢。這裏的銅產量，巔峯的時候超過全國的 95%。</p><p>原本北宋一年歲鑄的銅錢量基本在 100 萬貫上下，但自從永通監設立之後，這個數值一路上漲，到王安石變法期間，僅該監一年就能鑄造銅錢 160 萬貫。</p><p>在上篇《賣炭翁》的故事裏曾經提到，唐帝國一輩子也沒跳出通貨緊縮，問題直到宋代才解決。</p><p>確實，宋代鑄造出了足夠多的銅錢。但新的問題又出現了。</p><hr><p>永通監設立的那一年，王安石三十歲，已經擁有了不小的名氣。他二十一歲中進士，按照老朋友曾鞏的説法，「自重，不願知於人」，很愛惜自己的羽毛，不願自我吹噓。即使有機會申請既有前途又清閒的官位，他也並不在意，一心要去地方上實踐自己的理念。</p><p>他越是不求名利，越是被大家看重。政敵兼朋友司馬光也不得不承認，安石「獨負天下大名三十餘年」，天下人都認為他只要去中樞做官，太平盛世就將來到。</p><p>歷史書上通常講王安石的變法，終極目的是富國強兵，但這其實是大大的誤會，實在把他看得小了。</p><p>他在三十八歲時給仁宗皇帝寫了一份《萬言書》，講他自己的改革主張。全篇基本沒提到強兵，提理財的也很少，按篇幅算只有 2.5%。剩下的部分全部是在講求「先王之政」。</p><p>在王安石看來，宋代的內憂外患，根子上是由於不行先王之政。而之所以如此，癥結在於沒有通曉先王之意的人才。所以為政之道，首先是要教育這樣的人才，培養他們的品德，然後把其中優秀的人選出來加以任用。</p><p>用現在的觀點看，王安石其實是想推行一套全新的國家意識形態。</p><p>漢唐的儒生講究「尋章摘句」，注重鑽研字詞的含義、禮法的細節。但是王安石認為這個方向完全錯了。完全的復古沒有前途，真正的改革要追尋先王的政治精神，而非沉迷於文字的細節。</p><p>要追尋先王的政治精神，就得先講明白這個精神是什麼。王安石寫了很多書來講這個，其中保留最完整、也最有代表性的，是一篇《洪範傳》。</p><p>《洪範》是儒家經典《尚書》中的一篇，字面意思是「大法」。這篇文章裏講了九種治國的根本大法，也即儒生們津津樂道的「洪範九疇」。王安石對這九種大法的解釋有詳有略，其中展開最詳的是第五種大法——「皇極」——也就是君王之道，相關內容佔據了全文四分之一的篇幅。</p><p>儘管身為臣子，但王安石對於應該怎麼做皇帝卻很有一套自己的見解。比如他認為皇帝不能從眾：</p><blockquote><p>「苟曰好德，則雖煢獨，必進寵之而不虐；苟曰不好德，則雖高明，必罪廢之而不畏也。……虐煢獨而寬朋黨之多，畏高明而忽卑晦之賤，最人君之大戒也。」（翻譯見註釋，下同）</p></blockquote><p>皇帝也不能只喊口號，而得讓老百姓先富起來，然後再教化他們：</p><blockquote><p>「凡正人之道，既富之然後善。……為政於天下者，在乎富之、善之。……徒教化不能使人善。」</p></blockquote><p>他甚至認為，皇帝的合法性並不是絕對的：</p><blockquote><p>「君能順天而效之，則民亦順君而效之也。……及至後世，矯誣上天以布命於下，而欲人之弗叛也，不亦難乎？」</p></blockquote><p>王安石在這裏提及了「天」（天道），而這完全違背了儒家的傳統。在儒學初創的時代，「夫子之言性與天道，不可得而聞」，人與世界的本質這類話題，孔子是絕口不提的。</p><p>而王安石不僅要提，而且提得很激進。他認為人不僅可以認識天道，而且可以主導天道。只要志意精誠，就能「道萬物而無所由，命萬物而無所聽」（超脫規律去引導萬物、超脫命運而安排萬物）。</p><p>「Yes，We Can.」是很有蠱惑力的。對於經濟發達、書籍和知識前所未有普及的北宋來説，王安石的高遠理想比之前的任何學説都更能吸引人。陸遊的爺爺陸佃曾經回顧早年邂逅王安石學説的情景：</p><blockquote><p>「淮之南，學士大夫宗安定先生之學，予獨疑焉。及得荊公《淮南雜説》與其《洪範傳》，心獨謂然。於是願掃臨川先生之門。」</p></blockquote><p>王安石根本不用現身説法，只靠區區兩篇文章，就讓他徹底折服。</p><p>這種自信心的集體膨脹，在歷史上常常出現。只要經濟社會一旦有相當持續、快速的發展，大眾傳媒又加以推波助瀾，結果就很難避免。19 世紀的歐洲、11 世紀的北宋，都是如此。人們會想當然地認為自己既然已經主宰了那麼多，那就能主宰更多，甚至主宰一切。</p><p>就如 19 世紀的進步主義最後會遭遇兩次世界大戰，11 世紀的北宋新儒學也將撞上歷史的南牆。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/5b3e168d-9381-4314-ab52-cb8e2ffcc51b.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>故宮南薰殿舊藏《歷代聖賢名人像冊》之王安石像</figcaption></figure><hr><h2><strong>註釋</strong></h2><pre><code>1 據《廣東通志》卷 39《名宦志》，王安石的父親王益天聖八年（1030）任知韶州。見蔡上翔《王荊公年譜考略》。另參王安石在變法之後所作《答韶州張殿丞書》（《王文公文集》卷 8。同一作者的集子，除首次出現註明全名外，以下簡稱《文集》）。</code></pre><pre><code>2 蘇軾《月華寺（寺鄰岑水場，施者皆坑戶也，百年間蓋）》（《蘇軾詩集》卷 38）説「高巖夜吐金碧氣，曉得異石青斕斑」，又説「月華三火豈天意」，即指此。岑水場乃韶州最大的礦場。</code></pre><pre><code>3 餘靖《韶州新置永通監記》，「韶被山帶海，雜產五金，四方之人，棄農畝、持兵器，慕利而至者不下十萬。」該文作於皇祐二年（1050 年），永通監當年新建，此年王安石三十歲。參張建《餘靖&lt;韶州新置永通監記&gt;考略》。</code></pre><pre><code>4 參徐東昇《宋代銅產量變動原因析論》。</code></pre><pre><code>5 《宋史·食貨下二》：「韶……永通……監，舊額八十萬，至（熙寧）七年（1074），增三十萬，及折二凡五十萬。」</code></pre><pre><code>6 曾鞏與王安石同列「唐宋八大家」，説見其《再與歐陽舍人書》（《元豐類稿》卷 15）。</code></pre><pre><code>7 《宋史·王安石傳》：「擢進士上第，籤書淮南判官。舊制，秩滿許獻文求試館職，安石獨否。再調知鄞縣。」館職系宋代官職體系中一特殊存在，文官加館職，則升遷較速，而且職位清閒且光榮。</code></pre><pre><code>8 司馬光《與王介甫第一書》（《溫國文正司馬公文集》卷 60）：「介甫獨負天下大名三十餘年，才髙而學富，難進而易退，遠近之士，識與不識，鹹謂介甫不起而已，起則太平可立致。」司馬光寫此文時在熙寧三年（1070），由此倒推，在 1040 前後，二十歲的王安石名聲已顯，到 1050 年時，更已有相當名望。</code></pre><pre><code>9 全名《上仁宗皇帝言事書》，又名《上皇帝萬言書》（《文集》卷 1）。</code></pre><pre><code>10 所謂「因天下之力，以生天下之財，取天下之財，以供天下之費。」即出此文。</code></pre><pre><code>11 同上，「今之失，患在不法先王之政者，以謂當法其意而已。夫二帝、三王，相去蓋千有餘載，一治一亂，其盛衰之時具矣。其所遭之變，所遇之勢，亦各不同，其施設之方亦皆殊，而其為天下國家之意，本末先後，未嘗不同也。臣故曰：當法其意而已。法其意，則吾所改易更革，不至乎傾駭天下之耳目，囂天下之口，而固已合乎先王之政矣。」</code></pre><pre><code>12 即《文集》之第 25 卷。</code></pre><pre><code>13 翻譯：「如果有人説自己要遵循美德，那就算他是孤零零的少數派，皇帝也要表彰鼓勵他、不能欺負他；如果有人説自己不遵循美德，那就算他地位高、口碑好，皇帝也必須懲罰他、不能懼怕。欺負少數派而縱容多數人形成朋黨，懼怕地位高、口碑好的人，就忽略他們做的壞事，那是做皇帝最需要警惕的事。」</code></pre><pre><code>14 翻譯：「要讓人走正道，要先讓他們富裕，再讓他們善良。……執政就是要讓老百姓富有、善良。……單單靠教化，沒法讓人向善。」</code></pre><pre><code>15 翻譯：「皇帝能遵循天道、盡力做到，那老百姓就能遵從君王的旨意，也盡力去做。……後世君主有些人假稱自己是天命所歸，卻想大家不背叛，那不是很難嗎？」</code></pre><pre><code>16 《論語·公冶長》。</code></pre><pre><code>17 這是 2008 年奧巴馬競選美國總統的口號，他藉此戰勝原本佔優勢的黨內競爭者希拉里，並最終當選總統。</code></pre><pre><code>18 翻譯：「淮河以南，讀書人和官員都推崇胡瑗的學説，我卻偏偏有所懷疑。等讀到王安石《淮南雜説》和《洪範傳》，心裏覺得特別有道理，於是願意拜王先生為師。」出自陸佃《傅（明孺）府君墓誌》（《陶山集》卷 15）。這裏所説的安定先生即胡瑗，北宋前期著名學者。胡瑗的著作流傳較少，據《宋史》本傳，他的學問講求禮法為多，對義理的獨到發揮較少。這裏所説的王安石《淮南雜説》今也不存，只有少數佚文存世。參金生楊《論王安石&lt;淮南雜説&gt;中的「異志」 思想》。王安石臨川人，臨川即指他。</code></pre>

年 7 月，《美國殘疾人法案》在殘障權利運動與立法者的推動下得以通過。自此，7 月成了美國乃至各國民間的「殘障驕傲月（disability pride month）」，不同障別和身體損傷的人羣在街頭集合，向旁觀者展示自己的殘障身份，同時對社會針對邊緣人羣製造的歧視與裂縫提出挑戰。本文作者維多利亞·李維斯（Victoria Lewis）為當今殘障驕傲的意義提供了歷史註腳：作為脊髓灰質炎患者，她於 60 年代的成長充滿路障，雖然所在的戲劇界充滿了革命和實驗的欣欣向榮，卻依然以健全的身體作為準入標準。回顧這一段過往，李維斯分析了不同殘障女性如何在劇團中學會放下污名，尊重和欣賞每個人獨特的身體特質，並形成擁抱各自脆弱的集體網絡。值得驕傲的不是殘障者翻身變為超人，而是如李維斯借另一位殘障舞者謝麗爾·瑪麗·韋德所説：「你可以既強大又破碎。你可以在堅強的同時有着非比尋常的傷痛和苦楚。」在本文末尾，同為劇場工作者的孫悅星，也提供了她翻譯本文的心路歷程。</p><p>–</p><p>在殘障驕傲月，願不同時空中的餘秀華和李維斯們能夠照亮對方，去舞蹈，去寫詩，去搖搖晃晃地愛，去歡慶自己海星一般的手、月亮一般的足、伊詩比蒂玫瑰一樣綻放的耳朵。</p></blockquote><p>原文作者&nbsp;/&nbsp;維多利亞·李維斯（Victoria

50 年代初，以主流舞台對於身體多樣性的排斥為導火索，美國劇場屆掀起了一場「民主化思潮」：一次對於誰能夠登上舞台、誰的故事得以被講述的重新建構【1】。這場思潮尤為明顯的一個表現是，在 20 世紀 60、70 年代，原本分佈在混合性別、非傳統團體中的女性逐漸走向了以女性為主的集體劇團【2】。本文追溯與之相關的行動：美國西海岸三個由殘障女性組成的戲劇團體的由來：「別的聲音（Other Voices）」（洛杉磯，1982）；「搞怪瘸子幫 （Wry Crips）」（伯克利，1985）；以及 AXIS 舞團（奧克蘭，1987）。</p><p>萌芽於共同的被貶低身份，民主化思潮的第一步往往涉及通過集體創作來建立新的形象表述。如「魔女（Lilith）」女性劇團（譯者注，Lilith，希伯來語為לִּילִית，最早出現於蘇美爾神話，亦同時記載於猶太教的拉比文學。在這些文學中，她被指為亞當的第一個妻子，由上帝用泥土所造。因不願雌伏在亞當身下而離開伊甸園。她也被記載為薩麥爾的情人、夜之魔女，也是法力高強的女巫。）的早期成員卡羅琳·梅爾（Carolyn Myers）所説，（她們的）任務是去找到一個不一樣的故事，一個與主流文化信息「女性天生是次等人，強大的女性註定要被排斥」相左的故事：</p><blockquote><p>我們（女性）都曾被欺騙着……我們被排除在重要事務圈層外。……我們必須學會相信我們自己，相信彼此……以及去傾聽別人講述她們生命中所真實發生的故事以及那些醒悟的瞬間。【3】</p></blockquote><figure

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>「魔女」女性舞團海報，圖源：liliththeater.com</figcaption></figure><p>在發覺自己殘障女性身份的過程中，佩妮·豪爾（Peni Hall）、佩迪·奧芙蘭朵（Patty Overland）、朱迪·史密斯（Judy Smith）、謝麗爾·瑪麗·韋德（Cheryl Marie Wade）以及我自己在內的殘障藝術家們從女性主義劇場實踐中找到了榜樣。我們也都曾有過頓悟的瞬間，意識到我們的身份一度被「謊言所塑造」：消極的形象表述深深根植於公共政策與機構當中。我們分享自己的經歷，努力突破舊有的刻板印象，並對殘障重新進行想象。</p><p>許多殘障研究學者主張，殘障研究衍生於女性主義學説。羅斯瑪麗·格蘭德-湯普森（Rosemarie Garland-Thomson）在她的開創性著作《不尋常的身體：美國文化及文學中對身體殘障的刻畫》（1997）中建立了兩者的關聯，她堅稱「女性特質與殘障在父權文化中被緊密糾纏在一起。」【4】。從亞裏士多德將女性定義為一個「畸形」或「殘缺」的男性開始，格蘭德-湯普森追溯了在西方文化中女性與殘障是如何持續不斷交織在一起的——「常人」僅指於肢體健全的男性，甚至在一段時間內僅指白人。16 年後，在振聾發聵的論著《女性主義，酷兒，瘸子》中，艾莉森·卡福爾（Alison Kafer）強調「女性主義學説給了我理論工具，讓我批判性地思考殘障、對身體多樣性的污名化，以及關於反抗、異議及集體行動的多種模式及策略。」【5】</p><figure class="image"><img

Roth）所定義的「與女性的個人經歷、女性的集體過往以及探索特定女權社會活動策略相關的」【6】女性主義劇場實踐十分相似。儘管如此，一個自成一體、專屬於殘障女性的實踐還是應運而生了。原因何在？</p><p>在尋找答案的過程中，我希望將殘障置於美國劇場界民主化思潮的框架下，並消解「殘障」在文化範疇中被歸為消極及無可救藥的「他者」的表述。同時，當針對殘障的不平等社會結構被暴露出來，我們就能更清楚看見殘障經歷中的獨特性。這些經歷中的很多元素是當下對於平等和普世人權的定義所無法囊括的。遊走於社會建構和本質差異的兩極之間，我意在對根植於劇場集體實踐中的「平等」「平權」概念發出質問，擴充其棲於廣大劇場界的定義。</p><h2><strong>01. 為何自成一體？</strong></h2><p>在 1977 年殘障權利被立法保護之前，殘障人士從未受到過文化界守門人的認可。20 世紀 70 年代前，把殘障劃歸為消極範疇的陳舊觀念，與文化參與、教育培訓及就職途徑的缺失一起，肉眼可見地將殘障者在美國文化生活中的存在剔除了【7】。本文所討論三個劇團的創始及早期成員中，只有三位有過訓練背景：佩妮·豪爾（「搞怪瘸子幫」），邦妮·萊沃茨（AXIS 舞團），以及我自己（「別的聲音」）。萊沃茨和豪爾在身體損傷之前都接受過正統的戲劇及舞蹈訓練。我被專業培訓拒之門外，但在兩家劇團任職的過程中接觸到了非傳統實踐和女性主義實踐。<strong>在殘障劇團的大多數女性甚至都未曾獲得在表演藝術領域的准入資格。但她們都曾受到民主化思潮的感染並直覺性地運用表演藝術的潛力為殘障在文化範疇中正名。</strong></p><p>舞台上下，自由主義與保守主義者都在借用殘障比喻來為自己的議題增加聲量。保守修辭看似最為普遍：一位意志堅定、與殘疾搏鬥戰勝重重磨難的獨立女性，成為了引導個人主義的典範。然而左翼的文化建制似乎與右翼一樣，受困於主流的錯誤觀點中。因此，一大批戰爭及資本主義下可憐的殘疾的受害者形象，以及如評論家尤那·喬杜裏有力指出為「偽悲劇」的慷慨自戕（heroic suicide）（譯校注：指美國現當代文化作品中經常體現的「如果殘疾，則寧願去死」的故事情節）【8】，紛紛出現在如布萊恩·克拉克的《究竟是誰的人生？》和保羅·海金斯的《百萬美元寶貝》【9】等的戲劇和電影中。自 20 世紀 70 年代中葉以來，殘障活動家、學者及藝術家拒絕了殘障的「醫療模型」——殘障人士是患病且無法自理的，或是被有效「治癒」的英雄式的身殘志堅者。如今，殘障活動家和藝術家將殘障置於一個社會建構的、歷史定義下的體系中來講述：即「社會模型」，一個能夠提供個人及政治洞察視角，使集體行動成為可能的範式。</p><figure class="image"><img

60 年代為開端講述殘障女性實踐如何從女性主義劇場浮現出來，西方劇場的民主化思潮其實可追溯到革命時期的法國——就在這一時期，對於貴族階級的革命性表述首次出現：「天性柔弱似女子，生來又瘸又瞎」【10】。<strong>這樣的比喻影響了之後兩個世紀眾多激進的劇場實踐，將男子氣概和自理能力視為優越。</strong>殘障史學家道格拉斯·貝恩頓（Douglas Baynton）探索了殘障隱喻如何貫穿於 19 世紀及 20 世紀早期關於公民資格的大辯論，如女性投票權，非裔美國人的自由及公民權利，以及對於移民的限制等議題【11】。正如貝恩頓所發現的，在將這三類人視為「殘障」、將解放視為進一步致殘中，歧視被理所當然地正當化了。醫生們一度堅稱，「屈服於強者的需求深植於非裔美國人體內」：證據就存在於其「跪拜儀式」（genu flexit）當中，非裔美國人的膝蓋天生易於跪拜【12】。至於解放，則帶給了非裔美國人「一場心理和生理上的顯著衰退。」 【13】與此相似，這批醫生還曾強調，女性受教育會導致生育器官「萎縮、變形、變弱以及生病。」【14】來自南歐和東歐的移民則被判斷為軟弱且有缺陷，有玷污英裔美國人基因池的威脅。【15】由此，毫不驚訝，被剝奪公民權利的、力圖爭取平權的羣體，曾經試圖將自己與「瘸子、殘疾、瞎子」拉開儘可能大的距離。擺脫被污名化籠罩的殘障，堅決強調自身的男子氣概、獨立及完好，為這些被剝削者提供過躋身一等公民的門票。</p><h2><strong>02. 懸置的污名管理: 「安全水域」</strong></h2><p>1982 年，當我創建「別的聲音」（1982-2002）這個專屬於殘障女性的工作坊項目時，我還是一名「魔女」劇團的成員（1978-1981）。我借用了「魔女」所使用的肢體劇場練習和「個人的就是政治的」故事講述方法。殘障女性真實經歷的故事因其特殊性、驚人的反轉及共鳴，使其在馬可提潑劇院的排練室之外亦引發反響，並最終在 1984 年形成了一檔特別電視節目——「告訴他們我是人魚」，由自由派擁護者諾曼·李爾出品，社會活動家/藝術家簡·方達主持。</p><figure class="image"><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>電視節目「告訴他們我是人魚」（1984）截圖。圖源：https://archive.org/details/tellthemimamermaid</figcaption></figure><p>在這樣的成功背後，是集體創作為新敍事奠定了基礎。芭芭拉·維斯曼將她打破身體侷限性的能力歸功於共享污名：「移動胳膊和雙手對我來説總歸是很冒險的。我太顯眼了。（在工作坊的）其他每個人亦是如此。」【16】在這個團體中的肢體自由，以及隨之而來的扣人心絃的故事，都來自於「污名管理」（stigma management）的懸置，「污名管理」由社會學家歐文·戈夫曼在《污名：受損身份管理札記》（1963）中提出。對於殘障人士而言，「污名管理」描述了為顯得「正常」而採取的社交手段。如評論家格蘭德-湯普森所解釋的，這種「塗臉秀」（minstrelsy），對「正常」的表演，就是被主流社會接受所要付出的代價。</p><figure class="image"><img

href="http://amazon.com/">amazon.com</a></p><p>當燒傷倖存者芭芭拉·卡馬拉將工作坊描述為一個「柔軟且安全的空間」，創造了「充分自由的場域去發揮，且充滿意義」時【17】，她也在部分描述着懸置污名管理所帶來的效果。同樣的敍述也出現在「搞怪瘸子幫」的集體排練中，詩人/劇作家謝麗爾·瑪麗·韋德如是説：「這是一片安全的水域，當你試圖理解你感受到的到底是什麼、甚至去嘗試着去表達殘障的經歷時，你可以安全地漂浮其上」。佩妮·豪爾將「搞怪瘸子幫」的集體創作過程描述為：「一個塞子被拔掉了，接着你就可以去説更多，感受更多」。她同時補充道，「對於許多女性來説，當房間裏有男性存在時，安全感會消失」。【18】與同時期的其他進步運動一樣，殘障人權運動也存在着男性主導和性別歧視的問題。</p><p>「柔軟」與「安全」並不是能夠與 20 世紀六七十年代非傳統戲劇所聯繫在一起的特質。激進的非傳統劇團繼承了對「人民」一詞的社會主義詮釋，強調有男子氣概和個人臨危不懼的勇氣。艾瑞克·霍布斯鮑姆（Eric Hobsbawm）提到，在社會主義運動當中人民肖像逐漸「男性化」，從十九世紀早期裸露上身的《自由引導人民》變為有着強健肌肉的男性形象。【19】在 20 世紀二三十年代的德國，眾多知名的社會主義工人合唱隊同意女性加入傳統的混合團，卻將她們從革命歌曲的演唱中排除在外；女性的聲音在當時被認為過高過細，不適合表達激進的情緒。【20】</p><figure class="image"><img

世紀歐仁·德拉克羅瓦《自由引導人民》原畫。圖源：wikipedia</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>03. 獨立/相互依存/依賴：那些故事</strong></h2><p>「獨立」（independence），「相互依存」（interdependence）和「依賴」（dependence）這三個詞語在殘障權利運動的發展中扮演了極其重要的角色，正如該運動也在法律和民間討論中都與「自立生活運動」緊密相連。社會活動的先驅者們意識到被視為依賴者的風險，便將「獨立」一詞重新主張為非自理（autonomy）而是自立（agency），並以此來反叛醫療系統高高在上的控制和缺乏無障礙設施的社會環境對殘障者的孤立。</p><p>獨立並非是自理而是自立的觀念在「別的聲音」工作坊裏產生的故事中體現得十分明顯。不同於大眾媒體所描繪的奇蹟般的治癒場景「我能再次行走！」，許多上肢力量受限的女性會將把手動輪椅換成電動的視為解放。現在，她們可以依照自己的意志行動了。<strong>在這個羣體中，輪椅非但不是依賴，反而是獨立的象徵。</strong></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9f40f97e-514a-4a3c-b1cf-6280d39e4b20.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>「別的聲音」舞團工作坊，1982。圖源：原文</figcaption></figure><p>殘障藝術家堅持認為，諸如此類的故事只會來自於殘障經歷中。女演員伊塔莉亞·迪託的故事正是如此。迪託在兩歲時於厄瓜多爾與小兒麻痹症「結緣」。當她們舉家搬遷至美國後，伊塔莉亞被放入一家醫院裏，從兩歲住到十二歲。據迪託所述，她不會講英語的父母「不停地簽署手術同意書，卻並不知道在我身上會發生什麼。」迪託八歲時，她開始説英語並且</p><blockquote><p>「開始問許多關於自己手術的問題。我親眼所見，醫生們根本不知道自己在做什麼。他們只不過是在我身上練習新的外科手術而已。是的，我想走路，想變成一個‘正常’人。「……」當我從「……最後」一台手術中甦醒過來時，我爸爸站在我身邊，我對他説，‘爸爸，不要再做手術了，拜託了。我不能走路沒關係。我只想在這些醫院圍牆之外過生活，我會盡我所能讓它變成最好的人生。’」【22】</p></blockquote><p>迪託的故事很新。治癒與戰勝——殘障故事中標準的戲劇高潮，在這裏變成了危險的源頭。這個女英雄，一個十二歲的小姑娘，看到了她周圍所有人都看不到的：即獨立是關於自立而不是自理；即種族歧視和階級偏見可以隱身在先進醫療科學的假面之後。</p><p>研究福利國家的歷史學者黛博拉·斯通觀察到，「兩個世紀以來對於無堅不摧的個人主義的造神，不會輕易向‘依賴是人類生存所需’這一疼痛的事實低頭。」【23】可以説，<strong>殘障劇作，使「我們文化中過度強調獨立」【24】的現象得以顯形。</strong>近年來，殘障學者和社會活動家從「獨立」逐步轉向「相互依存」，用以更加準確地描述出包括殘障人士在內全體人類的生活經歷、以及過度強調基於自理和個體力量的平等觀如何對集體福祉造成了危險。</p><h2><strong>04. 「搞怪瘸子幫」劇團：身體與性</strong></h2><p>（1958 年女子四重唱組合 the Cordettes 歌曲《棒棒糖》的曲調）</p><blockquote><p>身體部位，身體部位</p><p>哦吼，身體、身體部位（X2）</p><p>我有海星一樣的手/我有月亮一樣的足</p><p>我有像伊詩比蒂玫瑰一樣綻放的耳朵</p></blockquote><p>謝麗爾·瑪麗·韋德對於流行歌曲《棒棒糖》充滿歡樂的戲仿表演誕生於她在「搞怪瘸子幫」殘障女性劇團中的成長。韋德，這個在 20 世紀八九十年代殘障文化中的「時髦女郎」，曾因獨角戲《野蠻女孩》獲頒美國國家藝術基金（NEA）獨立藝術家獎金，在進入劇團時卻顯得信心不足——她説：「無論我當時多麼激進，我一度都沒辦法與自己的身體和解。」參加「搞怪瘸子幫」是韋德成長為一名錶演者和寫作者的轉折點：</p><blockquote><p>（搞怪瘸子幫）最妙的地方在於，能夠在這裏作為一個殘疾女性暢所欲言。……我從沒想過要針對自己的身份表達什麼，直到加入劇團。……我在搞怪瘸子幫找到了自己的聲音。【26】</p></blockquote><figure

年來到奧克蘭，在輪椅運動中相遇。奧芙蘭將劇團的創立歸功於一次浪漫邂逅。「我當時正和一個來自‘母語’（女性主義劇團）的演員約會」，她回憶説，「我只想着她去哪我就去哪。」之後，女友帶她去看「胖嘴脣」劇團（反對肥胖壓迫）的一場演出，奧芙蘭創立「搞怪瘸子幫」的主意就在那時誕生了。【27】</p><p>如同前輩「母語」劇團一樣，「搞怪瘸子幫」也反對所有的等級制度。那時沒有面試，沒有導演/編劇/演員的區別稱呼【28】。如果你想表演，那你就算加入了。她們擁抱所有類型的殘障及經歷，並堅信在一個殘障女性團體中發現個人真相的力量。【29】劇團裏的所有人都在創作——詩歌、獨白、短劇，同時所有人都表演。佩妮·豪爾曾在早年間擔任劇團內戲劇構作和行政管理工作，她描述選角和修改劇本的過程會確保讓「每一個人都有‘閃光時刻’，都能有機會把最好的自己展示出來。」【30】不贊同對「更優秀」的朗誦者的特別優待。沒有人會被「遺忘在角落」。</p><p>「搞怪瘸子幫」劇團就像那時候的很多團體一樣，就意識形態而言在團隊合作的過程中並不順暢，有時甚至是充滿爭執。但是，據帕蒂·奧芙蘭所説，有一點是團隊內部全體認同的：將她們自己展現得性感。「不論是直的還是彎的，我們想讓大家知道我們為了自己的性而驕傲，因為人們總是（會説）‘就那些人，她們哪兒談得上性感？’」【31】</p><p>文學評論家蘭納德·戴維斯提出，殘障人士往往被「去情慾化」（de-eroticized）【32】。早期統計數據印證了戴維斯的這個觀點，去情慾化對殘障女性造成了特定負擔。【33】較一般女性而言，殘障女性更不容易結婚，同時更易遭到離婚。與已婚殘障男性相比，當病情發作時，已婚殘障女性更易遭到離婚或分居。殘障女性被否定的角色恰恰是非殘障女性當時極力想要擺脫的：母親和妻子。無法得到女性傳統社會角色的接納，使得一部分殘障女性主義者們形容自己為「社會流浪者」，因為再沒有其他稱呼了。【34】</p><p>「搞怪瘸子幫」劇團因慶祝性和殘障女性的身體而被大眾所知。在推動這一方向中，或許沒有任何人能比謝麗爾·瑪麗·韋德更有發言權。韋德有漸進性幼年型類風濕性關節炎，雙手的狀態讓她尤為窘迫。她回憶道：「多年來我一直拿着一個披肩或是一個大挎包，這樣我就能把自己的手伸進去，人們就不會感覺不舒服，我也不會被人們的目光所羞辱了。」【35】</p><p>一開始韋德和劇團一起表演時，她把自己從脖子到腳裹進寬鬆的、看不出身型的衣服裏。她的聲音始終在場——迷人且動聽，時而又變成柔軟性感的粗嗓門、用着嘲諷的語氣。但當她的表演自信逐漸增長，「偽裝剝落了」。她穿上了裙子，這樣當她説起自己愛人對她的觀察「你膝蓋上的疤在一起好像兩瓣嘴脣，在微笑」時，她便撩起來讓大家看。傷疤是真實存在的，無聲的康康舞（譯校注：康康舞為一種 19 世紀末起源於法國的音樂廳舞蹈，著名呈現如《紅磨坊》）也同樣真實。有一首情詩叫《變形的無尾禮服》，寫了兩個剛剛戀愛的人，喝着紅酒，談着丹麥哲學家齊克果，看着貓咪晃動的尾巴，等待夜幕降臨。詩如是寫道：</p><blockquote><p>當天空變作深夜的藍</p><p>你起誓，而我深信不疑</p><p>我蜷曲的爪子</p><p>是閃爍的銀色月光 【36】</p></blockquote><p>然而，韋德對殘障政治立場中的部分觀點——如果社會歧視和偏見都被消除，那麼殘障人士就可以平等地參與社會生活——表示懷疑。對於韋德來説，這個説法拒不承認是「身體的能力」在決定我們什麼可以做、什麼不能。疼痛也隨之被否認，因為「這和我們努力展現自己有力強大的形象格格不入」【37】她總結道：「<strong>你可以既強大又破碎。你可以在堅強的同時有着非比尋常的傷痛和苦楚。</strong>」【38】重申差異而非平等，這是韋德的作品本身告訴我們的，它將藝術從政治主張中區分開來。</p><p></p><h2><strong>05. AXIS 舞團和身體差異性</strong></h2><blockquote><p>對我來説最大的差異在於，我們説（《P.H.*惡作劇》的演員們）是一個整體，但她們每個人又完全不同，這比（我之前合作過的）任何團體都更多樣。【39】</p><p>——內奧米·戈德堡，編舞《P.H.*惡作劇》：講述殘障人士隱祕的歷史由「別的聲音」劇團創作，1994

【40】膝蓋受傷把她從傳統舞蹈的世界中分離開來，推動她參與接觸即興，接觸非傳統學生。即便經驗豐富至此，《P.H.*惡作劇》中的八個演員也還是為戈德堡打開了新的篇章。</p><p>形成一種集體聲音的困難從始至終伴隨着殘障戲劇創作。謝麗爾·瑪麗·韋德就曾因為自己的詩《野蠻女孩》與「搞怪瘸子幫」劇團的另一位成員發生了爭執。模仿跳繩的節奏，以伯克利大街上大膽的殘障女性為靈感，這首詩讚美着「畸形足的安妮穿着閃亮的紅鞋」，以及「目盲的老威爾瑪每天讀一本小説」。共有八位女性出現在詩中，並伴隨着八種不同的障別。但劇團的一位成員拒絕出演這首詩，因為她覺得這首詩沒能把所有的殘障類型都覆蓋到。</p><p>回顧 AXIS 舞團的歷史——一個在 20 世紀 80 年代末誕生、致力於殘障舞者和非殘障舞者融合的團體【41】，可以看到 AXIS 始終在與殘障女性集體作品中的主要矛盾進行角力：非殘障領導者與殘障領導者，業餘主義與專業主義，服務於整個社羣與服務於個體藝術。但究其根源，AXIS 舞團一直以來都在舞台上展現那些不符合傳統舞蹈中「理想」身體的、曾被視為禁忌的、只適合出現在怪人秀和醫療展示中的身體。忌諱是如此嚴重，以至於 1994 年，《紐約客》的舞蹈評論家阿勒尼·克羅齊拒絕出席觀看比爾·T·瓊斯與一些患有不治之症的人所創作的作品《依然如故（Still Here）》，並稱其為「受害者藝術」【42】。如果克羅齊的文章是想要阻止「不合適的身體」再次出現在大型音樂廳的舞台上，那麼它失敗了。作為迴應，舞蹈經紀人傑瑞米·阿里戈開始了對全球範圍內融合藝術團體的研究，並於 1997 年在波士頓製作了第一個輪椅舞國際藝術節。從世界各地而來的團體以對話和舞動的方式講述着彼此的故事。阿里戈邀請 AXIS 舞團主理人朱迪·史密斯一起策劃藝術節，在波士頓，史密斯漸漸走出以社羣為基礎的藝術，轉向了更具挑戰性的專業舞蹈領域。</p><figure class="image"><img

舞團中的表演，圖源：原文</figcaption></figure><p>當朱迪·史密斯、泰安斯·馬祖爾以及邦妮·萊克維茲於 1987 年成立 AXIS 時【43】，她們在非傳統藝術扎堆的加州灣區一眾集體藝術初創公司中並不起眼。史密斯和馬祖爾相識於「手拉手」女子自衞武術學校，當非殘障者、有着舞蹈背景的職業心理諮詢師馬祖爾邀請史密斯一同創作一個舞蹈作品時，史密斯當時「對舞蹈一無所知，一無所知」【44】。而史密斯高中畢業那年因車禍而受傷之前，她曾夢想着以馬術師為業：</p><blockquote><p>我對它（舞蹈）十分感興趣。（因為）一是，它是一種鍛鍊……我喜歡這一點，這和我之前學馬術一樣——這是一種極限的自我鍛鍊。【45】</p></blockquote><p>AXIS 與「別的聲音」和「搞怪瘸子幫」一樣，在早年間也有着開放原則：如果你想做，那就歡迎你來做。因污名化的身體而被主流表演文化拒之門外的藝術家們，在 AXIS 找到了歸宿。因此，當史密斯從波士頓回到奧克蘭，她所提議的邀請職業（即「非殘障」）編舞家進行創作的想法受到了冷遇。聯合創始人泰安斯·馬祖爾就是反對者之一。但是，馬祖爾作為一個非殘障的舞團成員本身就已是矛盾。創團十年，馬祖爾和她的男性伴侶依然主導着面向殘障羣體的舞蹈工作坊，依然假定這一位置所需的專業性，依然堅持把這樣的工作僅當作為教化工具去培養殘障意識。</p><p>史密斯最終獲得了舞團的控制權，並與世界一流的編舞家如桑雅·戴爾懷德、喬·古德、瑪格麗特·詹金斯、史蒂芬·彼得羅尼奧、維多利亞·馬克思以及比爾·T·瓊斯等展開了合作。舞團以行動向那些對融合舞蹈概念説不的人發出挑戰。【46】</p><p>據史密斯所述，2014 年舞團的工作流程，與在泰安斯·馬祖爾指導時的流程並無大的改變。身體的差異性是玄妙的，即便是在創始人史密斯和邦妮·萊克維茲之間也不例外。史密斯解釋道：「我們以完全不同的方式舞動——我們是不可互換的。」【47】非殘障舞者的體重和身高也被列入建立複雜而充滿運動性的組合的考慮之中，輪椅的種類也是。所有人——包括世界一流的編舞家——都在努力思考可以在一起創作出什麼的問題。</p><p>比爾·T·瓊斯於 2000 年為 AXIS 編創了舒伯特的《C 調狂想曲》，回顧這段經歷時，他説自己努力「去找到一個具有共享性的舞動語彙」。【48】作為一個以齊舞見長的編舞家，他「驚訝於在身體能動性不同的表演者之間找同步性，需要付出多麼大的努力。在這兒，每個人的胳膊、軀幹和腿都遵循着不同的運動規則，或者説根本沒有規則。」瓊斯糾結於是否將「快速運動（跑步、行走、跳躍）加入到韻律之中——和輪椅一起，無論是手動的還是電動的。」對於瓊斯來説，這些差異帶來的是美學上的新可能，而非政治意義上的絆腳石。【49】</p><p>正如比爾·T·瓊斯所言，在 AXIS 的作品當中，「每個人都可以被看作是一份文本」，而這些身體所形成的「星系」，則共同構成了故事本身。從 AXIS 眾多的肉身和鋼鐵之中生髮出來的，是新創造、新現實和新神話。《紐約時報》評論員布魯斯·韋伯在他關於 AXIS 的文章中如此建議讀者：</p><blockquote><p>「同情」與此毫不相關。忘掉什麼不在場，去關注什麼在場。看到輪椅本身，而不是把它看成是什麼的替代品。看到了嗎？……輪椅傾向一側，一隻輪子在空中翻飛，一名舞者在輪椅之上橫躺着，緩慢而優雅地旋轉着，是輪椅成就了這樣一副動人的畫面。【50】</p></blockquote><p>AXIS 舞團百花齊放的圖景反映在對區別與平等的調和中。在這一過程中，<strong>受損的身體並不被歸於一個四肢可被修復、輪椅使用者可以重新在田野間奔跑的泛泛的天堂，而是轉向於充分認識並最大限度地開發舞團成員的身體差異。</strong>「受損」的身體所使用的助行類輔具，被整合入藝術性的舞動當中，平等不僅存在於團隊規範和受到保護的個人自主權當中，還在相互依存的網絡中得到充分體現。幾十年的創作歷程，使得 AXIS 融合舞團在如何找到平等和差異之間平衡的問題上，提供了啓發性的範例。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f11a4676-f799-4d96-a109-080f180bef18.jpeg/public"

結語</strong></h2><p>集體創作在美國劇場界的民主化進程當中充當着不可或缺的角色，同時它也是民主化進程在美學和公民意識上的重要成果。正如我們所見，身體本身是戲劇改革的號召力所在。儘管在科班培訓和職業僱傭當中的固有偏見依然存在，但邊緣羣體依舊在劇場實踐當中尋找突破口，樹立人類新典型。</p><p>但我並非在忽視長久以來將「殘障」假定為負面形象所帶來的傷害，這種假設依舊陰魂不散於我們的排練室中和舞台之上。希望這些簡短的案例分析能夠較為清晰地讓讀者注意到，<strong>劇場和舞蹈界（無論是傳統的還是自由派的，女性主義的還是混合的）的准入規則看似平等，然而平等的標準依然以健全身體為前提，且未曾經過檢驗和反思。</strong>本文所列舉出的成果，實際上在向整個行業發問：如果我們去注重差異，對依存和病弱去污名化，我們還將收穫多少？</p><p>本文更廣的道德啓示則是劇場藝術家們每天都在實踐的，即：絕對的獨立是不可能的。正如一些進化生物學家所提出的假説，人類物種成功的關鍵並非是「適者生存」，而是聚在一起，相互依存，共建集體。</p><p><br

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkyOTAwOTQwMg==&amp;mid=2247488318&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=fd6db18b16b501cbdc710c12cfe41969&amp;chksm=c21148abf566c1bdd89f33c8cdecc17d53ee002d89eedb91aa8d1ebc543b9749039068a63ae6&amp;scene=21#wechat_redirect">星空藝術節</a>的節目經理，我有幸接觸並學習了不少國內外殘障/融合藝術團體創作的優秀作品，但由於偏線上工作的性質，我對本地殘障團體以及 TA 們真實的生活狀態缺乏深度瞭解，因此會質疑自己是否能夠由殘障人士的主體性出發去思考問題，覺得自己作為普遍意義上的「健全人」從事與殘障相關的工作缺乏正當性。而文中展現的殘障研究和女性主義學説之間的關聯為我提供了一個新的視角：即通過作為女性的生活經驗去接近殘障人士的生活經驗，去發現其中的種種共通之處與差異。這將是一個嶄新的、能夠賦予我極大信心的起點，帶我逐步走進真正的瞭解與共情。</p><p>以上是我閲讀、翻譯之間的感悟，如也能對大家有所啓發是我的榮幸！最後，作為表演藝術從業者，同時也作為表演藝術常年的觀眾，我想要向大家着重提及文中對於欣賞殘障團體藝術作品的動人表述：</p><blockquote><p>「‘同情’與此毫不相關。忘掉什麼不在場，去關注什麼在場。看到輪椅本身，而不是把它看成是什麼的替代品。看到了嗎？……輪椅傾向一側，一隻輪子在空中翻飛，一名舞者在輪椅之上橫躺着，緩慢而優雅地旋轉着，是輪椅成就了這樣一副動人的畫面。」</p></blockquote><p>未來，希望我們都能夠拋開「同情」的枷鎖，心無旁騖地去欣賞、去讚美、去創作。</p><h2><strong>最新文章（持續更新）</strong></h2><ol

把小説翻譯成英語，再應用區塊鏈相關技術出版成雙語電子書。</p><p>我本來就支持創作尤其是書寫，威文兄又分屬老友，更是社羣的中堅份子，我沒有推辭的理由。連自己的舊作都沒有時間翻譯和推出電子版，就拍拍胸口，信口開河答應幫忙出版<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

版本製作等安排，偏偏遇上香港「五百年一遇」的暴雨，到會議當天中午黑雨警告雖然已經除下，但多區嚴重水浸，觀塘線更被癱瘓，但無論作者、出版社、平台還是我這個助手全都期待早日完成這個專案，居然在停課停工停市的下午，成功從各區匯集到灣仔的紅出版辦公室，除了把各項安排談妥，威文兄更即席示範詠春招式，由紅出版拍攝，並錄製成短片隨新版附送。</p><p>會後，負責製作電子版的我取得 pdf 格式的文本，轉換成可編輯的 docx 檔，刪掉不合用的格式與圖片，讓 Microsoft Word 重新生成目錄，再使用&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>&nbsp;把 docx 轉換成 epub3 格式。經過兩三次檢查 epub 檔案、修訂 docx 及再次轉換成 epub3 格式，正體中文版<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

檔因此也能輕鬆完成。</p><p>比較複雜的是中英雙語版，但相對於傳統靠人手從零開始翻譯，只能算是工夫略多而已。先準備好 VPN 與海外信用卡，註冊&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>&nbsp;帳號並訂閲，然後從 Github clone 下&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/yihong0618/bilingual_book_maker">bilingual_book_maker</a>，安裝相應的&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>&nbsp;環境，就能配合 GPT 使用，不消一會就把文本翻譯成英語，再交由威文兄與紅出版檢查。</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/yihong0618/bilingual_book_maker">bilingual_book_maker</a>&nbsp;允許用戶選擇搭配不同的 LLM 模型，除了 GPT-3、4 也包括&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2">Claude2</a>&nbsp;等，雖然 GPT 比較貴，而 GPT-4 又比 GPT-3 貴十倍以上，我還是建議選擇 GPT-4，因為真正的成本其實是 AI 翻譯後的人手編輯，只要 AI 的輸出好一點點，後期省下的人力成本就肯定超過 GPT-4 的額外成本。</p><p>抱歉寫了幾段火星話，被吐槽文章難懂，我是沒有藉口的。技術的部分就此打住，11 月的讀書會將採用工作坊的形式，出席者請準備好大作，我會跟大家一起把文本製作成為電子版，鑄造成 NFT 書，並講解如何放到 Liker Land 等平台出售。</p><figure class="image"><img

Jewish children would do the same, visiting Najame’s school to learn about her life.Haifa is not like the rest of Israel, Najame says.「We live together here, Arab people and Jewish people. We work together, we go to the same places,」 she told CNN.</p><p>打破這種平靜的不是以色列的民族政策，而是恐怖襲擊。Naim Khoury, a lawyer who lives in Haifa, said the city is normally an oasis of coexistence. The 39-year-old lawyer, who lives in Haifa, said the fallout from the brutality of October is being felt even there, in a city usually considered a case study of successful coexistence.「Some people look at us with suspicion now because we are Arabs. And being an Arab means being a terrorist,」 he told CNN. 「But we condemn terrorists, we condemn everything they have done and we (mourn) every life lost.」Khoury said that he has many friends who serve in the military and the police, and yet even they sometimes face similar suspicion.「In Haifa, we always try to preserve the good relations and to have this coexistence and so it’s very sad that every time anything to do with security happens, Jews are automatically asking me, ‘What do you think about it as an Arab, are you okay with this?’ 」 he said.</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener

2007 年的封鎖行動與哈馬斯掌權有着較為直接的聯繫，有其緣由，值得進一步探討。</p><p>「哈馬斯」組織本次的軍事行動代號為「阿克薩洪水」。這個代號很講究。「阿克薩」是一座清真寺的名字，該清真寺的地位僅次於麥加聖寺和麥地那先知寺。位於以色列耶路撒冷老城的聖殿山（穆斯林稱「尊貴禁地」）。</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer

年來，生活在那裏的巴勒斯坦人民一直處於以色列實際上相當於封鎖的長期關閉和嚴厲的經濟和行動限制之下。實際上，近 200 萬人大多被限制在一塊 365 平方公里的飛地上，該地是世界上人口密度最高的地區之一。進入加沙地帶的貨物僅限於基本的人道主義產品。1 除長期關閉和嚴厲的經濟和行動限制之外，加沙在六年中 (從 2008 年 12 月開始) 還遭受了三輪重大敵對行動，導致生產基地被摧毀，而隨後發生的嚴重危機則使加沙地帶變成人道主義問題，使加沙嚴重依賴援助。此外，巴勒斯坦內部分裂對加沙發展構成重大挑戰。加沙是全球經濟表現最差的地區之一，也是世界失業率最高的地區，3 一半以上人口生活在貧困線以下。絕大多數人口無法獲得清潔用水、電或適當的污水系統，而且，加沙地帶的環境嚴重惡化。自 2007 年開始關閉和嚴厲的經濟和行動限制以來，加沙的巴勒斯坦人民經歷了 13 年來周圍條件的持續惡化。</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

年根據聯合國大會決議要求，向聯大提交的一份題為《以色列佔領給巴勒斯坦人民造成的經濟代價：關閉和限制下的加沙地帶》的報告原文，供大家參考。「值得注意的是，在自 2007 年開始的對加沙地帶長達 16 年的封鎖中，加沙地帶的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人的生存條件日漸惡劣，貧困水平惡化，基礎設施遭到破壞。這種行為可能無法廣泛代表以色列人對巴勒斯坦人的態度，但這種行為可能直接導致在加沙地區生存巴勒斯坦人對以色列態度的惡化。回顧近十幾年的歷史，溫水煮青蛙一般的封鎖行動本身也是打破平靜、破壞地區居民基本生存發展權的事件之一。」</p><figure class="image"><img

51 條。根據這一條款，成員國有權在受到武裝攻擊時採取自衞行動，直至聯合國安理會採取必要的措施來維護國際和平與安全。</p></li><li><p>自衞的條件：通常來説，只有在受到武裝攻擊時，國家才能行使自衞權。而且，自衞行動應當是立即的、必要的，並且與攻擊的規模和性質相適應。</p></li><li><p>集體自衞和預防自衞，但不在本次話題討論範圍中。</p></li></ol><p>基於此認識，那位聯合國官員認為以色列是有普遍意義的自衞權的，比如遭受的其他國家的侵略，以色列當然可以像烏克蘭一樣拿起武器保衞祖國，這個觀點我是認同的。</p><p></p><p>@*臨</p><p>在傳統的國際法框架下，這個自衞通常被理解為一個國家在受到其他國家的武裝攻擊時，採取必要的、適度的軍事行動以保護其主權和領土完整。這種自衞的理解基於國家間的相互關係和國家主權的基本原則。但是這一原則在反恐面前受到了一定程度的挑戰。比如在 9/11 恐怖襲擊之後，其面臨的主要威脅來自非國家行為者，特別是恐怖組織如基地組織。這些組織沒有固定的領土基礎，也不受任何國家法律的約束，但它們的行動對美國和其盟國構成了嚴重的安全威脅。在這種情況下，美國通過國際法中的自衞權概念應用於非國家行為者的威脅，從而為其反恐戰爭提供法律依據。但是，這樣做也帶來了一些負面影響，我前文中就講到這些影響，這裏不贅述。這裏以色列和美國一直主張的所謂自衞權，在我看來倒不如換成「鎮壓權」更準確。以色列不承認巴勒斯坦是個國家，也就喪失了傳統意義上的聯合國憲章的第 51 條定義的自衞，其單邊的軍事行動不能認為是戰爭。他們不能兩頭都佔便宜。以色列不承認巴勒斯坦是個國家，也就喪失了傳統意義上的聯合國憲章的第 51 條定義的自衞，其單邊的軍事行動不能認為是戰爭。他們不能兩頭都佔便宜。需要尊重主權的時候説巴勒斯坦不是國家，需要報復的時候説我們有國與國之間的自衞權，這是雙標。</p><p></p><p>@*利</p><p>那麼在本次事件的初始階段您認為是「自衞」的成分多一點，還是「鎮壓」的成分多一點呢？我這樣問是因為本次哈馬斯對音樂會發動的襲擊完全符合恐襲的三個基本定義:使用暴力，政治目的，針對平民。</p><p></p><p>@*臨</p><p>我認為就是報復，用鐵血對野蠻的報復。以色列如果自稱是文明國家，就要有着比野蠻更高的標準。就像秦暉説的：世界上只有不擇手段的邪惡，根本不存在什麼不擇手段的正義。就是這個道理。</p><p></p><p>@*羽</p><p>您好，我想問一下，自衞權只能針對主權國家發動的國際法根據是什麼呢？或者説，是否有國際成文法或國際習慣法禁止一個主權國家向自己不承認為主權國家的政治實體發動自衞權？</p><p></p><p>@*臨</p><p>第五十一條：聯合國任何會員國受武力攻擊時，在安全理事會採取必要辦法，以維持國際和平及安全以前，本憲章不得認為禁止行使單獨或集體自衞之自然權利。會員國因行使此項自衞權而採取之辦法，應立向安全理事會報告，此項辦法於任何方面不得影響該會按照本憲章隨時採取其所認為必要行動之權責，以維持或恢復國際和平及安全。</p><p>相關鏈接：<a

條並沒有限定國家只能在「遭遇另一個主權國家的武力攻擊」時才能使用自衞權。</p><p></p><p>@*臨</p><p>以色列的口徑是戰爭，然而，「反恐戰爭」其實不是戰爭，而是單方面的軍事行動。在聯合國憲章框架內，戰爭的對象是國與國之間。「反恐戰爭」 war on terror 是美國政客的比喻。和「禁毒戰爭」 war on drugs 一樣。這種單方面的軍事行動，受到的政治法律約束比戰爭更多。這種單方面的軍事行動，它的對象、目標是不明確的，外延模糊的，無時間限制的。這和傳統意義上的戰爭是有很大的區別的。</p><p></p><p>@*羽</p><p>所以，是否有國際法（包括成文法，習慣法，和國際仲裁機構的判例）指出一個主權國家不得針對一個未被其承認為主權國家的政治實體發起自衞權呢？但是並沒有任何聯合國憲章的條款將第 51 條的適用範圍限定於「戰爭」，第 51 條全文沒有使用「戰爭/war」一詞。</p><p></p><p>@*dyyy</p><p>以色列的口徑是戰爭，這個有出處嗎？</p><p></p><p>@*臨</p><p>現在，以色列聲稱「第二階段戰爭」已開始了。</p><p></p><p>@*羽</p><p>在過往的軍事衝突中，我們實際上經常能夠看到一個國家的武裝力量針對一個其不承認為主權國家/尚未建交的政治實體的行為行駛自衞權的情況。2001 年 12 月 22 日日本海上保安廳與朝鮮偵察船之間的交火就是一個典型例子，在這一事件後，國際社會和國際法學界幾乎沒有（我從未看到過，也沒檢索到）指控「由於日本沒有正式承認北朝鮮政府，所以日本海上執法部門不得行使自衞權/不得向其偵察船還擊並追擊」。</p><p>（在這裏説一下我關於相關話題的個人看法：我認為以色列針對哈馬斯的武裝襲擊有自衞權，但是當前的轟炸和地面軍事行動顯著地超出了自衞權的範圍，其中有一些可以被形容為「打着自衞權名義的武裝攻擊」，和自衞行為已經沒有實質上的聯繫。我認為以色列的行動超出了自衞權的範圍/和自衞行為已經沒有實質上的聯繫的國際習慣法依據是 1837 年的卡洛萊茵事件（Caroline affair）中提出的「韋伯斯特（Webster）基準」。「韋伯斯特基準」可能更多在日文資料或由日文資料翻譯而來的資料中看到，可能在更多的英文資料中用「卡洛萊茵基準（Caroline test）」表示。</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

1986 年的尼加拉瓜案，這是國際法庭（International Court of Justice, ICJ）的一個重要案例，也許能回答你的問題。</p><p>「【Israel’s claim of self-defense in the recent conflict is evocative of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), a previous dispute over international law that was decided by the ICJ in 1968. During the Nicaraguan Contra War, the Fuerza Democratic Nicaraguense (FDN) and the Alianza Revolucionaria Democratic (ARDE), assisted by U.S.-backed contras groups, enacted violence against the new government of Nicaragua. When the Marxist Sandinistas took power following the Nicaraguan revolution, the U.S. supported the contras in rising against the new government, seeking to curb the spread of communism in Latin America. Nicaragua subsequently claimed that the United States was threatening to overthrow its government, to which the U.S. responded that the attacks occurred for self-defense purposes. [5] To reach a decision, the ICJ first consulted Article 51 of the UN Charter, from which it found that Nicaragua had not committed an 「armed attack」 against the United States. This, according to the Court, rendered the U.S. ineligible to claim the right to self-defense. Ultimately, the Court ruled in favor of Nicaragua, finding that the US committed several international law violations, in particular, violating the sovereignty of Nicaragua. The ICJ concluded that the US was 「in breach of its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another State.」 】這段。</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.culawreview.org/journal/the-self-defense-principle-re-examined-the-israel-palestine-conflict-in-international-law">https://www.culawreview.org/journal/the-self-defense-principle-re-examined-the-israel-palestine-conflict-in-international-law</a></p><p></p><p>@*羽</p><p>尼加拉瓜訴美國案和當前的巴以衝突有一個很大的區別在於：在美國向尼加拉瓜港口布設水雷之前，尼加拉瓜並沒有對美國進行任何武力攻擊，這也是 ICJ 判斷美國無權行使美方所聲稱的自衞權的根本依據。但是在這次衝突中，哈馬斯武裝人員無可置疑地發動了武裝襲擊。因此，尼加拉瓜訴美國案的判例對現階段巴以衝突的適用性我個人認為是非常有限的。當然，尼加拉瓜訴美國案判例對規範「自衞權」的概念是有很大積極意義的：一國不能以「對方有‘侵略傾向’」為藉口對實際上未發生的武裝攻擊「提前行使」自衞權。</p><p></p><p>@*自決</p><p>你從哪裏聽到的報道是以色列巴勒斯坦戰爭？難道不是 Israel-Hamas war? 這幾篇新聞標題都清楚的寫着 Israel-Hamas War</p><p>相關鏈接：</p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/2/israel-hamas-war-live-195-killed-120-missing-in-jabalia-strikes">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/2/israel-hamas-war-live-195-killed-120-missing-in-jabalia-strikes</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-11-01-23/index.html">https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-11-01-23/index.html</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/israel-hamas-war-idf-releases-video-shows-forces-enter-gaza/videoshow/104908635.cm">https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/israel-hamas-war-idf-releases-video-shows-forces-enter-gaza/videoshow/104908635.cm</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war">https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/02/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news">https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/02/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news</a></p></li></ul><p>War 是什麼意思?</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/war">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/war</a></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>以上討論整理自「行動行動」發起的針對巴以問題慢討論。</p><p>行動誤差，必有遺漏。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/9a7852ae-0299-4d35-9f05-c84407c437f9.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>入羣添加</figcaption></figure><p><strong>「行動行動」討論羣基於以下規則（詳細規則見羣內）：</strong></p><ul><li><p>表述完整，拒絕短句連發。</p></li><li><p>消息源介紹，引用段落或截圖。</p></li><li><p>反駁時引用對方發言，或簡短反問。</p></li><li><p>不求即時迴應，剋制倫理衝動。</p></li><li><p>不求信息完全精確，但請表述清晰。</p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Day 3，11 月 3 日議題：</strong></p><p>聯合國祕書長古特雷斯説：「哈馬斯襲擊並非憑空發生」。提問：具體應該如何把這個事件放在一個更長的歷史座標中和更寬的國際背景中去理解？放在多大的歷史背景裏看最合適？最近 15 年以色列右傾化的期間？75 年前聯合國分治決議以色列建國？從奧斯曼帝國開始看？還是有其他方式？</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://news.un.org/zh/story/2023/10/1123462">https://news.un.org/zh/story/2023/10/1123462</a></p>

                <![CDATA[<p>前段時間在 YouTube 收看過不少煮食影片。可能就此給 YouTube 的人工智能掌握了我的興趣，於是三不五時就會推薦更多烹飪頻道給我。而「廚職背遊樑子玲」，就是其中一個推薦給我的烹飪頻道。</p><p>起初覺得這個頻道的名字怪怪的。也是因着這一點點的好奇，點進了其中一枝烹飪影片。看完之後就真的不得了，無論是煮食、旅行，還是專訪，都一枝一枝影片看下去，越看越喜歡了。</p><p>樑子玲，一個八零後女生。大學時修讀新聞系，後前往英國留學，修讀媒體管理碩士課程。在留學期間還揹包旅行了十多個國家。現居英國任職廚師，夢想是在英國開設一家餐廳。</p><p>因着她的揹包旅行經歷，她曾為《蘋果日報》的旅遊專欄供稿，也有替《蘋果日報》訪問在英港人，探討他們對大量港人移民英國的看法。</p><p>「廚職背遊樑子玲」這個頻道的誕生，正是因為《蘋果日報》的被迫結業。樑子玲憑著自己擔任廚師的技能，以及揹包旅行的經歷充實了頻道的內容，也藉著這些內容，幫助了剛剛移英的香港人，也鼓勵了仍然留在香港的香港人。</p><p>頻道的節目大致上分為三大類。第一類是煮食系列，分享在英國購買各類食材煮出港式餸菜和餐點的技巧。第二類是背遊系列，介紹英國、法國等地的有趣景點；第三類則是發掘其他海外港人的故事進行報導。我最喜歡她的烹飪系列，不但能買菜學英文，還能啟發我更多煮食靈感。例如我很愛吃港式菠蘿包。但總覺得坊間的食譜做起來很費時。樑子玲示範以組合半成品（曲奇麵團和餐包麵團），的方法製作菠蘿包，甚至用曲奇麵團與已烤熟餐包的組合，快速做好菠蘿包。由於我每星期都會做十多個餐包給自己與家人做早餐。有了這樣的方法，我想自己做個菠蘿包現烤現吃就方便多了。只要預先做好曲奇麵團放在冷凍庫，什麼時候想吃個菠蘿包，挖一小球曲奇麵團壓扁蓋上現成餐包，再放進烤箱烤一下就有新鮮熱剌的懶人菠蘿包吃了。多麼美好呢！</p><p>無論是烹飪、背遊，抑或與移英港人的訪談，只要留心，觀眾不難在最平凡，最不起眼的內容中發現彩蛋。例如在以下這枝烹飪影片的最後，我聽到這番話：</p><p>「凝聚力量的方法很多。可以透過煮食、足球、音樂。也可以是大家一起就地取材。無論身處何方，都繼續做自己相信的事情。」</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esGwt_35yuA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esGwt_35yuA</a></p><p>命運這東西很奇妙，祂會把人帶到自己當初想都沒想過的地方。樑子玲留學與背遊期間由於積蓄有限，不得不邊讀書/旅行邊工作。而在歐洲讀書或旅行，最容易找到的工作就是廚師。樑子玲憑著看影片學到的烹飪本領，以及留學期間自家煮食的經驗，讓她獲得廚師的工作。也正因為廚師的工作，令她後來能製作很多分享在英國超市買食材做港式菜的影片。這些影片對於剛到英國的香港人，提供了非常實質的幫助。</p><p>看樑子玲的影片令我對個體與時代，有了更深入的思考。樑子玲的經歷，是屬於她自己的，但同時也與這個香港人大離散的時代緊密地結連。曾聽説時代的一粒灰塵跌在一個人的頭上，有如一座大山。但我們又怎能肯定個體之於時代，不能成為舉足興訟的那個板塊呢？</p>

2022 年第 5 期。</p></blockquote><p>作者&nbsp;/&nbsp;李晉</p><h2>01</h2><p>二十世紀上半葉的中國邊疆有兩個伍尓辛。弗雷德裏克·伍尓辛是探險家和動物學研究者，曾經代表哈佛大學和國家地理學會兩次訪問中國。在這些考察裏，陪伴他的是他的妻子珍妮·伍尓辛，一個在紐約長大的鐵路大亨的女兒。1980 年，哈佛的皮博迪博物館出版了弗雷德裏克對兩次考察的記錄，但是直到 2003 年我們才看到珍妮的文字和照片。在這本《消失的王國》裏，珍妮·伍尓辛的信件和照片把我們帶回到卓尼、定遠營等已經消失的邊疆政權。這批史料讓我們有機會從女性視角重新思考西方博物學與中國的遭遇。</p><figure class="image"><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>《消失的王國》封面。圖源：作者</p><p>十九世紀，在中國推動博物學發展的歐洲使節和官員基本是男性。利用工作的閒暇時間，這些人在通商口岸周圍探索中國的自然和物種，研究中國的語言和歷史，像人類學家那樣記錄中國的社會和生活。但是我們很少聽説這些人的妻子有類似的愛好。探險與考察所需要的勇敢與毅力，似乎總是與男性綁定在一起。人們相信男性比女性更能忍受惡劣的自然環境和條件，更能承受異域文化和疾病的衝擊。他們會強調這樣一個事實：在全世界收集動植物標本和人類種族資料的基本是男性，他們僱傭的幫手也大多是男性。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/cf64c36e-6f99-4a83-a861-c3d623d9aa23.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>Janet Elliott Wulsin，1921。圖源：作者</figcaption></figure><p><strong>但是，女性很可能只是由於殖民制度的限制才沒能參與博物學知識的生產。</strong>很多歐洲國家一直到十九世紀中後期都不允許女性到殖民地去謀生，它們擔心女性的大量出現將有損歐洲文明在全世界的強健形象，還有種擔心是如果有大量妻子跟着丈夫到海外，這些家庭將因為開銷的增加而要求補助，否則就會因為陷入赤貧而轉向對布爾什維克的認同，這兩種情況都將增加殖民政府在治理上的負擔和難度。因此在很長一段時間，一些國家只允許單身男性到海外殖民地去淘金，由此造成的是人口性別比例在母國的失衡。1911 年，英國女性人口比男性多了一百三十萬，為了避免多出來的女性無法找到配偶，歐洲各國放鬆了對女性流動的管制。</p><p>人們期待走出去的女性能繼續在新定居的土地上按照歐洲標準操持家務，保證丈夫和孩子能繼續保有對母國文化的認同。在這個白人家庭觀的統治下，跨種族的親密關係成為禁忌，與土著有染的殖民官員必須要離職，白人妻子因此被視為維護種族邊界的最保守的勢力。喬治·奧威爾通過一個叫伊麗莎白的女人在自己的《緬甸歲月》裏展示了這套話語的影響。在他的書裏，這個角色沒有任何財產和謀生的技能，在母親死後到緬甸投奔親戚。她厭惡緬甸的文化和市集，厭惡緬甸女性的長相和身體。為此，她拒絕了一個與緬甸人有染的開明軍官的追求，選擇嫁給年長的行政署長作太太。奧威爾批判了這個白人太太羣體和她們創造的封閉的圈子：「與生俱來的冷漠刻毒越來越彰顯，僕人們都很怕她（伊麗莎白）。她總是舉辦令人陶醉的晚宴，知道如何接待下屬官員的老婆……。」但是，這套話語在某種程度上把殖民者的妻子當做體系的替罪羊，用她們來解釋殖民體系與地方社會的脫節。有個説法是一旦有了這些女性，她們的丈夫就必須築起高牆來保證她們過得舒適，避免她們在土著人的怒火下遭到強暴。男性官員因此無法拉近與當地人的距離。這套污名化的説法暗示着在海外生活的女性很可能無法像男性那樣，自由地探索身邊那些她們或許會感興趣的世界。</p><figure

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>喬治奧威爾《緬甸歲月》。圖源：作者</figcaption></figure><p>珍妮·伍爾辛的故事有可能給我們歷史的另一個版本，她的丈夫是探險家和動物學研究者，她必須跟着他在中國的民族地區考察。這種流動對一個白人女性意味着什麼？在旅行中，她對現代科學是否做出了我們不知道的貢獻？重估一個妻子在現代博物學事業中的作用將關係到對權力關係的反思和揭示：博物學事業之所以與男性形象綁定在一起，是否只是因為當時的社會環境把女性侷限在家庭之內？這種權力批判可以導向一個更大的女性主義框架：一旦我們有機會證明白人女性在考察中不是被動的旁觀者，那麼她們是否有機會在遭遇第三世界女性的同時，從對方身上意識到她們作為女性的共同身份？</p><h2>02</h2><p>珍妮·伍尓辛的成長環境看上去和探險沒有任何關聯。她在紐約和波士頓的富人區長大，從小受到的教育的是女人應該以家業為重。她的父親掌管着整個新英格蘭的鐵路，或許是童年時經常從列車上遠眺窗外的景色，少女時代的她想要逃離自己成長的圈子。二十三歲那一年，她在舞會上遇到了哈佛工程系畢業的弗雷德裏克，珍妮的生命裏還從未遇到這樣一個人，想要以動物學和人類學為志業，而且已經為哈佛的動物學博物館在東非收集了一年的標本。兩個年輕人很快墮入愛河。一戰爆發後，弗雷德裏克報名參軍，隨後被派往比利時的前線。為了更靠近自己的愛人，珍妮在美國紅十字會的招募下到巴黎做了護士。</p><p>弗雷德裏克的媽媽是一位活躍在巴黎文化界的女士。在巴黎，她引導珍妮接觸最前沿的文學和戲劇，在知識界和報界的沙龍上汲取養分。這個圈子取代了原生家庭對珍妮的影響，但是她和弗雷德裏克的婚姻並沒有逃過階層的鴻溝。為了討好珍妮的爸爸，弗雷德裏克在戰後加入一家美國公司做財務，但是隻堅持了一年，他就意識到自己無法放棄探險的夢想。一九二一年，哈佛大學詢問弗雷德裏克是否願意再次接受動物博物館的委託到中國蒐集標本。美國經濟在當時已經有蕭條的徵兆，珍妮的爸爸希望弗雷德裏克能利用這個機會幫家族開拓海外市場。他幫助弗雷德裏克拿到了包括國務卿在內的十一封有分量的推薦信。弗雷德裏克和珍妮做了兩個月的準備。他們從西雅圖出發，乘船經日本和馬尼拉到上海，登上前往北平的列車。</p><p>到達北平時，弗雷德裏克已經放棄了經商的打算。當時的北平有一個外國人的圈子，裏面不乏暴得大名的動植物考察者，這些堅定了弗雷德裏克從事考察的決心。他和珍妮在北平組建了一支隊伍，兩個人帶隊從太原、忻州、大同到塞北的呼和浩特，一路搜尋稀有的哺乳動物和鳥類。弗雷德裏克在山西染上了瘧疾。接下來的半年，他只能派助手繼續到江南蒐集標本，自己在北京的水磨衚衕養病。他的隊伍最終找到了揚子鱷、白鰭豚和其他一些稀有鳥類和蛙類的標本，幫助哈佛學者完善了他們對中國和蒙古動物的認識。只用了一年的時間，伍尓辛夫婦就建立了自己在圈子裏的名聲。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/e2196f79-0738-40f3-b852-f79296780177.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>The first expedition。圖源：作者</figcaption></figure><p>一九二二年五月，弗雷德裏克回到美國養病。他告訴岳父自己沒有在中國找到商機，但是看到了一條通過學術攀升的通道。他認為中國的少數民族遲早會引起學界的興趣，如果能利用搜集標本的機會研究這些民族，他有信心在哈佛找到一份工作，然後利用自己在中國的人脈涉足政壇。不管有沒有説服自己的岳父，弗雷德裏克説服了國家地理學會的主席。他和珍妮將得到一筆兩年的資助，這一次他們以考察中國少數民族為目標。</p><p></p><h2>03</h2><p>一九二三年，伍尓辛夫婦在北平組建起新的隊伍。起初他們想要去貴州，但是最終選擇了相對安定的西北。兩個人的朋友裏有不少曾訪問過西北，他們都認為這不會是場一帆風順的旅行。當時最瞭解西北的是在戈壁灘發現恐龍蛋化石的安得思。安得思的夫人告訴珍妮，自己在安得思考察時就待在北平，而且她也從來沒聽説過有哪個女人會跟着丈夫去邊疆。這讓珍妮更不想離開自己在北平的圈子，她覺得這個圈子很像她曾經生活過的巴黎，她也非常喜歡北平這座城市在精神層面給她的刺激。上次來中國，她最喜歡的就是用古董店淘來的傢俱、絲綢、毛毯、字畫佈置自己在水磨衚衕的小家。這讓她意識到自己想要的不是風餐露宿的冒險。漂泊對她而言，可能更像是尋找一個足夠舒適的可以稱之為家的地方。</p><p>這個家裏不能沒有弗雷德裏克，她的丈夫，所以珍妮選擇了犧牲。她剪短了頭髮，在寫給父母的信裏，她説你們精心培養的女兒已經「永遠地死了」，鏡子裏的短髮女人要成為「草原上的野花」。考察隊先到達包頭。從那裏，他們穿過騰格裏沙漠到蘭州，然後從蘭州到更遠的西寧和藏區。弗雷德裏克和珍妮會平安度過路上的每一道劫難，不僅包括沙塵暴、劫匪和斷水，還包括削弱人意志的鴉片。每隔一段時間，他們就要挑一個地方休整。不管是巴彥浩特的定遠營旗府，蘭州城種滿罌粟的小樓，還是卓尼土司撥給他們的木屋，在每一個這樣的地方，珍妮總是堅持用自己挑選的傢俱裝飾它們，打造出生活的儀式感和家的氛圍。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/7a2e22b7-8f41-49cb-bc9b-20415ba50fe8.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>The second expedition。圖源：作者</figcaption></figure><p>但是像絕大多數丈夫，弗雷德裏克忽略了珍妮的感受。他總是焦慮於工作，焦慮於自己能否控制住考察的預算，能否滿足國家地理學會對照片和標本的期待。那個年代的考察者為了大機構的合同面臨激烈的競爭。在他們出發前，國家地理學會答應弗雷德裏克要在二月和三月的雜誌裏宣傳這次考察，但是一直等到八月，他們都沒有看到文字。弗雷德裏克寫給國家地理學會的報告一直沒有收到回信，他寄出去的禮物也沒有消息。在甘南，考察隊收到了一份哈佛寄出的冊子，裏面提到了所有在中國考察的美國探險隊，唯獨沒有提到他們。弗雷德裏克萬分沮喪，覺得自己已經被遺忘。珍妮只有在與親友通信時才敢吐露對丈夫的擔憂。她相信丈夫只是由於運氣不好才沒有爆炸性的發現，而且她覺得弗雷德裏克不像安得思或洛克那樣善於炒作自己。在寫給《國家地理雜誌》的文章裏，洛克宣稱自己最早拍攝了卓尼的羌姆法會，但是他到卓尼的時間實際上晚於弗雷德裏克和珍妮。為了增加弗雷德裏克的曝光度，珍妮甚至寫信給家人，希望他們能利用在紐約和華盛頓的關係施加些影響。</p><p><strong>讓人驚訝的是，即使已經做出如此巨大的妥協和犧牲，珍妮還是會擔心拖丈夫的後腿。</strong>她在寫給母親的信裏提道：「弗雷德裏克熱愛他的工作，熱愛中國和他研究的問題。他的想法已經開始像個學者……但是問題在於我。這種生活雖然很有趣，可是我不想永遠這樣過。」她不想讓兩人的婚姻失去共同語言，但是在家務之外又找不到幫助丈夫的辦法：「愛一個人卻不能給他想要的東西是件悲傷的事情」，她告訴婆婆。這些不時出現的自責展示了珍妮·伍尓辛矛盾的一面。她選擇探險家做丈夫，選擇保有對未知世界的憧憬；但是當她真地有機會面對那個世界，她又多少因為對丈夫的關注而辜負了這場邂逅。一些女性主義學者或許會感到惋惜，如果珍妮·伍尓辛能再勇敢一點兒，她或許能對世界博物學有更大的貢獻。</p><h2>04</h2><p>不管怎樣，珍妮·伍尓辛證明女性完全有可能顛覆我們對博物學事業的想象。<strong>雖然她的丈夫抱怨「在隊伍裏帶一個女人相當於帶四個男人」，但是珍妮在隊伍中承擔着具體而關鍵的任務。她負責隊伍的聯絡和財務，負責標本的整理和運輸。在必要時，她像男隊員一樣抓蛇、打野豬、給駝隊打包。弗雷德裏克在接受國家地理學會的資助後開始學習攝影，他把照片沖洗和放大的任務交給了珍妮。在路上，珍妮用臨時搭建的暗房沖洗了數千張底片。她還利用自己當護士的經驗保障了隊伍的健康。</strong>通過行醫和贈藥，她幫助隊伍贏得了地方社會的好感，很多標本實際上來自於前來看病的農夫和獵人。這些細節都證明女性可以像男性一樣影響博物學知識的生產，歷史上一定有很多女性用我們不知道的方式推動了十九和二十世紀的考察。</p><p>或許，我們越是在歷史上尋找女性考察者的身影和聲音，就越有可能發現圍繞在她們身邊的規訓與權力。與同時代的很多女性相比，珍妮·伍尓辛沒有在從小的耳濡目染中滑向對男權政治的順從，相反，她獨特的人生軌跡和婚姻證明，這是個想要掌控自己生活的女性。但是珍妮·伍尓辛還是掉進了由丈夫製造出的漩渦：他把她帶到中國，又不給她想要的中國，在矛盾中，她只能選擇妥協和犧牲。珍妮·伍爾辛讓我們看到了女性主體性複雜的一面。當不平等的性別實踐和不公正的家庭關係塑造了女人對愛的意識，她們在想要突破時也可能撞向權力的樊籠。作為能動者的女性與作為受害者的女性之間並沒有清晰的界限，看似自由的選擇有可能是對權力關係的複製和確認。</p><p>我們或許可以從這種搖擺來理解珍妮·伍尓辛與邊疆女性的互動。無論是在正式的社交場合還是路上的偶遇，珍妮特別喜歡在信裏講述這些互動。在談到藏族女孩兒如何調侃弗雷德裏克的相貌時，她説她們「美麗」而「直接」。在談到自己如何與蒙古女性交流對首飾、針線包和辮子的看法時，她説這是「所有女人的共同語言」。珍妮·伍尓辛無疑對女性的共同身份有一種模糊的自覺，這也解釋了她為什麼非常在意中國女性的煙癮、纏足、惡劣的衞生條件，以及年長女性與年輕女性之間的等級關係。像後殖民研究者指出的，在海外旅行的白人女性比男性更容易注意到不平等的社會制度如何限制了當地女性的發展。但是我們不知道當珍妮·伍尓辛哀嘆中國邊疆女性的境遇時，她是否通過把自己放到一個觀察者的位置，暫時忘記了類似的權力機制也通過不平等的婚姻關係限制了她這個白人女性的自由。</p><p>珍妮·伍尓辛的故事突出了性別不平等對理解殖民世界的意義。受後殖民思潮的影響，當學者們批判西方殖民者如何用強勢話語屏蔽底層的聲音時，他們往往忽略了在統治者內部同樣存在着分化。任何想要從性別角度批判殖民主義的學者，都需要意識到白人女性同樣有可能像土著女性那樣在殖民體系裏處於受害者的位置。歐洲女性在很長一段時間被剝奪了進出殖民地的自由。在可以參與對殖民地的建設後，她們也被歸入殖民秩序最糟糕的一面，彷彿在沒有她們幹擾的情況下，男性殖民者可以更好地達成與地方社會的和解，實現殖民勢力作為啓蒙者的一面。與同時代的很多女性相比，珍妮·伍尓辛無疑擁有更大的自由。但是當她擁有的階層優勢在萬裏之外的中國被稀釋時，她讓我們更清楚地看到即使是出身上層的女孩兒，在作為單獨個體時也要屈從於男性主導的婚姻關係。</p><h2><strong>最新文章（持續更新）</strong></h2><ol

            </title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<blockquote><h3><strong>哈馬斯殺平民對自己的好處是什麼？</strong></h3></blockquote><p>​@王*海</p><p>如果哈馬斯真的想打完江山，坐江山的話，對於平民，外國公民來説哈馬斯應該秋毫無犯的，他需要國際社會的承認，支持。</p><p></p><p>@Spring*</p><p>哈馬斯攻擊平民的目的是通過殺死平民，製造以色列社會混亂，增加以色列維持現狀的統治成本。讓以色列意識到如果繼續維持現狀是「虧」的，從未主動嘗試完全或部分滿足哈馬斯的要求。攻擊外國人也是同理，外國人會給以色列帶來外交和旅遊業上的壓力。（當然我認為哈馬斯這樣做可能並不成功，他們的訴求過於激進反而導致以色列不會退讓）綜上，屠殺並不是單純的報復，核心目的在於製造以色列的社會動盪和恐慌。</p><p></p><p>@Je*</p><ol><li><p>哈馬斯不是一個精密的儀器。最底層的造成屠殺的武裝人員和哈馬斯作為一個組織完全是兩個羣體。政治目標比較明確的哈馬斯領導和可能一心想要報仇的武裝人員出現不一致應該是可以理解的。而且音樂節是臨時選擇了邊界附近作為地點（wiki 上有），應該是上層領導沒有預料到的。</p></li><li><p>哈馬斯方面對於這個屠殺的解釋也一直在變。先是説是士兵，又説是加沙民眾自發屠殺，之後又改口稱根本沒有大屠殺。哈馬斯對於這個的迴應不像是提前預計好了的。</p></li></ol><p>由此，我認為音樂節屠殺更有可能是基層武裝人員暴走的結果。完善的現代國家的士兵是否能在戰爭中遵守國際法尚且存疑，那哈馬斯這樣的運動沒有能力約束其士兵在軍事行動中的戰爭罪行為應該是合理的。</p><p></p><p>@這*</p><p>要引起國際社會對巴以問題的關注，從結果來看，他們達到了。哈馬斯這次是抱着最後一次的想法搞得這個行動，上去的都是哈馬斯的精鋭，去的時候也沒打算回來，這次之後也打算撤出加沙。</p><p></p><p>@薛定諤*</p><p>我在這裏再做一個對問題本身的疑問。在整體的 10.7 日行動中，我們可以看到哈馬斯是相對有過準備和充分訓練的。比如第一波火箭彈和步兵的配合，工兵對邊境牆的破障，滑翔傘部隊等等。基於這樣的假設，我認為哈馬斯對自己行動可能產生的國際社會反應是有預計的。因此在這裏，我想反過來問：殺死或不殺死在音樂節現場的他國平民，真的會有什麼影響嗎？或者説，在（從他們的視角看來）受到長期封鎖和國際無視的前提下，一次上千人規模都襲擊真的有可能只是為了引起國際關注嗎？國際觀瞻對他們來説有何意義。在這個基礎上再進一步，襲擊音樂會是一個媒體事件，和大多數國家核心利益無關，本身也很難影響國家層面在巴以問題上的站隊。</p><p></p><p>@總有事*</p><p>可是哈馬斯做的不僅僅是殺死平民，他還把遇難者綁在皮卡上游街示眾，將殺害遇難者的流程拍下來發給他們的親人（Soon after the attack, a video began circulating widely on social media, showing the body of a young woman being paraded through the streets in the back of a flatbed truck, surrounded by armed fighters and others yelling "Allahu Akbar" . )&nbsp;</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

75% 的資金來自海外捐贈，所以他們做的越極端，引起注意越大，他們的捐助越多，哈的頭領大多人在海外，或資產在海外，去幹活兒的是一些年輕人，所以這種大屠殺是符合哈馬斯的利益的，或哈馬斯高層的利益。</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

class="smart"></p><blockquote><h3><strong>哈馬斯的襲擊是以色列的持久壓迫造成的嗎？</strong></h3></blockquote><p>@總有事*</p><p>以色列對加沙的壓迫是事實，但我不認為哈馬斯是以色列壓迫造就的產物。從以色列建國第二天就有阿拉伯聯軍意圖摧毀這個國家（1948 巴勒斯坦戰爭），到 2006 年哈馬斯以繼續巴勒斯坦抵抗運動贏得大多數席位（這場選舉只有約旦河西岸，加沙，東巴勒斯坦的一百三十萬巴勒斯坦人有投票權；擁有以色列國籍或是流亡在海外的巴勒斯坦人被拒絕投票）。他們的衝突其實就是以色列與不願意承認以色列生存地位的穆斯林的衝突，沒有哪方是單純的壓迫者或被壓迫者。</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer

2017 年的最新綱領，其中明確提出哈馬斯承認 1967 年的巴以控制線，網上很多人説哈馬斯要求徹底消滅以色列，至少從這個文件上來看，是不成立的</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

*</p><p>同樣的，在之前多次未果的聯合國安全理事會有關巴以問題的會議中，衝突的焦點也在於是否認為哈馬斯是否是恐怖組織，以及以色列後續的行為是否可以認為是自衞權。阿拉伯世界在近期的國際會議中也通常被認為與哈馬斯的極端行為割席，但是他們依舊反對以色列對加沙地區的非法侵佔。在最接近投票通過的、安理會有關巴以問題的決議中，各方也認為哈馬斯為恐怖組織，但這不能成為無限無差別反擊的理由。聯合國安全理事會對巴西提案的新聞稿：「決議草案堅決譴責一切針對平民的暴力和敵對行動以及一切恐怖主義行為，明確反對並譴責哈馬斯自 2023 年 10 月 7 日開始在以色列境內實施的令人髮指的恐怖主義襲擊以及劫持人質行為，呼籲立即無條件釋放所有人質，要求遵照國際法保障他們的安全、福祉和人道待遇。」</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

年綱領的大部分內容都在講巴勒斯坦是屬於穆斯林的土地，要猶太人滾出巴勒斯坦。並且他們的行為也不像綱領説的那樣 (Hamas believes that the message of Islam upholds the values of truth, justice, freedom and dignity and prohibits all forms of injustice and incriminates oppressors irrespective of their religion, race, gender or nationality. )</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

*</p><p>聯繫到第一次中東戰爭前的那段波折那麼衝突的核心又回到了以色列建國的合法性。畢竟憑空摳掉巴勒斯坦人接近一半的土地很難讓當地人平靜接受。以色列在阿拉伯人有意見的情況下建國的行為又是否是阿拉伯抵抗運動的根源？</p><p></p><p>@路易*十八</p><p>我認為這過於簡單化了這幾十年的變化。如果看到近幾次中國大使的發言，會注意到他反覆提到一個現實和直接的衝突原因，是「兩國方案不能落實」。到了第三次中東戰爭以後，以色列在中東的生存環境已經大大緩和了。和平的可能性是存在的，哈馬斯也不是最能代表巴勒斯坦人民的組織，可是巴解等支持兩國方案的努力也沒有得到以色列方面的善意。</p><p><strong><br class="smart"></strong></p><blockquote><h3><strong>哈馬斯到底是不是恐怖組織？</strong></h3></blockquote><p>@薛定諤*</p><p>簡單翻了一下聊天記錄，看到大家圍繞哈馬斯是否是恐怖主義有一些討論。我個人對這一討論沒有什麼個人立場，但對討論這個問題的羣友，想做一個簡單的提醒。「恐怖主義」的話語，本身有複雜的歷史背景。其指認也是被不同時代的權力所形塑的。一些早期的安那其運動可被視作恐怖主義，赤軍、紅軍旅也可以，1515 也可以，但它們的運作邏輯，訴求完全不同。而哈馬斯和以上這些組織也相當不同，至少在我瞭解範圍內，他們承擔了一部分加沙的基層治理工作，本身也作為政黨參加了巴勒斯坦的選舉。簡單來説，抵達「哈馬斯是/不是恐怖分子」只是一個起點。有很多問題值得問。不要止步於概念本身。</p><p></p><p>@天空*下</p><p>我粗略地想，只要是不尊重人生命的，就不為國際所容，而形態不限於恐怖主義，緬甸軍政府鎮壓人民。似乎恐怖主義指在和平社會內部製造襲擊，哈馬斯這是對外殘殺對內高壓統治，也許不太一樣。但總之，我覺得哈馬斯被國際社會視為敵人沒問題。</p><p></p><p>@Ada *</p><p>以下摘自百度百科：哈馬斯是巴勒斯坦一個宗教性的政治組織，反對同以色列和談，並且不放棄以武力消滅以色列，並將巴勒斯坦人對以色列的攻擊行動稱為「聖戰」，從而建立由地中海到約旦河西岸、並以耶路撒冷為首都的巴勒斯坦國。值得注意的是哈馬斯有自己的宗教性，哈馬斯作為非常極端的組織的主要目標就是「將以色列清除」。他們極有可能將所有非本教的民眾認為是「異教徒」，進而將暴力行為正當化為所謂「聖戰」，那麼從這個角度講無條件不分國籍傷害平民也就有了一定依據。</p><p></p><p>@這*</p><p>抵抗組織的關鍵在於抵抗，如果沒有壓迫就沒有抵抗，如果以色列沒有壓迫巴勒斯坦斯坦，哈馬斯會不會繼續攻擊以色列，這就是他是不是抵抗組織的關鍵。至少哈馬斯的 88 年閒章表面他的目的是徹底消滅以色列，並拒絕任何和談手段，至少從他建立時的目的來看不算抵抗組織。不過 17 年他修改過自己的綱領，所以現在很難判定。</p><p></p><p>@盧*博</p><p>從哈馬斯 2017 的最新綱領看，他們已經不再堅持消滅以色列，而是轉向接受 1967 兩國方案，百科的説法我覺得不準確。</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank"

年的這篇綱領，裏面提到的以色列都是加了引號的，哈馬斯聲稱自己不反對猶太教和猶太人，他們反對錫安主義及其政權，但同時確實也明確了認同 1967 年 6 月 4 日的邊界。按這個綱領推演的話，即使兩國方案實現，以色列也只會成為哈馬斯一個不得不承認其存在的可惡的鄰居，兩國之間也只能是停火而不會是和平。</p><figure class="image"><img

However, without compromising its rejection of the Zionist entity and without relinquishing any Palestinian rights, Hamas considers the establishment of a fully sovereign and independent Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital along the lines of the 4th of June 1967, with the return of the refugees and the displaced to their homes from which they were expelled, to be a formula of national consensus.</p><p></p><p>@Ada *</p><p>我個人認為抵抗組織和恐怖組織並不是互斥的，抵抗出於目的或是來由，而恐怖來自於行動。聯合國大會第十屆緊急特別會議所形成的文件也提到了反對雙方的一切恐怖主義行為和針對平民的無差別暴力。所以他既可以是抵抗組織同樣也可以是恐怖主義行為的實行方。聯合國大會新聞稿：「決議呼籲撤銷佔領國以色列的撤離令，堅決反對任何強行遷移巴勒斯坦平民的企圖。決議譴責所有針對巴勒斯坦和以色列平民的暴力行為，包括一切恐怖主義行為和無差別攻擊，以及一切挑釁、煽動和毀壞行為，呼籲立即實行持久和持續的人道主義休戰，從而促成停止敵對行動。」</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://news.un.org/zh/story/2017/12/312022#:~:text=%E8%81%94%E5%90%88%E5%9B%BD%E5%A4%A7%E4%BC%9A12%E6%9C%88,%EF%BC%8C%E5%BF%85%E9%A1%BB%E4%BA%88%E4%BB%A5%E6%92%A4%E9%94%80%E3%80%82">https://news.un.org/zh/story/2017/12/312022#:~:text=%E8%81%94%E5%90%88%E5%9B%BD%E5%A4%A7%E4%BC%9A12%E6%9C%88,%EF%BC%8C%E5%BF%85%E9%A1%BB%E4%BA%88%E4%BB%A5%E6%92%A4%E9%94%80%E3%80%82</a></p><p>聯合國大會有關巴以問題的 A/ES-10/L.25 文件全文：</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://daccess-ods.un.org/tmp/249533.802270889.html">https://daccess-ods.un.org/tmp/249533.802270889.html</a></p><p></p><p>@王*海</p><p>首先我們需要先明確什麼是抵抗組織，什麼是恐怖組織。我個人覺得區別在於採取暴力行為的針對對象。抵抗組織，比如二戰時期的德佔區的抵抗組織，主要攻擊目標是德國佔領當局或者與德國合作的當地政府、軍事機構以及設施。比如貨運站、電廠、碼頭、營房、倉庫等。恐怖組織，則是對所有他們認為是敵人的人員，進行無差別暴力行為。比如一些伊斯蘭極端組織向以色列平民定居點發起的火箭彈甚至人肉炸彈攻擊。我再舉個我們所熟悉的例子，請問東北抗聯是恐怖組織還是抵抗組織？東北抗聯的行動是什麼？扒日本的鐵路，和日本軍隊打遊擊，反掃蕩，請問東北抗聯，又或者抗戰歷史中有抵抗組織對平民下手嗎，有對外國公民下手嗎？有綁架外國平民，要挾對方嗎？我認為，哈馬斯的武裝行為擴大到平民，就已經是不折不扣的恐怖組織了。</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/24472652/answer/27917836">https://www.zhihu.com/question/24472652/answer/27917836</a></p><p></p><p>@拍*</p><p>我統一這個觀點。以下是一些補充：恐怖主義通過襲擊平民、製造大規模傷亡、散播恐懼以間接達成政治目的[1] ，而抵抗運動通常直接攻擊反抗對象。恐怖主義和抵抗運動不是互斥的概念，恐怖主義是一種達成目標的戰術，而抵抗運動描述的是衝突的尺度、對象、和類型[2]。</p><p>相關鏈接：[1]<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A2%AB%E8%AE%A4%E5%AE%9A%E7%9A%84%E6%81%90%E6%80%96%E7%BB%84%E7%BB%87%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8">https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A2%AB%E8%AE%A4%E5%AE%9A%E7%9A%84%E6%81%90%E6%80%96%E7%BB%84%E7%BB%87%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8</a></p><p>[2]<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24758590#:~:text=Terrorism%20is%20a%20tactic.,Neither%20concept%20is%20mutually%20exclusive">https://www.jstor.org/stable/24758590#:~:text=Terrorism%20is%20a%20tactic.,Neither%20concept%20is%20mutually%20exclusive</a>.</p><p></p><p>@Dc*</p><p>美利堅請日本羣眾吃核彈，要挾天皇投降，算不算恐怖行為？</p><p></p><p>@天空*下</p><p>我不太清楚以色列右翼對定居點人欺壓到什麼程度，國內傳言也不是很敢信，見諒。我主張廣島原子彈由於時代侷限不能做現在的標準，但對哈以雙方的標準應該同一，即不能傷害平民。</p><p></p><p>@這*</p><p>關於美國的東京轟炸和核爆，其目的是逼迫日本政府投降，並非要徹底消滅日本人，所以説美國做的是恐怖行為，但美國不是恐怖組織。</p><p></p><p>@拍*</p><p>拉登本身就是衝着平民去的襲擊，和美國對日本的戰爭不一樣，戰爭主要目標是對方的軍事資源，而不是一上來就去攻擊貧民，我也説了，美國後期的戰爭行為是一種恐怖主義行為，然後恐怖分子是個現代觀念，和你説的史書有什麼關係，不太能理解。</p><p></p><p>@薛定諤*</p><p>那我也簡單説一下我傾向於認為哈馬斯是抵抗組織的觀點：武裝抵抗的形式不是從真空中來的，考慮到哈馬斯和 IDF 實際裝備層面的巨大差距，哈馬斯在實現加沙人民反抗過程中的方式方法本身就是極為有限的。我並不是説，不能對哈馬斯組織的行動形式進行辯駁，但不論是從過去數年的襲擊頻次來看，還是從 10.7 日行動之後哈馬斯的動作來看，他們都留有大量的作戰力量。他們還在進行火箭彈襲擊，同時也有餘力給人質提供護手霜。如果他們的目標是針對以色列平民，他們完全可以在短期內 idf 毫無行動的情況下儘可能擴大戰果。在這樣的行動思路下，恐怕以色列當前的平民傷亡數字可以輕鬆翻倍。因此，我們可以説哈馬斯的首要目標不是屠殺平民，或者説，他們殺死平民也並不是為了單純報復，或滅絕以色列人。殺死平民，綁架人質，在我看來，幸運或不幸地，都是一種現代化的，高度軍事理性的決策邏輯下的產物，是一種鬥爭的策略。把它們單純視作出於某種宗教狂熱，精神失常，追求平民傷亡為結果的行動是一種誤判。有另一種觀點認為，只要在作戰過程中，有通過殺傷平民去達到戰爭目的的組織，就可以被定性為恐怖組織。這種觀點在人道主義角度無可指摘，問題就是脫離現實，對實際認識問題沒有幫助，最後只能留下一個精緻的姿態。因為抱有這種觀點的朋友沒有意識到，構成「恐怖組織」這一指認背後的當代話語權力。誠然，美軍、以軍過去都殺傷大量平民，但如果我們要在一個把哈馬斯、美軍、以軍都視作恐怖組織的視角重新看待整個問題，恐怕不僅我們的討論範圍控制不住，也只能討論出一些更換了表述方式的陳詞濫調。至於説區分「抵抗組織純度」的行為，我只能説這樣的思路，出發點和「找完美受害者」沒有任何區別。世界上沒有虛空裏的壓迫和受壓迫的關係，但在具體的事件中，在現實的物質世界中，我們總是能看到強權的一方和弱勢的一方，封鎖的一方和被封鎖的一方。試圖把 1948 年戰爭和 2006 年戰爭中間剪接起來的操作也是可疑的，至少這遮蔽了第二次中東戰爭時期國際社會對英法以的強烈譴責，和對埃及納賽爾的支持。最後，我還是真誠地建議大家，不要在概念的泥潭裏打滾。界定哈馬斯是否是恐怖組織這個問題一點都不重要。它對加沙人民當前的苦難也毫無意義。</p><p></p><p>@薛定諤*</p><p>抱歉，我很難一下子給出非常清晰的信息來源。護手霜這個事情油管上簡單找找都能找到。第二次中東戰爭相關的部分，我認為維基百科足以支持我的論述。其餘關於話語權力的部分，可能來自於戰後歐陸思想的一些基礎共識吧，並沒有什麼特定的來源。</p><p></p><p>@天空*下</p><p>好謝謝，我看看。另外有個意見，我覺得護手霜不能拿來證明哈馬斯總體上善待人質，反例還是更多。退一步它善待了人質，也還是恐怖要挾，不可取。</p><p></p><p>@薛定諤*</p><p>做一個澄清，我這裏引用護手霜的例子，並不是希望證明哈馬斯善待人質，而是意圖説明，在前線態勢相對緊張的情況下，他們一定程度上可以保證物資供應，並且還有餘力去滿足一些人質的特定需求，或者説做一些形象上的努力。</p><p></p><p>@總有事*</p><p>看了篇採訪，解答了今天的疑問。我之前一直忽略了加沙的人們是在一個獨裁政府統治下生活的。「哈馬斯把花錢在修隧道上，而不是投資在人民身上」，一名加沙女子對我説。她現在不得不留在耶路撒冷，因為她的小兒子正在那裏的一家巴勒斯坦醫院接受癌症治療。她説，加沙的絕望情緒如此之大，以至於一些年輕人多年來只夢想當「烈士」，用殺死以色列人來贏得榮譽。「加沙沒有希望」，她説。「沒有生活，我們生活在加沙什麼都沒有。人們唯一能做的就是成為烈士。」</p><p></p><p>@總有事*</p><p>70% 的加沙人都支持加沙由法塔赫接管，哈馬斯為了穩固自己的統治向以色列發起攻擊，從而讓加沙無辜的人們受到了以色列違反人權的轟炸；如果哈馬斯真的為了民族自決而反抗，就不會不聽取加沙人的聲音。Gazan frustration with Hamas governance is clear; most Gazans expressed a preference for PA administration and security officials over Hamas—the majority of Gazans (70%) supported a proposal of the PA sending 「officials and security officers to Gaza to take over the administration there, with Hamas giving up separate armed units, including 47% who strongly agreed.</p><p>相關鏈接：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/polls-show-majority-gazans-were-against-breaking-ceasefire-hamas-and-hezbollah">washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/polls-show-majority-gazans-were-against-breaking-ceasefire-hamas-and-hezbollah</a></p><p><br class="smart"></p><blockquote><h3><strong>以色列的自衞正當嗎？</strong></h3></blockquote><p>@Ada *</p><p>據我觀察是的。在衝突爆發的第一時間大部分國家與民眾都表現出了對以色列遭到突然襲擊的震驚悲傷與對以色列民眾的支持。這部分可詳見全球主流媒體的報道與各地的支持以色列人的集會。但隨後以色列方的無差別反擊與對各類非軍事設施的大規模攻擊使得輿論的天平出現了傾斜，在聯合國大會與聯合國安全理事會的相關國家表態中可見一斑。</p><p></p><p>@爽*</p><p>culr 的文章。從國際法角度看以色列的自衞理論。Thus, when a nation’s military force overrides this collective right to self-determination of a group of people, its actions become a violation of international law. [9] This is evident in Gaza, where Israel’s justification of force has been excessive and has endangered the self-determination of Palestinians, for example, through its hostile occupation of the Gaza Strip. [10] Essentially, for Israel to legitimately makes the claim of self-defense, it must legally ensure the right to self-determination to Palestinian people, by treating Palestine as a separate, sovereign state; in this case, however, Israel is both illegally occupying Palestinian territories such as Gaza and violating Palestinian rights that are guaranteed by ICJ precedent such as Military and Paramilitary Activities.

                <![CDATA[<p>昨晚睡得早，不到 9 點就上牀睡覺了。半夜 11 點多被尿憋醒，看到一道強烈的白光透過窗戶射入我住的房間，閃了一下，就熄滅了。我潛意識裏覺得那不是廚房的燈光，角度不對；也不是廚房旁邊那個小屋子的燈光，顏色不對；因此肯定是有人站在廚房旁邊那間敞開門窗的小屋子前面，用手電筒照我住的屋子。那一刻，照理説我應該感到害怕，然而我還是泰然自若地從牀上爬起來，迷迷糊糊地走到院子裏去上廁所。回屋的時候還在想，沒準剛才用手電筒照我屋子的人此刻就藏在那間小屋裏……管他呢，反正屋裏的東西不值錢。我自己呢，又醜又老又矬，如果碰到劫色的，指不定是誰吃虧呢。</p><p>回到屋裏躺在牀上，怎麼都睡不着。幾隻貓老是想壓着被子邊緣睡覺，或者壓着我的腳睡覺，被子繃得緊緊的，擠壓得我胸口疼，讓我擔心自己會不會突發心臟病，像李克強那樣意外死去。於是隻好不斷地把貓兒們從被子上抖下去。</p><p>感覺這樣迷迷瞪瞪的半失眠狀態持續了很久，我甚至聽到鄰居家的公雞啼鳴，然後才再次入睡。</p><p>睡着之後，我做了兩個夢。</p><p>在第一個夢中，我回到故鄉，和母親以及早在 1980 年代初就已去世的祖母準備參加一場壽宴。非常奇怪的是，我們家的男性——父親以及在 1980 年代末去世的祖父——都沒有在夢中出現。壽宴的主人跟我們家似乎並非密切的親友，只是因為我家欠了她一個人情，接到邀請後不好不去。一開始母親只打算和祖母一起參加，需要隨禮 600 元，如果我也要去，就得再加 200 元。母親有點捨不得多花那 200 塊，偏偏平常不喜歡走親戚的我，這一次特別想去看熱鬧。她還在猶豫，我的乾女兒不知道從哪裏冒出來，説要代我隨那 200 塊的禮，搞得我和母親都不好意思，母親抹不開面子，只好帶上我。祖母一聲不吭地站在屋裏，穿上一條褲腳開敞的白色褲子，有點像 1980 年代的喇叭褲。我笑她穿那褲子好不滑稽，母親卻向我使眼色，讓我不要笑話祖母。</p><p>來到鎮上舉辦壽宴的飯莊，卻發現裏面冷冷清清，並沒有多少人。主人解釋説應邀參加的客人比較少，原來預訂的桌位退掉了好多。不過宴席上的飯菜依然豐盛，在現實生活中因為炊具尚未購全每日靠喝果汁和玉米小米糊糊和掛麪維持生存的我，在夢中大吃了一頓。</p><p>我正抱着一大坨雞肉啃呢，忽然聽到外面一陣喧譁。我的乾女兒告訴我們説戰爭爆發了，有一支軍隊侵入了我們所在的鎮子。大家羣情激憤，紛紛表示要和敵人戰鬥到底。</p><p>但是我們這一方的戰鬥力不夠強，很快就被敵人打得節節敗退，退守到母親孃家所在的村子，敵人卻佔據了村子上方關隘處原本只有一個家族兩三戶人家的小村。敵人在地勢上居高臨下，我們處於非常不利的位置，而且部隊還帶着一大羣由老弱婦孺組成的平民，困守在據點中，與敵人對抗了兩三天，根本無法阻擋敵軍順着村子上面那條公路推進。</p><p>我心急如焚，跑到據點外查看敵軍動向，卻被上方公路上巡邏的敵軍中一個站在車頂上窺視我軍陣地的敵人發現，就在敵人舉槍瞄準我的時候，我趕緊閃到一堵牆後，才躲過了槍子兒。</p><p>回到據點裏，我問指揮官是否還能抽出兵力偷襲敵軍營地，搞他個聲東擊西。指揮官搖搖頭説我們的士兵已經所剩無幾，根本抽不出兵力偷襲，現在只能勉強牽制住敵軍火力，掩護據點裏的平民疏散。</p><p>我準備帶着母親躲到下面一個廢棄的村子裏去。那個地方曾經出現在我以前做的一個夢中，村裏房屋的地面建築已經倒塌，到處是斷壁殘垣，但地下室依然堅固，可以供我們躲藏幾天。</p><p>我和母親慌亂地收拾行李，一會兒忘記帶睡袋了，又或者是忘記帶食物了。匆忙離開據點後，我又想起沒有帶換洗的內衣褲。其實帶了也沒用，那個廢墟里根本找不到水來洗衣服。</p><p>周圍都是流離失所的難民，大家各自四處逃命，能不能躲過這一劫只能看運氣了。</p><p>剛離開據點沒多久，我和母親就遇到了尾隨而至的敵軍。他們不知道從哪裏偷了一輛黑色轎車，在一個非 T 形的三岔路口截住我們。車子從上面那條傾斜的坡道，拐過一個別針彎，朝位於下方公路上的我駛來，我趕緊跨過分隔兩條道路的綠化帶，跑到上面那條公路上。等敵人掉轉車頭，順着上面那條公路追趕我時，我又跨過那條綠化帶，跑到下面的公路上來。幾個回合之後，敵人惱羞成怒，舉起槍就朝我來了一梭子。</p><p>按照常理，此刻的我應該已經被打成篩子，必死無疑了。但作為夢的主人，我在自己的夢中是不會死的。中槍之後，我的身體裏沒有流出鮮血，卻噴出火來。我母親不知道從哪裏弄到一根繩子，衝到敵人跟前，想要將敵人勒死，而我也準備用身體裏噴出來的火將敵人燒死。面對這兩個手無寸鐵卻負隅頑抗的女人，敵人居然有些怯懦了。</p><p>就在這時，我從睡夢中醒來，拿起手機看了看時間，已經是早上 7 點多，我在牀上睡了差不多 11 個小時。</p><p>房子對面的山上，太陽就快出來了，可是夢中那場戰爭在我心裏留下的陰影，依然沒有完全散去。</p><p>昨晚臨睡之前讀一本有關本地地名的書，才知道這個位於深山老林的偏遠小縣，在歷史上有很多居民都是來自外省的移民，為躲避戰亂而來到這裏，有幾個比較富有的家族甚至是從安徽和湖北遷徙而來的。但這些移民的主體似乎來自西南省份，無論是他們的方言還是房屋構造乃至飲食習慣，都跟我老家非常接近。</p><p>原來我並非第一個為躲避（潛在）戰亂而逃進這個深山老林的人。</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>上週末去黃山一趟，參加黃山馬拉松，順便打卡一下名勝古蹟。</p><p>我從未去過安微，但長期被各種圖片中的皖南風光所吸引，這是黃山馬之所以吸引到我目光的主要原因。不然，過去的這個週末，全中國據説有超過 20 場馬拉松同時鳴槍，黃山馬拉松假如沒有黃山這個金字招牌，大概沒幾個人會關注得到。</p><p>果然，比賽不太值得一提，可能考慮到封鎖道路對當地交通的影響，線路安排在交通不便，通常遊客也比較少的黃山北門一帶。北門所在的太平鎮是黃山區政府所在地。這點比較奇怪，不是一般情況下衙門所在地都是各種中心嗎？而黃山的南大門湯口鎮，才是黃山景區的主要入口。那裏距黃山市更近，交通更便利，接待能力也更強，據説黃山遊客超過 90% 都是從南門上山。</p><p>不過，據麪館老闆娘講，北門明年就通高鐵，到時就可以和湯口一爭長短。</p><p>那是跑完五個半小時，從接駁車終點走回酒店的路上路過的一個麪館。我雖然被賽場上的香蕉和能量膠餵了個半飽，肚子不餓，但每次完賽去往酒店的路上，都是一天中最難熬的時光，堪比整個 42.195K。所以我一般只要途中有飯館，就會停下來歇腳，順便吃飯，暫且不管滿身狼狽。</p><p>老闆娘推薦筍乾面加牛肉，我説好，再來瓶迎客松。那是當地啤酒品牌，酒精度只有 2.5 度。老闆娘在裏間煮麪時，從外面進來一個三十多歲的陰鬱男子，徑自走到冰櫃，拿了瓶啤酒，在操作間外面的桌子上坐下來，和我之間有幾張桌子。我和老闆娘隔着玻璃隔斷聊馬拉松時，他一邊刷抖音一邊對瓶吹，始終沒看我一眼，也未插一言。但有次突然擤鼻涕，直接衝着地面，像是馬打了個響鼻。擤完也沒起身洗手，甚至沒用紙擦一擦，繼續刷他的抖音。我心裏一沉，轉念安慰自己，反正也不是他煮的，他看起來連廚房也不會進。然後，他就進了廚房。那時，正好有人打電話，老闆娘走到外邊來接電話，他便在裏邊代替她。看動作，像是撈麪。我幾乎眼前一黑，想要拔腿就跑。可是跑不動，也不知道怎麼跑。於是繼續假裝無事發生（這是中國人最在行的技能）。好在，他後來給自己端了一碗出來吃，我那碗，是再後來老闆娘端出來的。我以為我吃不下，可是幾分鐘後，我連湯都喝了個精光。談不上好吃，大概是身體極度需要碳水。走時我一邊跟老闆娘説謝謝，一邊心想，我要記住這個店，以後再也不要來了。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/932ed9c4-8e2c-4383-b929-8807c3268fe6.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>那碗麪</figcaption></figure><p>不只是這家麪館，大概黃山馬拉松，也就只此一次。它以城市馬拉松之名，行山地馬拉松之實，後來跑進山裏，一些路段坡長彎急，也沒什麼風光可看。我本來打算跑進 5 小時，晚上獎勵自己一個臭鱖魚，結果拼盡全力也就跑了 531，臭鱖魚便沒吃到。</p><p>話説那臭鱖魚，我在呈坎的小飯館吃過一次，98 一條，一斤左右。以為是旅遊區的原因，蠻期待到了城市再吃個便宜的。誰想在太平，馬拉松前夜，那家飯館要價 108。</p><p>就算我是個並不那麼甘心隨波逐流的人，也難免被大眾情緒影響。那臭鱖魚，要説多好吃，也並沒有，不過就是更出名。和黃山一樣。</p><p>我馬拉松第二天從黃山下來後，跟朋友説，這些內陸的風景名勝，可能拜古人所見有限，如果是現在，文人墨客們能去得更遠，比如川西、比如西藏和新疆，甚至甘肅和雲南，大概都不會有「五嶽歸來不看山，黃山歸來不看嶽」這樣的感慨吧。</p><p>我因為剛跑完馬拉松，不敢逞強，選擇從北門乘纜車上山。黃山給了馬拉松選手免門票的待遇，但把這待遇集中到了賽後，北門原來接待能力就弱，一下子湧來幾千人，於是景區觀光車加上索道排隊便超過倆小時。北門那太平索道，是一個大轎廂，最多可容納 100 人，單向行駛，上去後再下來，才輪到下一波。纜車像高峯期的公交一樣，擠得水瀉不通。一些變坡點，又像海盜船一樣搖來晃去，惹得驚叫連連。景區心真大，乘客心也大。但乘客像社會系統裏的普通民眾，只能隨波逐流。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/e9ec9984-af47-48fc-86aa-0fc132b58c6c.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>纜車的轎廂</figcaption></figure><p>我本來想，賽後先去西遞和宏村，給腿腳個休息緩衝的餘地。可是北門這裏的交通系統，遠比我想像中落後，一去一來非常不便。加之跑完自我感覺好於預期，最終還是先上了山。計劃上下都乘纜車的。從太平索道終點爬到迎客松後，又覺得尚有餘力步行下山。於是便步行下山。假如不是馬拉松，以我的習慣和性格，上山也必定要爬之而後快。如果説這次黃山之行留下什麼遺憾，那便是沒登蓮花峯。蓮花峯是黃山之巔，「主峯突兀，小峯簇擁，儼若新蓮初開，仰天怒放「（百度百科語）。這次不是吹牛，我站在峯底仰望，看到遊客的身影在另人肅然起敬的高處拾級而上，也禁不住心馳神往。但我腿疼，時間也不允許，只能望峯興嘆。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ed59d8f8-2b54-4733-91e9-8879f88706b8.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>你得仔細，才能看到蓮花峯上的人影</figcaption></figure><p>下行路上，看到天都峯，為蓮花峯、光明頂之外的黃山第三主峯，和蓮花峯一樣高聳險峻，不過上山的梯步封鎖，無人身處其中。蓮花峯和天都峯輪休，現在正是天都峯的休養生息期。明年 4 月，它將出關面對遊客。相應的，蓮花峯那時將接替它進入為期五年的休養期。</p><p>做為爬山愛好者來講，想一次登完這兩座高峯，看來是不可能了。而這兩座黃山的門面，咫尺天涯，只能遙遙相望，無法執手相看。</p><p>在光明頂決定步行下山，斥十元巨資買了根烤腸補充能量，沒吃兩口，啪，掉地上了。好氣呀。想起小時候，門口來了賣冰棍的，我姐買了兩根，給我一根，我們站在門樓的陰影裏吃冰棍。也是沒嗦兩口，啪，在泥地上摔得粉碎。不知道為什麼後來這件事成了不斷回到我腦海中的記憶片段之一。但那記憶會分岔，有時候是我姐看我包起了眼淚花花，馬上又買了一根給我。另外一些時候，她斥責我不拿好，我惱羞成怒，罵罵咧咧比她還兇。那時候冰棍三分錢一根，放在一個包着棉套子的箱子裏，陽光熾烈，那箱子架在貨郎的自行車後座，走村串鄉」，冰棍……冰棍……「</p><p>光明頂下山步道起點那裏有個告示：步行下山 6.5 公里，需要 2.5 小時。我問賣烤腸的大叔，路不好嗎怎麼 6.5 公里需要那麼久？他説，反正抬滑桿的半個小時就到，你自己考量你的能力。我説那我知道了，我加一倍一個小時總能到的。實際花了一個半小時，路上很多一瘸一拐的」馬後炮「。我揹包很重，電腦裝在裏面，隨時準備處理工作事務，越走膝蓋越疼，平路上顫顫巍巍。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/3b0d30bd-3de3-4139-bedc-253e2128341e.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>」忸怩作態「的馬後炮們</figcaption></figure><p>路遇一位大叔，他也昨天跑了全馬，今天步行上山，又步行下山。他剛退休，下週末還要跑橫店。我真羨慕他，其碼不用背電腦。他説但是工資少了一半，我説錢哪兒能掙完。</p><p>晚上住在黃山南大門的湯山嶺，酒店的大牀，是兩個小牀拼就。我發了個動態，説這真離譜，能睡五個人。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/64d149f1-c386-475b-9108-75bc586f67cd.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>挑夫</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/132e7cfe-20e5-4e90-9e39-81e8a1e8cab3.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>黃山松</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b5ea1749-37a5-46a3-a2c9-a8e678d534fd.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>仙人指路</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/80014b65-958f-4ae1-bf0d-ad90e69a3066.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>山路</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/3d10dc39-cc5b-410f-b8a7-52e807a4a6f3.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>遠眺</figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/4680863e-6a8b-4fb3-bb3e-62010e674fc1.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>黃山松</figcaption></figure><p></p>

王菁</p><p></p><h2><strong>01.&nbsp;記錄先知的生平&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>1995 年，穆罕默德·阿克拉姆·納德維在牛津大學伊斯蘭研究中心做研究。當時，《紐約時報》稱穆斯林女性受教育程度低是因為伊斯蘭。為此而感到憤怒的他決定採取行動。他開始到古代阿拉伯抄本中搜尋女人的名字，特別是女學者的名字。</p><p>起初，他希望找出大概二三十人。但是，他説：「不久之後我意識到，在求知路上，活躍着大量的女人。有學者寫到，‘我和 70 個女人一起學習’。還有學者轉述 400 個女人轉述過的聖訓。」</p><p>對許多穆斯林來説，聖訓是古蘭之下第二重要的材料。聖訓是寫下來的，關於先知穆罕默德生平的記錄，即據説，他説過、做過什麼。聖訓對穆斯林來説極其重要，因為它們把古蘭的抽象信息轉化為日常細節。在伊斯蘭早期，致力於確定聖訓真實性的穆斯林學者批判地處理其原始資料。</p><p>納德維先是到聖訓集中搜尋女人的名字，那些聖訓集或眾所周知，或不那麼為人所知。他還深入考察了學者寫的關於其老師（無論男女）的傳記和報告。他的發現超出了他所有的預期。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/8adca59d-210b-412d-9988-8786d5bfb377.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>二十年來，納德維一直致力於把被歷史埋沒的女學者搶救出來。但他並非人們通常所説的自由主義穆斯林。他也不自詡女性主義者。納德維承認，「但女性主義和我在一點上是一致的。我的確相信女人一直被壓迫，我們應該努力捍衞她們的權利，給她們應有的榮譽。」</p><p>於是，他一開始寫的文章變成一本書，書又變成了百科全書。2021 年 1 月中旬，在二十多年的努力後，他終於完成了他的工作。如今，超過一萬個女人的傳記，被收入了一套一共 43 卷的百科全書。這個最終結果甚至讓在德國明斯特大學做研究的伊斯蘭教義學家迪娜·奧馬裏（Dina El Omari）吃驚。「我意識到有很多[女學者]，但事實證明竟然有這麼多，這令人震驚——的確，這讓整個研究變得更激動人心了。」</p><p>納德維也有一些激動人心的故事要講。以 7 世紀大馬士革的著名法學者烏姆·達爾（Umm al-Darda）為例。年輕時，她不但和男人一起學習，還和他們一起在清真寺裏，在男人禮拜的區域禮拜——這在今天的大多數清真寺裏都是不可想象的。還有生活在 11 世紀的麥加的卡里瑪·馬爾瓦奇亞（Karima al-Marwaziyya）。她抄錄的最重要的聖訓集——《布哈里聖訓集》——到今天都還被認為是最完整可靠的。</p><p>納德維估計，大約有四分之一的聖訓是女人傳下來的。而且，顯然，這些女人不但勤勉，而且縝密。「在涉及先知言行的時候，很多、很多男人被指控編造聖訓。但所有聖訓學者都確認，從來沒有一個女人在任何一條聖訓上撒謊，這是非常了不起的。」</p><p></p><h2><strong>02.&nbsp;男人出名，女人則被埋沒&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>可如果有這麼多博學的女穆斯林，且她們又是如此地勤勉認真，那麼，為什麼在她們之中，今天被人們記住的又如此之少呢？納德維用這樣一個例子來加以解釋：</p><p>「伊斯蘭的偉大學者之一，生活在 13 或 14 世紀的伊本·薩瑪尼（Ibn al-Sam’ani）記錄説，他曾經想和一個名叫卡里瑪的女人一起學習：‘我多次請求她兄弟允許我和她一起學習。但她兄弟總能找到理由不讓。’在這裏，你可以看到問題之所在：人們想讓自己的兒子或兄弟出名，把自己的姐妹藏起來。」</p><p>納德維竭力搶救這些被歷史埋沒的女人。但他並非人們所説的自由主義穆斯林。納德維一直和歐洲的 Fatwarat（德國的教法委員會）有合作，後者和穆斯林兄弟會有聯繫。他也不認為自己是女性主義者。</p><p>「但女性主義和我在一點上是一致的」，納德維承認，「我的確相信女人一直被壓迫，我們應該努力捍衞她們的權利，給她們應有的榮譽。我不喜歡的是那種在男人和女人之間劃等號的女性主義。」</p><figure class="image"><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>最終成果的嚐鮮：這本書是納德維四十卷女聖訓學者傳記詞典[阿語]的前言。在伊斯蘭的形成時期，博學的女人享有很高的公共地位和權威。數個世紀以來，女人為宗教知識而大量地遊學並經常造訪伊斯蘭世界最著名的清真寺和經學院。這個附有地圖的概論章節追溯了女性聖訓學習中心的傳播及其最終的衰落。</p><h2><strong>03.&nbsp;以傳統的名義進行阻撓&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>不過，他的作品對女穆斯林來説依然重要，因為它為她們提供了在爭取更多話語權時可以使用的令人信服的論證。畢竟，根據格努·葉爾麗（Gönül Yerli），一些男穆斯林在試圖剝奪女性權力的時候還在援引「傳統」。</p><p>葉爾麗是彭茨貝格清真寺的副主任，是德國伊斯蘭社羣的少數女領袖之一。一開始，一些巴伐利亞教親還不願意接受她擔任這個位置。葉爾麗還記得，「一位教親説：‘你知道的，聖訓説：如果女人擔任伊斯蘭共同體的領袖，那麼這個共同體就會被詛咒，她也永遠不得安寧。’」</p><figure class="image"><img

wadud）在紐約領拜的照片，攝影師 Don Emmert，圖源 AFP</figcaption></figure><p>男人會用宗教的論證來操縱女人，這種情況對迪娜·奧馬裏來説也不陌生。「據説，先知有這樣一條聖訓是這樣説的：如果男人邀請女人上牀而女人拒絕的話，那麼，天仙就會整夜詛咒她。當然，這是非常極端的例子了。但這的確説明女人遭到了迫害，人們利用宗教的理由來逼她們做她們不想做的事。」</p><p>根據格努·葉爾麗，為什麼這些説辭會如此地常見還有另一個理由：它們比古蘭更好理解。「古蘭的語言是複雜的，它也不會對每一個問題給出回答。事實上，老實説，它很少會回答具體的問題。」</p><h2><strong>04.&nbsp;質疑聖訓中厭女的內容&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>格努·葉爾麗和迪娜·奧馬裏都試圖在自己的工作、教學和對教親的關懷中與厭女的聖訓對抗。比如説，奧馬裏解釋説，穆罕默德是不是這些情緒的事實上的發起者這點是非常不確定的。畢竟，這些厭女的聖訓都沒有在現存的最古老的聖訓集中出現。「這點是相當值得注意的。它真會讓你停下來思考：這些厭女的聖訓與先知的傳記形成了如此鮮明的對照，以至於它們看起來十分地不對勁。」</p><p>奧馬裏説，只要女人有話語權，厭女的聖訓就會被糾正。比如説，在先知歸真後，他最喜歡的妻子之一阿伊莎就經常和他的同伴之一艾布·胡萊賴爭論。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/c514d636-5762-49c2-a2a2-3c63dc9abc50.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>本特·沙蒂（Bint al-Shāti）本名為 Aisha Abd al-Rahman（1913-1998 年），本特·沙蒂是她的筆名，意味「水邊的女兒」。她出生於埃及，不識字的母親在其十歲時，將女兒送至學校讀書認字。1950 年，阿伊莎獲得博士學位，並於當年在開羅剛成立的艾因夏姆斯大學下屬的女子學院擔任阿拉伯語文學教授。圖源維基百科</p><p>比如説，在艾布·胡萊賴説在男人禮拜時女人在他前方走過會壞了男人的拜功「的時候，阿伊莎在起誓後明確地説先知從來沒有説過那樣的話」，奧馬裏説。</p><p>阿伊莎本人也在多條聖訓中報告説，先知在自己房間禮拜的時候，就算她躺在牀上正對先知，先知也照樣禮拜。像這樣的例子表明，最終再次關注和承認這些古代女學者是多麼地重要。</p><p>納德維也同意這點。「如果女人不能為自己説話的話，那麼沒人會為她們説話。然後關於女人的錯誤想法會流行，這樣，就沒人再有能力捍衞她們了。」</p><h2><strong>最新文章（持續更新）</strong></h2><ol

                <![CDATA[<p>偉大的阿根廷作家博爾赫斯葬在日內瓦。在他的墓碑上有古英語和古諾斯的碑文，還有一行令人費解的西班牙文。墓碑上所刻的內容是作家自己定的，正和他決定要葬在日內瓦而非故土一樣。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/ea029102-6477-4cbf-acdd-b0dd94298379.webp/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>博爾赫斯墓正面（圖來自網絡）</figcaption></figure><p>由於一戰，博爾赫斯隨父母滯留於日內瓦度，在這裏度過了青少年時代，並學習了拉丁語和一些古英語，不過按他自己的標準，認為對古英語的學習非常有限。1921 年，博爾赫斯一家人回到了阿根廷。父親買了不少書給博爾赫斯，其是就包括當時威廉·莫里斯翻譯的冰島傳奇史詩薩迦。博爾赫斯也進一步掌握了古諾斯語和古英語，對冰島史詩極為喜愛，他的作品中經便經常引用薩迦。同時他對其他古代史詩很一樣着迷——《荷馬史詩》，《貝奧武夫》，古愛爾蘭的無名詩等等。他的短篇小説中都那些時期的詩人為主人公，如《鏡子與面具》、《烏恩德爾》，講述他們對詞句準確且精妙的追求。</p><p>博爾赫斯後來和他的父親一樣，因眼疾失明，這對於一個以閲讀和寫作的人來説痛苦無以復加，而且失明也是從視力減退逐漸開始的，在這種痛苦中，博爾赫斯或許意識到自己面對的這種無情的命運與許多英雄詩篇中講述鬥爭有相似之處。隨着視力的消退，博爾赫斯越來越依賴自己原來儲存的詞彙，而其中大部分是歐洲中世紀的文學。他後來在大學講授冰島史詩和盎格魯撒克遜詩歌以及其他英雄主題文學，來聽他課的一個人便是日裔阿根廷人瑪麗亞·兒玉。而從 1975 年起，她成了他餘生的祕書、嚮導和伴侶或者説他的另一雙眼睛。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/f2ca6e7e-12ce-495e-a891-f94996537f60.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>博爾赫斯與瑪麗亞·兒玉（圖片來自網絡）</figcaption></figure><p>當博爾赫斯被發現患有癌症時已是晚期，他和瑪麗亞·兒玉決定結婚。由於當時阿根廷法律不允許離婚和再婚，所以二人選擇去國外結婚，婚後直接去了日內瓦。在這個留下他美好記憶的地方生活了幾個月後，博爾赫斯離世。</p><p>博爾赫斯的墓地選在日內瓦，而墓碑的設計卻體現了一種普通人不會想到的組合。整體看上去的第一印象有點像北歐那些魯尼文石碑。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/1f88896f-ba19-4409-8673-9dd0d44716f7.webp/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>林迪斯法恩刻有維京人入侵的石碑（圖片來自網站）</figcaption></figure><p>博爾赫斯墓碑的正面有一羣穿着盔甲的戰士，這與英國林迪斯法恩島現存的那塊墓碑十分相似，而後者所展示的正是公元 793 年維京人過海襲擊這座島嶼的情景（詳情可見此處：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://matters.town/@Gyllebo/306519-%E7%BB%B4%E4%BA%AC%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%B2-%E4%BA%8C-%E5%AF%B9%E8%A5%BF%E9%83%A8%E7%9A%84%E4%BE%B5%E6%89%B0-%E4%B8%8A-bafyreigir5u4j7ppqa72jlfjtyinsfntv4mhtpcen7pci2btt73mvl2czi">https://matters.town/@Gyllebo/306519-%E7%BB%B4%E4%BA%AC%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%B2-%E4%BA%8C-%E5%AF%B9%E8%A5%BF%E9%83%A8%E7%9A%84%E4%BE%B5%E6%89%B0-%E4%B8%8A-bafyreigir5u4j7ppqa72jlfjtyinsfntv4mhtpcen7pci2btt73mvl2czi</a> ）。這一羣戰士浮雕上面是墓主人豪爾赫·路易斯·博爾赫斯的名字。浮雕下面有一行字，寫的是「...and ne forhtedon na」這行字下面是墓主人的生卒年「1899-1986」，旁邊是個凱爾特十字架。「...and ne forhtedon na」 是一句古英語，意思是「不要害怕」的意思，是從博爾赫斯翻譯並經常談及的詩歌「馬爾登之戰」中引用的。</p><p>關於馬爾登戰役也與維京人有關，公元 991 年，一隊維京海盜在英格蘭東南海岸的馬爾登附近登陸，並遭遇當地埃爾多曼·伯特諾斯率領的隊伍。維京人登陸時正逢漲潮，兩軍之間有一條狹窄的堤道，如果維京人繼續前進，英格蘭人應該很容易地打退他們。此時維京人首領，據稱是後來加冕為挪威國王的奧拉夫·特里格瓦松向伯特諾斯提出一個條件，等到潮水退去，這樣雙方才可以打一場「公平」的仗，而英格蘭人竟然同意了。在這首古英語詩歌的第 17 行，伯特諾斯對他的手説原地不動，「握緊你的盾牌」，，「不要害怕。」 從這首詩裏選一句，應是博爾赫斯想對自己説的。</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/b4391131-e1d7-4b24-80ec-3a63275c1199.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>博爾赫斯墓碑背面（圖片來自網絡）</figcaption></figure><p>博爾赫斯墓碑的背面正中是一艘維京船的浮雕，應取材於瑞典哥特蘭島的一塊魯尼文石碑。維京人的傳統中一向將船與死亡聯繫在一起：死亡是通向未知世界的最後一次偉大航行。博爾赫斯墓碑背面這艘船的上方是有一行字「Hann tekr sverthtt Gram ok leggri methal their abert」，這句話來自冰島沃爾松加薩迦中的一行，意為「他把出鞘的劍放在他們之間。這是冰島傳説中一對名叫西古爾德和布隆希爾德的夫婦，在死後要放一把無鞘的劍在中間，表示他們會更像夫妻。</p><p>而維京船浮雕下面還有一行墓主人母語西班牙語寫的「De Ulrica a Javier Otárola」，即」烏爾麗卡致哈維爾·奧塔羅拉」。烏爾麗卡和哈維爾是博爾赫斯的短篇小説《烏爾麗卡》中的兩個人物，這一故事由也是冰島傳奇中一小段改編而成，講述了一個年輕的挪威女子和老年男子之間的浪漫愛情故事。這個故事對瑪麗亞有着特殊的意義，因為她和博爾赫斯之間便用烏爾麗卡和哈維爾作為只有二人知道的暱稱。</p><p>一隻墓碑承載了這許多的背景和線索，也許只有博爾赫斯這樣的博學之人才會提前設計好，和他的一部部作品一樣，總是曲徑通幽，深意無限。</p><p><br class="smart"></p><p></p><p></p>
